## Recent Papers Using cBioPortal

### The Roles of TOPK in Tumorigenesis and Development: Structure, Mechanisms, Pathways, and Therapeutic Implications. (2026.0)

- **Research Area**: ['Review/Commentary', 'Biomarker discovery']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Pan-cancer']
- **Usage**: This is a comprehensive review paper on TOPK (T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase) in cancer. While the paper discusses TOPK expression patterns, mutations, and clinical significance across various cancer types, the abstract and introduction provided do not explicitly describe how cBioPortal was used. The paper appears to synthesize data from multiple sources including TCGA to discuss TOPK's role in tumorigenesis, but specific cBioPortal usage details are not evident in the provided sections.

### EGFR amplification and PI3K pathway mutations identify a subset of breast cancers that synergistically respond to EGFR and PI3K inhibition. (2026.0)

- **Research Area**: ['Biomarker discovery', 'Drug response/resistance', 'Precision medicine']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Breast cancer']
- **Usage**: Based on the abstract and introduction provided, cBioPortal usage is not explicitly mentioned in these sections. The study uses Caris Life Sciences data for NGS and survival analysis, but no direct reference to cBioPortal is found in the provided text. The paper may cite cBioPortal in the full text or methods section not provided here, but from the available content, cBioPortal usage cannot be confirmed.

### Secreted frizzled-related protein 1a regulates hematopoietic development in a dose-dependent manner. (2026.0)

- **Research Area**: ['Review/Commentary']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Leukemia/Lymphoma']
- **Usage**: This paper focuses on developmental biology research using zebrafish models to study hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) development. The paper mentions observations in hematopoietic cancers where SFRP1 variants can promote or inhibit tumor development, but there is no explicit description of cBioPortal usage in the abstract or introduction provided. The citation appears to be contextual, relating their developmental findings to cancer biology observations.

### Cohesin mutations and chromatin changes in cancer. (2026.0)

- **Research Area**: ['Review/Commentary', 'Biomarker discovery', 'Pathway analysis']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Pan-cancer']
- **Usage**: This is a review paper focusing on cohesin mutations across different cancer types. While the paper discusses recurrent mutations in cohesin complex genes (SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, STAG1, STAG2) identified through cancer exome sequencing studies, the abstract and introduction do not explicitly describe direct usage of cBioPortal. The paper likely cites cBioPortal as a reference resource for cancer genomics data, but specific usage details are not provided in the available text.

### Loss of FAT1 drives cyclophosphamide resistance in breast cancer via the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway. (2026.0)

- **Research Area**: ['Drug response/resistance', 'Biomarker discovery', 'Precision medicine']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Breast cancer']
- **Usage**: The paper mentions conducting comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analysis to identify FAT1 as a tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer. While cBioPortal is cited, the abstract and introduction do not provide explicit details about how cBioPortal was specifically used in the study. The research primarily focuses on patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis of custom patient samples.

### A Glycerophospholipid Metabolism-Based Prognostic Model Guides Osteosarcoma Therapy. (2026.0)

- **Research Area**: ['Biomarker discovery', 'Drug response/resistance', 'Immunotherapy', 'Precision medicine', 'Pathway analysis']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Other solid tumor']
- **Usage**: The paper does not explicitly describe how cBioPortal was used in the methodology. While the study analyzes mutation profiling and copy number alterations in osteosarcoma, there is no clear mention of cBioPortal in the abstract or introduction provided. The citation of cBioPortal may be for reference purposes or the actual usage details may be in the methods section not provided.

### Long-term oncologic outcomes of metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma after local therapy alone. (2026.0)

- **Research Area**: ['Biomarker discovery', 'Precision medicine']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Other solid tumor']
- **Usage**: The study used MSK-IMPACT targeted genomic sequencing panel data for 18 patients with metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. Genomic data including fraction of genome altered and CDKN2A copy number loss were correlated with disease-free survival outcomes. The analysis appears to have been performed using institutional data, likely accessed through cBioPortal infrastructure for MSK-IMPACT data.

### Loss of METTL3 m6A methyltransferase results in short-term progression and poor treatment outcome of bladder cancer patients. (2026.0)

- **Research Area**: ['Biomarker discovery', 'Precision medicine']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Other solid tumor']
- **Usage**: The study used cBioPortal to access and analyze the TCGA-BLCA cohort (n=412) as a validation cohort for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The authors likely used cBioPortal to obtain METTL3 expression data and clinical information from TCGA-BLCA to validate their findings regarding the association between METTL3 expression loss and poor survival outcomes in MIBC patients.

### Novel NOTCH2-NTRK1 fusion confers osimertinib resistance in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer by interacting with EGFR. (2026.0)

- **Research Area**: ['Drug response/resistance', 'Biomarker discovery', 'Precision medicine']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Lung cancer']
- **Usage**: Based on the abstract and introduction provided, there is no explicit mention of cBioPortal usage in this study. The paper focuses on experimental characterization of a novel NOTCH2-NTRK1 fusion gene using in vitro and in vivo models, phosphoproteomic analyses, and protein interaction studies. cBioPortal may be cited in the references but its specific use is not described in the provided text.

### Integrative analysis identifies PIGK as an oncogenic glycosylphosphatidylinositol transamidase subunit with prognostic, immunological, and therapeutic relevance in head and neck cancer. (2026.0)

- **Research Area**: ['Biomarker discovery', 'Drug response/resistance', 'Pathway analysis', 'Precision medicine']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Other solid tumor']
- **Usage**: The paper used cBioPortal to analyze PIGK expression, genomic alterations (copy number gains), and correlations with mutations in other genes (FAT1, CDKN2A, NOTCH1, CASP8) in head and neck cancer. The platform was likely used to access TCGA head and neck cancer data for multi-omics integration including gene expression, copy number analysis, and mutation profiling. The study integrated cBioPortal data with additional validation using tissue microarrays and in vitro experiments.
