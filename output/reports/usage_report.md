## Recent Papers Using cBioPortal

### The Roles of TOPK in Tumorigenesis and Development: Structure, Mechanisms, Pathways, and Therapeutic Implications. (2026)

- **Research Area**: ['Review/Commentary', 'Biomarker discovery']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Pan-cancer']
- **Usage**: This is a comprehensive review paper about TOPK (T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase) in cancer. While the paper discusses TOPK expression patterns across various cancer types and its role in tumorigenesis, the abstract and introduction provided do not explicitly mention cBioPortal usage. The paper appears to be a literature review synthesizing existing knowledge about TOPK structure, mechanisms, pathways, and therapeutic implications rather than presenting original data analysis using cBioPortal.

### EGFR amplification and PI3K pathway mutations identify a subset of breast cancers that synergistically respond to EGFR and PI3K inhibition. (2026)

- **Research Area**: ['Biomarker discovery', 'Drug response/resistance', 'Precision medicine']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Breast cancer']
- **Usage**: While the abstract does not explicitly detail cBioPortal usage, the study investigates EGFR amplification frequency (1-5% of breast cancer patients) and co-occurring PI3K pathway mutations (up to 71% of EGFR amplified tumors) across breast cancer patient cohorts, which are typical analyses performed using cBioPortal. The authors analyzed genomic alterations and survival outcomes in breast cancer patients to identify a subset with EGFR amplification and PI3K pathway mutations that may benefit from dual targeted therapy. Given that cBioPortal is cited and the study performs comprehensive genomic and clinical outcome analyses across breast cancer cohorts, it was likely used to query mutation frequencies, copy number alterations, and survival data.

### Secreted frizzled-related protein 1a regulates hematopoietic development in a dose-dependent manner. (2026)

- **Research Area**: ['Other']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Not specified']
- **Usage**: This paper does not appear to use cBioPortal data or tools. The study focuses on developmental biology research using zebrafish models to investigate the role of Sfrp1a in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell development. The mention of hematopoietic cancers in the abstract appears to be contextual background rather than indicating actual analysis of cancer genomics data from cBioPortal.

### Cohesin mutations and chromatin changes in cancer. (2026)

- **Research Area**: ['Review/Commentary']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Pan-cancer']
- **Usage**: This is a review paper that discusses cohesin mutations across different cancer types. While cBioPortal is cited as a reference, the abstract and introduction do not provide specific details about how cBioPortal data was directly used or analyzed in this review. The paper likely references cBioPortal as a source for mutation prevalence data across cancer types, but specific usage details are not evident from the provided text.

### Investigating the role of oncogenic FAM83A as a prognostic biomarker in lung adenocarcinoma: Insights from smoker and non-smoker cohorts. (2025)

- **Research Area**: ['Biomarker discovery', 'Pathway analysis', 'Immunotherapy']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Lung cancer']
- **Usage**: The study utilized cBioPortal to access and analyze TCGA-LUAD cohort data for identifying prognostic biomarkers in lung adenocarcinoma. The platform was used to examine FAM83A amplification patterns and validate the prognostic significance of meta-differentially expressed genes. Additionally, cBioPortal facilitated the analysis of copy number alterations and their correlation with immune cell infiltration in LUAD samples from smokers and non-smokers.

### Clinical and Molecular Characterization of KRAS-Mutated Renal Cell Carcinoma. (2025)

- **Research Area**: ['Biomarker discovery', 'Precision medicine']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Other solid tumor']
- **Usage**: This study identified KRAS-mutant renal cell carcinoma patients from the MSK-IMPACT cohort and TCGA-KIRP (Kidney Renal Papillary Cell Carcinoma) cohort. The researchers used these genomic databases to characterize clinical and molecular features of KRAS-mutated RCC, performing mutation analysis, copy-number alterations evaluation using FACETS, and RNA-sequencing analysis on available samples. The study utilized cBioPortal-accessible datasets to identify three distinct KRAS-mutant RCC subtypes and assess their clinical outcomes.

### Synergy in Immunostimulatory and Pro-Differentiation Effects of Vitamin D Analog and Fludarabine in Acute Myeloid Leukemias. (2025)

- **Research Area**: ['Drug response/resistance', 'Biomarker discovery']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Leukemia/Lymphoma']
- **Usage**: Based on the abstract and introduction provided, the specific usage of cBioPortal is not explicitly described. The paper focuses on investigating differentiation therapy combining vitamin D analog (PRI5202) and Fludarabine in AML cells, particularly those with activating mutations in FGFR and JAK pathways. cBioPortal may have been used to identify or validate mutation patterns in AML, but the exact usage is not detailed in the provided text.

### N<sup>6</sup>-Methyladenosine: an RNA modification as a central regulator of cancer. (2025)

- **Research Area**: ['Review/Commentary', 'Drug response/resistance', 'Biomarker discovery', 'Immunotherapy']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Pan-cancer', 'Leukemia/Lymphoma']
- **Usage**: This is a review paper discussing N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification in cancer. Based on the abstract and introduction provided, there is no explicit mention of cBioPortal usage in the text. The paper appears to cite cBioPortal as a reference resource but does not describe specific analyses or data retrieval from the platform in the sections provided.

### EIF3M as a pan-cancer biomarker: prognostic significance and immune infiltration association. (2025)

- **Research Area**: ['Biomarker discovery', 'Immunotherapy', 'Pathway analysis']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Pan-cancer', 'Other solid tumor']
- **Usage**: cBioPortal was likely used as one of the publicly available databases to access multi-omics cancer data for the comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of EIF3M. The platform would have provided access to gene expression, copy number alterations, methylation data, and clinical outcomes across multiple cancer types. Given the study's focus on gene amplification, expression patterns, and survival analysis across various tumors, cBioPortal served as a key resource for retrieving and analyzing TCGA and other cancer genomics datasets.

### A Prognostic Neuromodulation-Related Gene Signature Identifies Immunomodulation and Tumour-Associated Hallmarks in Glioblastoma. (2025)

- **Research Area**: ['Biomarker discovery', 'Pathway analysis']
- **Cancer Type**: ['Glioma/Brain cancer']
- **Usage**: Based on the abstract and introduction provided, there is no explicit mention of cBioPortal usage in this study. The paper describes using transcriptomic data from TCGA, CGGA, and GEO databases (GSE147352, GSE165595) to identify differentially expressed neuromodulation-related genes and construct a prognostic signature for glioblastoma. While the study uses TCGA data, which is available through cBioPortal, the paper does not specifically mention accessing or analyzing data through the cBioPortal platform.
