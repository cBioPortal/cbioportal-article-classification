The findings were used to propose targeted therapeutic approaches including PI3K-Akt pathway inhibitors (taselisib) for LS-associated CRC and Wnt pathway inhibitors (XAV939) for sporadic CRC.","['TCGA-COAD', 'TCGA-READ']",medium,,39973357,Distinct dysregulated pathways in sporadic and Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal cancer offer insights for targeted treatment.,2025,abstract,2025-12-19T02:47:21.973790
