The researchers used cBioPortal to extract mutation data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes to investigate gender-biased differences in KDM6A mutation effects on immune therapy response. The platform enabled comprehensive analysis across multiple cohorts to correlate KDM6A mutation status with survival outcomes and immune-related features stratified by gender.",
