          "abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in smokers and non-smokers presents distinct clinical characteristics, including differences in genetics, treatment response, and prognosis. To explore these differences, we conducted a meta-analysis using publicly accessible LUAD datasets, identifying meta-differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in smokers and non-smokers. A total of 29meta-DEGs were discovered, with seven (CLDN2, CLDN18, CYP4B1, CYP4X1, FAM83A, HLF, and PLA2G1B) demonstrating prognostic significance in the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Among these, FAM83A was particularly noteworthy for its amplification in LUAD samples and its negative correlation with immune cell infiltration. Functional enrichment analysis revealed key pathways, such as cytochrome P450 metabolism and cell-cell adhesion, which may be critical in LUAD progression. Our findings highlight FAM83A as a potential prognostic biomarker with significant implications for treatment strategies, especially concerning immune modulation. This study offers a more comprehensive insight into the molecular differences in LUAD in smokers and non-smokers and lays the groundwork for targeted therapies tailored to these subgroups.",

Beyond this entity, the broader clinicopathologic and molecular features of <i>KRAS</i>-mutated RCC remain insufficiently characterized. This study aimed to provide a descriptive assessment of <i>KRAS</i>-mutated RCC. <i>KRAS</i>-mutant RCC patients were identified from the Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) and The Cancer Genome Atlas Kidney Renal Papillary Cell Carcinoma (TCGA-KIRP) cohorts. Copy-number alterations were evaluated using Fraction and allele-specific copy number estimates from tumor sequencing (FACETS). Available samples were used for immunohistochemistry and RNA-sequencing analysis. Seventeen patients were included. Three distinct <i>KRAS</i>-mutant RCC subtypes were identified: <i>KRAS</i>-mutant PRCC (35%), <i>KRAS</i>-mutant URCC (35%), and PRNRP (29%). Seven patients (41%) had metastatic disease; none were PRNRP. RNA-based deconvolution analysis revealed that PRNRP had enrichment in distal nephron components, whereas <i>KRAS</i>-mutant PRCC was enriched in proximal tubule cells (<i>p</i> = 0.02). IHC staining of L1CAM was positive in PRNRP but negative in <i>KRAS</i>-mutant PRCC, supporting their distinct cell-of-origin phenotypes. This study is limited by its cohort size, which influences the availability of tissue samples. PRNRP represents a distinct <i>KRAS</i>-mutant RCC subtype with unique metabolic and genomic features linked to its distal nephron origin. This contrasts with the genomic complexity and aggressive clinical behavior observed in <i>KRAS</i>-mutant PRCC and URCC, highlighting the need for subtype-specific diagnostic criteria and therapeutic strategies.",

          "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive and often fatal hematopoietic malignancy, diagnosed predominantly in the elderly. The five-year survival of patients with AML is as low as 30%. Differentiation therapy of a subtype of AML, named acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), using all-<i>trans</i> retinoic acid (ATRA) was the most successful example of a targeted therapy against AML. Epigenetic-based differentiation therapies for other subtypes of AML are also showing improvements in response and in survival rates. Thus, in this study, we investigated a potential differentiation therapy with a combination of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) analog (named PRI5202) and low concentration of Fludarabine. We show that such a combination elicits immunostimulatory and pro-differentiation effects in AML cells, specifically in those with activating mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and Janus kinase (JAK) pathways. We show here that both PRI5202 and Fludarabine are potent activators of the transcription of many innate immunity-related genes, and that, in combination, their effects are in many aspects synergistic. We propose that such a low-intensity regimen may be suitable for older patients with AML, who are unfit for intensive chemotherapy. We also present data indicating that PRI5202 induces myeloid differentiation in blasts from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and we propose to further investigate PRI5202 as a differentiation therapy for patients suffering from MDS.",

          "abstract": "TOPK (T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase), also known as PDZ-binding kinase, is a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. It is a critical regulator of essential cellular processes, including survival, proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation, and autophagy. As an oncogenic kinase, TOPK is predominantly expressed in actively proliferating cells, where its dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of various cancers. Through phosphorylation, TOPK activates key signaling pathways such as ERK/RSK/c-Jun, which in turn promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, and resistance to apoptosis. Furthermore, TOPK has been implicated in the regulation of the tumor microenvironment and immune evasion. This review provides an in-depth examination of the molecular structure of TOPK, the role of TOPK in tumorigenesis, and the underlying mechanisms that support its oncogenic activity. Given its central role in cancer progression, TOPK represents a promising candidate for novel cancer therapies. Additionally, we explore the therapeutic potential of targeting TOPK in cancer treatment, highlighting ongoing research efforts and the challenges in translating TOPK inhibition into clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "EIF3M, a core subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, plays a pivotal role in protein synthesis by regulating the assembly of the 43S initiation complex. However, its biological functions in cancer remain poorly understood. To further investigate the clinical translational value and underlying mechanisms of EIF3M in tumors, this study conducted comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of EIF3M across various tumor types. We utilized publicly available databases to perform a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of EIF3M's biological roles in oncogenesis, aiming to elucidate its pan-cancer expression patterns and prognostic significance. Furthermore, we conducted an integrative multi-omics analysis incorporating methylation profiling, co-expressed gene networks, targeted miRNA interactions, and tumor immune microenvironment infiltration to decipher the complex regulatory architecture and biological pathways mediated by EIF3M across cancer types. Finally, we used HCC cell lines for <i>in vitro</i> functional validation, determining how EIF3M expression modulates malignant phenotypic behaviors in hepatocellular carcinoma. EIF3M was overexpressed in multiple cancers and correlated with advanced tumor stage and poor survival. Its dysregulation was primarily driven by gene amplification and regulated by promoter methylation and miRNAs. EIF3M functioned as a hub in cell cycle and transcriptional networks and was linked to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. In hepatocellular carcinoma models, EIF3M modulated tumor proliferation, migration, and activated oncogenic pathways like Wnt/\u03b2-catenin. This study reveals that EIF3M expression correlates with immune infiltration and poor prognosis in multiple cancers. In vitro experiments in hepatocellular carcinoma models demonstrated that <i>EIF3M</i> critically regulates malignant cell behaviors. Collectively, our findings highlight EIF3M's value as a promising pan-cancer biomarker worthy of further investigation for its utility in prognosis prediction and as an indicator of immunotherapeutic response.",

Nonetheless, the association between neuromodulation-related genes (NMRGs) and GBM prognosis remains elusive. Hence, this study aims to identify clinically significant NMRGs that can form a prognostic gene signature for GBM patients. <b>Methods and Results</b>: Differential expression analysis of transcriptomic profiles extracted from GSE147352, GSE165595, TCGA and CGGA determined 272 differentially expressed NMRGs (deNMRGs) in GBM compared to normal brain tissue. The subsequent Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard model further identified ten common deNMRGs (<i>IGF2</i>, <i>RETN</i>, <i>EDNRB</i>, <i>C3AR1</i>, <i>CLCF1</i>, <i>NTRK1</i>, <i>OSMR</i>, <i>KCNN4</i>, <i>SLC18A3</i> and <i>HTR7</i>), forming a 10-NMRG signature. This signature stratifies GBM patients and consistently predicts poorer survival outcomes for the high-risk score group compared to the low-risk score group in the TCGA and CGGA cohorts. The gene set enrichment analysis and active-subnetwork-oriented enrichment analysis identified a connection between immunomodulation and tumour-associated hallmarks with the high-risk GBM patient group. Next, the correlation proportionality analysis identified a positive association between the signature genes with immune activators, immune suppressors and pro-motility genes. Additionally, high expressions of the 10-NMRGs were noted in the mesenchymal GBM subtype. <b>Conclusions</b>: Collectively, our analysis highlights the potential use of the 10-NMRG signature to stratify the high-risk GBM group with a strong association of immunomodulation and tumour-associated hallmarks that can contribute to the poor survival outcomes.",

Although studies have investigated dual EGFR/PI3K inhibition in breast cancer, they have not determined biomarkers which predict success. We present evidence of a patient subset with EGFR amplification and PI3Kinase pathway mutations in breast cancer which can be synergistically targeted by dual EGFR/PI3K inhibition. This study identified that EGFR amplification occurs in ~1-5% of breast cancer patients with shorter overall survival compared to unamplified patients. Up to 71% of EGFR amplified tumors have activating mutations in the PI3K pathway. Dual EGFR/PI3K inhibition more dramatically reduced mTOR and AKT signaling in BT20 and MDA-MB-468 cells which both have EGFR amplification and PI3K pathway activating mutations, compared to control cells. Dual inhibition synergistically reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 and BT20 compared to control. Single agent therapy in a BT20 xenograft model reduced tumor volume, however only the combination statistically significantly reduced tumor volume compared to control. We conclude that EGFR amplification with co-incident PI3K pathway mutations are driver mutations in a subset of breast cancers and present a subgroup of breast cancers that are more likely to respond to dual targeted therapy.",

          "abstract": "IntroductionDNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired via homologous recombination (HR) or the more error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). <i>breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1)</i> and <i>breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA2)</i> are key genes in HR, and their mutations are associated with aggressive prostate cancer (PCa). While PARP inhibitors (PARPi) improve survival in BRCA-mutated PCa, their efficacy in late-stage disease is limited and often accompanied by serious side effects. This study aims to develop an in vitro model of BRCA-mutated PCa and evaluate the therapeutic potential of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) inhibitors that target the NHEJ pathway.MethodsThe genes <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> were targeted for knockout (KO) in lymphnode cancer of the prostate (cell line) [LNCaP] using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 technology. The KO were assessed via Western blot analysis. Scramble LNCaP, <i>BRCA1</i> KO, and <i>BRCA2</i> KO cells were treated with the PARPi talazoparib, the DNA-PK inhibitor nedisertib and their combination. The impact on cell proliferation was evaluated using the CellTiter-Glo assay and synergy of the treatments was analyzed with SynergyFinder. Cytotoxic effects were measured by flow cytometry using an Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) apoptosis detection kit. The presence of DSB was quantified using immunofluorescence.ResultsBRCA2 and BRCA1 protein expression were successfully downregulated in the knockout (KO) cell lines. After two days of treatment with talazoparib and/or nedisertib, a significant decrease in cell proliferation was observed. Additive effects of the combination treatment were detected exclusively in the BRCA KO cells. These cells also exhibited significantly higher rates of necrosis after treatment compared to scramble cells and, DNA DSB were significantly more prevalent in the BRCA KO cells. Additionally, BRCA1/2 loss is inversely correlated with DNA-PK, with knockout leading to increased DNA-PK expression to support NHEJ.ConclusionBRCA knockout LNCaP models were established, exhibiting increased DNA-PK activity and indicating greater susceptibility to DNA-PK inhibition. Therapeutically targeting NHEJ presents a promising approach in treating BRCA-mutated PCa. Further <i>in vivo</i> investigations are required to assess the tolerability of this drug combination.",

Through integrated pan-cancer multiomics and experimental analyses, we mapped the expression and mutational landscape of GCKR with a focus on gastric cancer. GCKR expression was downregulated in most tumors but upregulated in subsets such as kidney renal papillary carcinoma (KIRP) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Genomic profiling revealed recurrent alterations, with the highest mutation frequencies observed in sarcoma (SARC) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), and missense mutations representing the predominant variant type, particularly in breast cancer (BRCA). Functionally, reduced GCKR expression in gastric cancer was associated with an immune-cold phenotype characterized by diminished cytotoxic T cell infiltration, impaired antigen presentation, and metabolic reprogramming. Spatial transcriptomics and single-cell analyses highlighted compartment-specific heterogeneity and links with cancer-associated fibroblasts and macrophages. Clinically, low GCKR expression predicted poorer survival and reduced immunotherapy benefit, while higher expression indicated selective sensitivity to MEK inhibitors including refametinib and PD0325901. These findings define GCKR as both a mutation- and expression-driven biomarker that connects metabolic regulation with immune remodeling, offering translational value for prognosis and precision therapy in gastric cancer.",

This study aimed to identify the roles of FA metabolism and search for potential therapeutic targets. The genomic and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-LUAD cohort underwent univariate and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analyses to establish a FA metabolism-related gene (FAMG) signature. Immunotherapy efficacy was evaluated via the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithm. Pharmacological sensitivity to conventional chemotherapeutic agents and molecular targeted therapies was evaluated using the \"pRRophetic\" R package. Through integrative multi-omics analysis, <i>ANLN</i> was identified as a key gene with significant prognostic value. Gene silencing via small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection was employed for functional validation. We further analyzed the biological role and mechanism of <i>ANLN</i> through bioinformatics and experimental analyses in LUAD cell lines. The FAMG prognostic signature indicated clinical utility in predicting patient outcomes and stratifying survival probabilities. The signature showed predictive capacity for therapeutic responses across immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted drugs, supporting precision oncology applications. Experimental validation confirmed that <i>ANLN</i> knockdown significantly attenuated malignant phenotypes through impairing cellular proliferation and migration, enhancing apoptotic induction in LUAD. Mechanistically, we discovered for the first time that <i>ANLN</i> knockdown inhibited FA synthesis, glycolysis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by downregulating the AKT/mTOR/HIF-1\u03b1 signaling axis, representing a novel regulatory mechanism in LUAD metabolism. This work delineates FA metabolic heterogeneity and its predictive function of personalized treatment in LUAD. <i>ANLN</i> is established as both a prognostic biomarker and metabolic regulator through modulation of the AKT/mTOR/HIF-1\u03b1 signaling axis. Our findings provide a framework for developing metabolism-targeted treatment strategies.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and the role of the transcription factor SPDEF remains controversial. We aimed to clarify the prognostic value of SPDEF, explore demographic and molecular correlates of its expression, and investigate potential regulatory mechanisms underlying its dysregulation. Genomic and clinical data for 1218 breast cancer tumors were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). SPDEF mRNA expression was compared across intrinsic subtypes, age, and race, and prognostic significance was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Promoter methylation patterns and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) expression were examined as potential regulatory drivers. Co-expression analysis was performed using gene panels representing luminal differentiation, basal identity, EMT, proliferation, DNA repair, and immune signaling. Low SPDEF expression was significantly associated with worse overall, relapse-free, and metastasis-free survival across all breast cancers. Expression was lowest in Basal tumors, as well as among younger and Black or African American patients. Promoter methylation at six CpG islands correlated with both reduced SPDEF expression and inferior survival, and DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B overexpression also aligned with poor prognosis and Basal enrichment. Co-expression analysis revealed that SPDEF downregulation coincided with loss of luminal markers and increased EMT, proliferation, DNA repair, and immune pathways. SPDEF functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, with reduced expression linked to poor outcomes, aggressive molecular features, and epigenetic regulation. These findings highlight SPDEF and DNMT-driven methylation as potential prognostic biomarkers for enhanced risk stratification and targets for novel therapies, particularly in Basal breast cancers.",

However, their specific roles in OSCC remain unclear. We integrated analyses of SCC-4 tongue cancer cells with CHRNA overexpression, immunohistochemistry of OSCC pathological specimens, and data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), DepMap, and Puram 2017 to assess CHRNA3, CHRNA5, and CHRNA7 in OSCC/HNC. In OSCC, CHRNA3, CHRNA5, and CHRNA7 expression interacted with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and correlated with invasive patterns. CHRNA3 reduced epithelial and enhanced mesenchymal traits, supporting EMT. CHRNA5 further promoted mesenchymal features, was linked to disseminated tumor patterns, and predicted poor prognosis. CHRNA7 enhanced both epithelial and mesenchymal markers, maintaining a hybrid EMT state. In HNC, bioinformatic analyses revealed that CHRNA3 preserved ion channel activity, CHRNA5 promoted DNA replication, reduced adhesion, suppressed antigen presentation, and induced hypomethylation and miRNA overexpression, while CHRNA7 promoted differentiation with variable effects on adhesion and antigen presentation. In DepMap HNC cell lines, high CHRNA3/CHRNA5 and low CHRNA7 expression were associated with resistance to most inhibitors. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors were effective in CHRNA3/CHRNA7-high HNC, whereas cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors were effective in CHRNA5-high HNC. Differential expression of CHRNA3, CHRNA5, and CHRNA7 indicates different EMT states in OSCC/HNC, influencing proliferation, differentiation, cell adhesion, immune reactions, and treatment efficacy, and warrants further experimental validation.",

The tumor microenvironment is comprised of tumor, immune, and stromal cell types that communicate through secreted and cell surface proteins. This can be represented by a weighted, directed network where pairs of cell types communicate via multiple ligand-receptor interactions with varying strengths. Identifying interaction network motifs that are linked with outcome or evolve pre- to post-ICI presents a rational framework to identify combination therapeutic targets. Interaction inference was performed on publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing data from melanoma patients. The constructed patient-specific networks were input to multivariate statistical learning approaches to identify network motifs that predicted response pre-treatment and that shifted pre- to post-treatment. Relevance of interactions was validated by (1) differential expression of related pathways in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, (2) survival associations in an independent bulk RNA-seq dataset, and (3) repeated analyses of scRNA-seq data in a second cohort. Immune-immune interactions with roles in T cell activation, chemotaxis, and adhesion were upregulated in patients who respond to therapy pre-treatment. Related pathways were perturbed in involved immune cells and expression of these genes was associated with improved survival. The interactome also distinguished pre- and post-treatment biopsies with high accuracy despite no significant differences in individual interactions. Analysis in the validation dataset with mixed responses pre-treatment recapitulated results from the discovery analyses. Unbiased analysis of interaction networks and their evolution is a powerful framework to guide prognostic indicators and novel combination targets to improve patient outcomes.

Our data reveal novel oncogenic functionality for the two hotspot mutations N546K and K656E, linked to evasion of lysosomal degradation. Further, we identified a modulatory tumor-suppressive role for the susceptibility variant R661P, which hampers the oncogenic potential of both hotspot N546K and K656E mutations by rescuing receptor degradation and reducing N546K affinity for the downstream effector PLC\u03b3. Introducing the R661P missense variant was sufficient to abolish self-renewal capacity of oligodendroglioma cells and downregulate genes involved in neurodevelopment and neuro-glial cell fate decisions, both aspects overcome in the double mutants.

With the option of broad molecular testing, it is crucial that clinicians are aware of the a priori probability of finding germline predisposition in glioblastoma patients. Here, we studied the genetic predisposition to adult glioblastoma using paired tumor-normal WGS data in an unselected, average cohort of 92 glioma WHO grade 4 patients. In 10 patients (11%), 12 Pathogenic Germline Variants (PGVs) were found in genes strongly associated with familial glioblastoma (MSH6 (3x), PMS2 (5x), MSH2, NF1, BRCA1) or medulloblastoma (SUFU). In six of these patients (60%), causality was supported by a second (somatic) event and/or a matching genome-wide mutational signature. Thus, germline predisposition does play a role in the development of adult glioblastoma, with mismatch repair deficiency being the main mechanism. Our results also highlight the benefits of tumor-normal WGS for glioblastoma patients and their families, beyond identifying actionable mutations for therapy.",

While the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pembrolizumab has demonstrated efficacy in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), its benefit in HR\u2009+\u2009subtypes is limited. ICI resistance in breast cancer is largely due to a \"cold\" tumor immune microenvironment characterized by low tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). To identify novel genetic determinants of immune exclusion and pembrolizumab resistance, we analyzed multi-omics and clinical datasets from the I-SPY2 clinical trial and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), focusing on genes associated with low T cell infiltration and poor response to pembrolizumab. We identified thrombospondin type-1 domain containing 4 (THSD4) as a top candidate. THSD4 expression was significantly elevated in breast tumors with low T cells and in breast cancer patients exhibiting resistance to pembrolizumab, particularly within the HR\u2009+\u2009subtype. THSD4 expression is enriched in HR\u2009+\u2009breast cancers. Validation in local patient cohorts using RNA sequencing and multiplex immunofluorescence confirmed that both high THSD4 expression and anti-THSD4 antibody staining correlated with reduced T cell infiltration in the tumor epithelium and associations with poorer clinical outcomes. Functional studies in a syngeneic mouse HR\u2009+\u2009tumor model demonstrated that THSD4 promotes an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, with reduced T cells, resistance to anti-PD-1, and altered collagen fiber abundance. Collectively, these findings establish THSD4 as a prognostic biomarker of pembrolizumab resistance and a potential therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in breast cancer.",

          "abstract": "Lactate, the primary byproduct of glycolysis, has been established as a critical barometer of tumor microenvironment homeostasis and is implicated in tumor progression. Alanyl-tRNA synthetases AARS1 and AARS2 (AARS1/2) have been identified as sensors of intracellular L-lactate and as contributors to cancer development. Nonetheless, investigations into the different roles of AARS1 and AARS2 across various cancer types remain lacking. In this study, we preliminarily explored the correlations between AARS1/2 and the tumor microenvironment in pan-cancer. We first examined the expression patterns of AARS1 and AARS2 across 33 cancer types. Subsequently, we analyzed the relationship of AARS1/2 with clinical features and mutational landscape utilizing the GSCA and cBioPortal databases. Survival outcomes associated with AARS1/2 were assessed through Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier method. Additionally, we examined the correlations between AARS1/2 and drug sensitivity, as well as immune infiltration, using the GSCA database, TISIDB database, and the CIBERSORT algorithm, respectively. Notably, significant heterogeneity of AARS1 and AARS2 was observed across various dimensions, including expression profiles, clinical outcomes, mutation spectra, and immune infiltration. The expression patterns of AARS1/2 were statistically different in urologic neoplasms. Similarly, survival analysis revealed a close correlation between elevated AARS1 expression and unfavorable prognosis in patients with urologic neoplasms, while AARS2 expression level was not. Interestingly, the results of immune infiltration indicated the statistical heterogeneity of AARS1 and AARS2 in certain urologic neoplasms, especially in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA). Specifically, (1) the correlation between AARS1/2 expression and immune-related scores in BLCA was opposite; and (2) TIDE analysis demonstrated that elevated AARS1 expression was related to a high TIDE score in BLCA, while AARS2 was not. Further detailed analysis of AARS1 and AARS2 in the context of immune infiltration and functional enrichment in BLCA may partially account for these observations. In conclusion, our findings highlighted the heterogeneity of AARS1 and AARS2 across various cancers. Based on our data, AARS1 was identified as a potential prognostic biomarker and a candidate for immunotherapy targeting in urologic cancers, though further validation is needed to confirm its clinical utility.",

          "abstract": "Challenges in predicting which neoantigens mediate tumor rejection limit the efficacy of neoantigen vaccines to treat cancers, especially for cancers with a high mutational burden like cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Only a small portion of neoantigens prioritized by current methods elicit effective T cell responses, demonstrating the critical need for improved criteria for the prediction of tumor-rejecting neoantigens. Publicly available human cSCC datasets were used to assess the frequency of shared mutations between patients. A transplantable ultraviolet light-induced mouse model of cSCC was generated. The mutational signature and driver mutations in the mouse model were compared with human tumors. Neoantigens were prioritized in the mouse model, and tumor-rejecting neoantigens were identified through (enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) and in vivo prophylactic vaccination. Binding of the neoantigens and corresponding wild-type peptides to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I was determined. Structural modeling of peptide:MHC complexes was performed to assess for changes in structural characteristics of the neoantigens relative to the wild-type peptides. A minority of human cSCC tumors shared neoantigens. The mouse cSCC model recapitulated the mutational signature and driver mutations found in human disease and was constrained by CD8 T cells. Two MHC class I neoantigens were identified in the mouse model that constrained cSCC growth. One tumor-rejecting neoantigen exhibited improved MHC binding, and the other had increased solvent accessibility of the mutated residue, compared with wild-type. Across known neoantigens that do not impact MHC binding, increased exposure of the mutated residue distinguished tumor-rejecting from non-immunogenic neoantigens. Given the paucity of shared mutations, this work supports the need for personalized neoantigen vaccines in cSCC. To facilitate further discovery, we provide a clinically relevant mouse cSCC model with two defined neoantigens that mediate tumor rejection. Structural changes in the exposure of features that promote T cell receptor recognition defined tumor-rejecting neoantigens. Incorporation of structural modeling to predict changes in T cell receptor accessibility is anticipated to improve the selection of neoantigens for inclusion in personalized cancer vaccines.",

We employed a 'Toxicological Prediction-Causal Inference-Structural Validation' framework, integrating network toxicology and Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis, enabling insights into BPA's carcinogenic effects. This approach used network toxicology to predict molecular targets of BPA in the ovary, MR to establish genetic evidence for the causal link, and molecular docking to validate structural basis of interaction with key pathways. Our findings indicate BPA may influence cellular processes, including homeostasis, stress, and cycle regulation, while activating PI3K/Akt signaling. Enrichment analysis revealed pathways associated with amoebic infection, suggesting interactions between infection status and chemical exposure. With evidence that emetine enhances cancer cell sensitivity, we hypothesize BPA may activate inflammation pathways shared with amoebic infection, particularly in predisposed individuals. Consequently, BPA might induce inflammatory microenvironment, thereby influencing progression and treatment response. This study identifies CTRC/PRDX1/SKP1 as crucial and proposes hypothesis of synergistic effects between exposure and infection history. These findings underscore incorporating environmental exposure into risk assessment, offering perspectives on carcinogenesis and avenues for prevention.",

Although this issue has been studied extensively for chemotherapy, less is known about a causal link between resistance to radiation therapy and metastasis. We investigated this problem in triple-negative breast cancer and established that radiation-resistant tumor cells have enhanced metastatic capacity. Resistance to radiation increases the expression of integrin \u03b23 (<i>ITGB3</i>), which promotes enhanced migration and invasion. Bioinformatic analysis and subsequent experimentation revealed an enrichment of RNA metabolism pathways that stabilize <i>ITGB3</i> transcripts. Specifically, the RNA binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (<i>HNRNPL</i>), whose expression is regulated by Nrf2, mediates the formation of circular RNAs that sponge the family of let-7 microRNAs that target <i>ITGB3</i>.

          "abstract": "Prioritizing actionable drug targets is a critical challenge in cancer research, where high-dimensional genomic data and the complexity of tumor biology often hinder effective prioritization. To address this, we developed GETgene-AI, a novel computational framework that integrates network-based prioritization, machine learning, and automated literature analysis to prioritize and rank potential therapeutic targets. Central to GETgene-AI is the G.E.T. strategy, which combines three data streams: mutational frequency (G List), differential expression (E List), and known drug targets (T List). These components are iteratively refined and ranked using the Biological Entity Expansion and Ranking Engine (BEERE), leveraging protein-protein interaction networks, functional annotations, and experimental evidence. Additionally, GETgene-AI incorporates GPT-4o, an advanced large language model, to automate literature-based ranking, reducing manual curation and increasing efficiency. In this study, we applied GETgene-AI to pancreatic cancer as a case study. The framework successfully prioritized high-priority targets such as PIK3CA and PRKCA, validated through experimental evidence and clinical relevance. Benchmarking against GEO2R and STRING demonstrated GETgene-AI's superior performance, achieving higher precision, recall, and efficiency in prioritizing actionable targets. Moreover, the framework mitigated false positives by deprioritizing genes lacking functional or clinical significance. While demonstrated on pancreatic cancer, the modular design of GETgene-AI enables scalability across diverse cancers and diseases. By integrating multi-omics datasets with advanced computational and AI-driven approaches, GETgene-AI provides a versatile and robust platform for accelerating cancer drug discovery. This framework bridges computational innovations with translational research to improve patient outcomes.",

Malic enzyme 2 (ME2) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of malate to pyruvate and has been proposed as a therapeutic target. ME2 is highly expressed in many cell types including TNBC cells. We sought to define the molecular and cellular consequences of ME2 inhibition to facilitate its clinical translation. Here, we systematically evaluated the cellular and molecular effects of ME2 knockdown (ME2kd) in multiple TNBC models. ME2kd had heterogeneous effects on proliferation, migration, and metabolic flexibility in TNBC cell lines. ME2kd MDA-MB-468 xenografts in nude mice grew significantly slower and conferred prolonged host survival. ME2kd caused distinct shifts in mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, whereas metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed altered tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux, glutamine consumption, and serine/glycine metabolism, partly through changes in malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) activity. The interplay between ME2, the serine synthesis pathway and the MAS was investigated with metabolite deprivation and co-knockdown assays. Importantly, we determined the crystal structure of ME2 bound to the small-molecule inhibitor NPD-389 and identified the binding interactions that drive the inhibitory response. These findings help to clarify the role of ME2 in TNBC phenotypes and highlight the therapeutic potential of ME2 inhibition in precision oncology.

Relapsed or refractory tumors of the central nervous system (CNS), such as atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs), are the leading cause of death in children with cancer. Claudin 6 (CLDN6)-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have demonstrated activity in preclinical and clinical studies in various solid adult cancers. However, the suitability of CLDN6 as a target in pediatric tumors and their susceptibility to CAR T-cell therapy has yet to be established. This study aimed to evaluate the suitability of CLDN6 as a target for CAR T-cell therapy of pediatric solid tumors. Immunohistochemical CLDN6 expression was assessed in fetal normal tissues (n=91), pediatric normal tissues (n=157), and two sets of pediatric tumor tissues (n=527\u2009and n=49) using a combined score that includes the percentage of stained cells with a 4-point intensity scale (0 to 3+). The antitumor activity of CLDN6 RNA-transduced CAR T cells against AT/RT cell lines was assessed with in vitro assays and in immunodeficient NOD-SCID-\u03b3c-/- (NSG) mouse models bearing orthotopic xenograft tumors. Membranous CLDN6 expression, as detected by immunohistochemistry, was widely observed in fetal tissues but was absent in almost all non-malignant pediatric tissues, except for very rare, scattered cells with 1+ to 2+ intensity in kidney, pancreas, pituitary, and salivary gland tissues. Membranous CLDN6 expression was frequently detected in a subset of the pediatric tumor entities, including germ cell tumors (93% of samples with CLDN6-positive cells), nephroblastoma (64%), extracranial malignant rhabdoid tumors (50%), and AT/RTs (39%). In CLDN6-positive samples, CLDN6 was generally expressed with 2+ or 3+ intensity in substantial proportions of the cancer cells. Strong CLDN6 expression was also detected in single samples of hepatoblastoma, Ewing sarcoma/other embryonal tumors, and osteosarcoma.In experimental models, CLDN6-CAR T cells led to antigen-specific killing of endogenously CLDN6-expressing AT/RT cell lines in vitro and exhibited potent and specific antitumor activity in mice bearing orthotopic CLDN6-expressing AT/RT xenograft tumors. These results support CLDN6 as an oncofetal cell-surface antigen that may be suitable for CAR T-cell targeting in pediatric solid tumors, including those of the CNS.",

          "abstract": "Aberrant alternative splicing (AS) contributes to cancer stemness and progression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the regulatory roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in linking AS dysregulation to tumor stemness remain elusive. We performed integrated bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq analyses combined with functional assays to identify key lncRNAs associated with splicing regulation and cancer stemness in HCC. Mechanistic studies were conducted to elucidate the molecular interplay between lncRNAs, splicing factors, and transcriptional regulators. Drug sensitivity assays were used to evaluate therapeutic potential. Global analysis revealed increased splicing regulator activity during hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression, which correlated with poor prognosis. This splicing dysregulation led us to identify 28 lncRNAs that connect aberrant splicing with cancer stemness. Among these, RAB30-DT was significantly overexpressed in malignant epithelial cells and associated with advanced tumor stage, stemness features, genomic instability, and poor patient prognosis. Functional assays demonstrated that RAB30-DT promotes proliferation, migration, invasion, colony and sphere formation in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, RAB30-DT is transcriptionally activated by CREB1 and directly binds and stabilizes the splicing kinase SRPK1, facilitating its nuclear localization. This interaction broadly reshapes the AS landscape, including splicing of the cell cycle regulator CDCA7, to drive tumor stemness and malignancy. Importantly, pharmacological disruption of the CREB1-RAB30-DT-SRPK1 axis sensitizes HCC cells to targeted therapies. Our study reveals a novel lncRNA-mediated signaling axis that integrates transcriptional regulation and splicing reprogramming to sustain cancer stemness and progression in HCC. Targeting this axis offers promising therapeutic opportunities for HCC treatment.",

Smoking is also a principal risk factor for several tumour types, including bladder cancer<sup>3</sup>. As tumourigenesis is driven by somatic mutations, we wondered whether the landscape of clones in the normal bladder differs by sex and smoking history. Using ultradeep duplex DNA sequencing (approximately 5,000\u00d7), we identified thousands of clonal driver mutations in 16 genes across 79 normal bladder samples from 45 people. Men had significantly more truncating driver mutations in RBM10, CDKN1A and ARID1A than women, despite similar levels of non-protein-affecting mutations. This result indicates stronger positive selection on driver\u00a0truncating mutations in these genes in the male urothelium. We also found activating TERT promoter mutations driving clonal expansions in the normal bladder that were associated strongly with age and smoking. These findings indicate that bladder cancer risk factors, such as sex and smoking, shape the clonal landscape of the normal urothelium. The high number of mutations identified by this approach offers a new strategy to study the functional effect of thousands of mutations in vivo-natural saturation mutagenesis-that can be extended to other human tissues.",

KMT2C and KMT2D are frequently mutated in multiple cancer types and in breast cancers mutations collectively occur at frequencies of 10-20%. However, the specificity and unique functions of the paralogues in breast cancer development are unclear. Using a combination of mutation, transcriptome, ChIP-seq, chromatin accessibility, and cell proliferation data from breast cancer patient and cell line samples we have investigated the roles of these proteins in tumour development. We identified a dependency of oestrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer cell lines on wildtype KMT2D. KMT2D ChIP-seq peaks show greater enrichment and interaction with ER and its binding partners FOXA1 and GATA3 compared to KMT2C in MCF-7 cells and uniquely bind enhancers of a set of genes enriched for oestrogen response pathways. Both KMT2C and KMT2D mutant luminal patient samples show significant downregulation of oestrogen response pathways compared to wildtype which, for KMT2C mutants, correlates with reduced chromatin accessibility around enhancers. Our results suggest that KMT2C and KMT2D have contrasting and subtype-specific roles in breast cancers and reveals KMT2D in particular as a potential target in ER\u2009+\u2009subtypes.",

          "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment in breast cancer is typically immunosuppressive. Combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy is the standard of care for high-risk, triple-negative breast cancer\u00a0patients, but it is not routinely applied to other breast cancer subtypes. Somatic mutation of STK11 (serine/threonine kinase 11), a tumor suppressor, occurs in the MSK-IMPACT platform in 1.9% of 3116 breast cases. A potential link between inactivation of STK11 and immune response regulation has been suggested in breast cancer, but the impact of STK11 suppression on tumor-immune interactions remains under investigation. In this study, we established Stk11-knockout (Stk11-KO) mouse breast cancer cell lines, performed RNA sequencing and cytokine array analysis to assess alterations in gene expression and cytokine profiles. Our results revealed significant enrichment of several immune-related pathways and a marked increase in C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (Cxcl1) expression in response to Stk11 knockout. Moreover, analysis of breast cancer patient samples showed an inverse association between the plasma CXCL1 levels and STK11 expression. To evaluate the in vivo effects of STK11 loss, we established an orthotopic breast cancer model in immunocompetent female mice. Tumors derived from Stk11-KO mouse breast cancer cells demonstrated greater tumorigenicity. In addition, mice-bearing Stk11-KO tumors exhibited elevated levels of circulating polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressive cells. In summary, STK11 suppression enhances immune-related pathways and promotes Cxcl1 expression, correlating with the expansion of immunosuppressive MDSC populations. Our findings suggest that targeting STK11-associated immunosuppressive mechanisms may provide a novel therapeutic option for STK11-deficient breast cancer patients.",

Modeling these so-called multi-omic data is especially beneficial in disease analysis, where observations across omic data types may reveal unexpected patient groupings and inform clinical outcomes and treatments. We present Multi-omic Pathway Analysis of Cells (MPAC), a computational framework that interprets multi-omic data through prior knowledge from biological pathways. MPAC leverages network relationships encoded in pathways through a factor graph to infer consensus activity levels for proteins and associated pathway entities from multi-omic data, runs permutation testing to eliminate spurious activity predictions, and groups biological samples by pathway activities to allow identifying and prioritizing proteins with potential clinical relevance, e.g. associated with patient prognosis. Using DNA copy number alteration and RNA-seq data from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas as an example, we demonstrate that MPAC predicts a patient subgroup related to immune responses not identified by analysis with either input omic data type alone. Key proteins identified via this subgroup have pathway activities related to clinical outcome as well as immune cell composition. Our MPAC R package enables similar multi-omic analyses on new datasets. The MPAC package is available at Bioconductor https://bioconductor.org/packages/MPAC.",

Previous studies have shown that the WNT (wingless type) gene family plays a role in the development of various cancers. However, comprehensive analysis of WNTs in BRCA remains largely unexplored. In this study, we examined the expression patterns, clinical relevance, and survival outcomes associated with the WNT family and identified key prognostic WNTs. We further investigated genetic alterations, DNA methylation, and drug sensitivity using cBioPortal, SMART, and GSCA databases. Data from GEO and DepMap were used for validation. Our findings revealed that while WNT2 and WNT7B were significantly upregulated and WNT11 was downregulated, WNT2 paradoxically correlated with favorable prognosis despite its oncogenic overexpression. Amplification was the most common type of alteration among the key WNTs selected for analysis and was correlated with immune infiltration and immunotherapy-related biomarkers. Functional enrichment analysis uncovered a novel connection between WNT signaling and neurodegenerative pathways. Furthermore, co-expression and drug sensitivity analyses revealed that WNTs influence the efficacy of multiple anti-cancer agents, offering potential targets for precision oncology. This study provides novel insights into the multifaceted role of WNT genes in BRCA, identifying them as promising prognostic indicators and immunotherapeutic targets that warrant further clinical exploration.",

          "abstract": "Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples suffer from the degradation of nucleic acids, a problem that becomes particularly acute with samples stored for extended periods. It remains challenging to profile FFPE using high-throughput sequencing technologies including RNA-sequencing, and the resulting FFPE RNA-seq (fRNA-seq) data has a high rate of transcript dropout, a property shared with single cell RNA-seq. Transcript counts also have high variance and are prone to extreme values, together making downstream analyses extremely challenging. We introduce the PaRaffin Embedded Formalin-FixEd Cleaning Tool (PREFFECT), a probabilistic framework for the analysis of fRNA-seq data. PREFFECT uses generative models to fit distributions to observed expression counts while adjusting for technical and biological variables. The framework can exploit multiple expression profiles generated from matched tissues for a single sample (e.g., a tumor and morphologically normal tissue) in order to stabilize profiles and impute missing counts. PREFFECT can also leverage sample-sample adjacency networks that assist graph attention mechanisms to identify the most informative correlations in the data. We evaluated the distribution of transcript counts across a compendium of fRNA-seq datasets, finding the negative binomial distribution best fits the data with little evidence supporting zero-inflated extensions. We use this knowledge in the design of PREFFECT. We show that PREFFECT can accurately impute missing values from fRNAseq count matrices and adjust for batch effects. The inclusion of sample-sample adjacency networks and multiple tissues were shown to enhance sample clustering. The vast majority of studies to date contain at most a few hundred profiles, making it challenging to correctly infer good statistical fits for each transcript especially in complex cohorts, given the noisy, incomplete and heterogeneous nature of the data. The integrative and generative approach of PREFFECT provides better and more specific model fits than generic bulk RNA-seq tools, especially when more advanced PREFFECT models provide matched profiles are included in the analysis. The transformed data can be directly used with many well-established tools for downstream analysis tasks, empowering its use in clinical biomarker studies and diagnostics.",

Recent analyses of human tumor samples and in vivo models of histological transformation have led to insights into the biology of lineage plasticity, including biomarkers predictive of high risk of transformation. However, no clinically available therapies aimed to prevent or revert plasticity are currently available.

PSMB9 plays a crucial role in antigen processing and presentation; however, its comprehensive role in orchestrating a tumor-immune landscape and regulating the anti-tumor immune responses remains unexplored. Here we investigated the context-dependent functions of PSMB9 by integrating multi-omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Genotype-Tissue Expression database, Human Protein Atlas, Tumor Immunotherapy Gene Expression Resource, and multiple other databases. Moreover, we explored the predictive value of PSMB9 in multiple immunotherapy cohorts and investigated its functional relevance in CAR-T therapy using genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screening, gene knockout cell line in vitro, and clinical cohort validation. We found widespread dysregulation in PSMB9 across cancers, predominantly upregulated in most malignancies and associated with advanced pathological stages in specific contexts. PSMB9 was also broadly and negatively correlated with tumor stemness indices. Crucially, PSMB9 expression was robustly linked to anti-tumor immunity by being significantly correlated with immune-pathway activation (e.g., IFN response, cytokine signaling), immune regulatory and immune checkpoint gene expression, and enhanced infiltration of T cells across nearly all tumor types. Consequently, elevated PSMB9 predicted superior response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in multiple cohorts, showing comparable predictive power to established predictive signatures. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 screening identified PSMB9 loss as a novel mechanism of resistance to CD19 CAR T cell therapy, with PSMB9-deficient tumor cells exhibiting a survival advantage under CAR-T pressure, supported by trends in clinical CAR-T outcomes. Our study uncovers PSMB9 as a previously unrecognized critical regulator of the tumor immune landscape in a pan-cancer scope, whose expression orchestrates key immune processes within the tumor microenvironment and serves as a potent biomarker for patient prognosis. Critically, we first established PSMB9 as a novel prognostic indicator for both checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapies, highlighting its dual role as a crucial immune modulator and a promising biomarker for guiding T cell-based immunotherapy strategies across diverse human cancers.",

          "abstract": "Metastatic melanoma is a highly aggressive disease with poor survival rates despite recent therapeutic advancements with immunotherapy. The proteomic landscape of advanced melanoma remains poorly understood, especially regarding proteomic heterogeneity across metastases within patients. We collected 83 melanoma metastases from 19 different metastatic sites in 24 patients with advanced metastatic melanoma almost exclusively from the pre-immunotherapy era, using semi-rapid autopsies. The metastases were subjected to histopathological evaluation, RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry-based proteomics for protein quantitation and non-reference peptide (NRP) sequence detection using a proteogenomic data integration approach. NRPs associated with mutations frequently occurred in proteins related to focal adhesion, vesicle-mediated transport, MAPK signalling and immune response pathways across the cohort. Intrapatient heterogeneity was negligible when considering morphology and driver gene mutation status but was substantial at the proteogenomic level. This heterogeneity was not driven by metastasis location, albeit liver metastases exhibited distinct proteogenomic patterns, including upregulation of metabolic pathways. Cluster analysis outlined four proteomic clusters (C1-4) of the metastases, characterised by the upregulation of cell cycle and RNA-splicing (C1), mitochondrial processes (C3), extracellular matrix (ECM) and immune pathways (C2) and ECM and vesicle-mediated transport pathways (C4). Around two-thirds of patients had metastases that had strongly distinct phenotypes. Patients in our cohort whose metastases were primarily assigned to clusters C1 and C3 exhibited shorter overall survival than patients whose metastases were categorised mainly into the C2 and C4 clusters. Our unique multi-metastasis cohort captured the proteogenomic heterogeneity of immunotherapy-na\u00efve melanoma distant metastases, establishing a foundation for future studies aimed at identifying novel therapeutic targets to complement current immunotherapies. Comprehensive proteogenomic profiling of post-mortem melanoma metastases, collected primarily before the immunotherapy era. Description of 1177 protein sequence variants predicted by RNA-Seq and validated via mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Empirical evidence of prominent intrapatient heterogeneity, driven by heterogeneous protein expression related to cell cycle- and mitochondrial processes, immune system and extracellular matrix organization.",

          "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are only generated during embryonic development, and their identity specification, emergence from the floor of the dorsal aorta, and proliferation are all tightly regulated by molecular mechanisms such as signaling cues. Among these, Wnt signaling is crucial for HSPC specification, differentiation, and self-renewal, requiring precise regulation for proper development and homeostasis. Wnt signaling begins when a Wnt ligand binds to cell surface receptors, such as those encoded by the frizzled gene family, activating intracellular pathways that regulate gene expression. Secreted frizzled-related proteins (Sfrps) are known to modulate Wnt signaling, acting as both agonists and antagonists. However, the in vivo roles of Sfrps in HSPC development are not fully understood. Here, we show that Sfrp1a influences zebrafish HSPC development and hematopoietic differentiation in a dose-dependent manner. Sfrp1a loss-of-function animals display an upregulation of canonical Wnt signaling, increased HSPC proliferation, and reduced differentiation into lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Conversely, low-dose overexpression of sfrp1a leads to decreased HSPC numbers and enhanced lymphoid differentiation. High-dose sfrp1a overexpression mimics the loss-of-function phenotype, with elevated canonical Wnt signaling, increased HSPCs, and decreased lymphoid and myeloid differentiation. These results emphasize the importance of dose-dependent Sfrp regulation, paralleling observations in hematopoietic cancers where SFRP1 variants can either promote or inhibit tumor development.",

The Modified Guizhi Fuling Decoction (MGFD) is used in clinical practice to treat multiple tumors. This research focused on the mechanisms of action (MOA) in MGFD that inhibit PCa. <b>Methods:</b> The impact of MGFD on PCa cells (PC3 and DU145) was examined via Cell Counting Kit-8, wound healing assays, and transwell assays. To determine the MOA, high-throughput sequencing based high-throughput screening (HTS<sup>2</sup>) was utilized along with network pharmacology. <b>Results:</b> The findings indicated that MGFD suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PCa cells. We then utilized the HTS<sup>2</sup> assay to generate 270 gene expression profiles from PCa cells perturbed by MGFD. Large-scale transcriptional analysis highlighted three pathways closely associated with PCa: the TNF signaling pathway, cellular senescence, and FoxO signaling pathway. Through the combination of network pharmacology and bioinformatics, we discovered four primary targets through which MGFD acts on PCa: AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1), Caspase-8 (CASP8), Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1 (CDK1), and Cyclin D1 (CCND1). Finally, molecular docking demonstrated that the potential bioactive compounds baicalein, quercetin, and 5-[[5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-furyl] methylene] barbituric acid strongly bind to CDK1, AKT1, and CASP8, respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> This research shows that MGFD displays encouraging anticancer effects via various mechanisms. Its multi-target activity profile underscores its promise as a potential therapeutic option for PCa treatment and encourages additional in vivo validation studies.",

This study combines computational and experimental methods to identify and validate Antrocin, a natural sesquiterpene lactone, as a potential multi-target inhibitor of the BRAF/MEK/PI3K oncogenic pathway in CRC. Differential gene expression and mutational analyses were performed using public datasets (TCGA, TNMplot, GEPIA2, GSCA, PANDA, and cBioPortal) to assess the prevalence and clinical significance of BRAF, MEK, and PI3K alterations in CRC. In silico molecular docking, using AutoDock Vina, predicted strong binding affinities of Antrocin to BRAF (\u0394G = -8.5 kcal/mol), MEK (\u0394G = -7.3 kcal/mol), and PI3K (\u0394G = -6.9 kcal/mol), comparable to those of FDA-approved inhibitors for BRAF (Dabrafenib), MEK (Trametinib), and PI3K (Alpelisib). Drug-likeness and ADME properties were evaluated via SwissADME and ADMETlab, supporting Antrocin's potential as a drug candidate. In vitro assays using HCT116 and RKO CRC cell lines validated that Antrocin treatment suppressed cell viability, spheroid formation, and migration, accompanied by reduced expression levels of the oncogenic BRAF/MEK/PI3K signaling pathway. Antrocin-treated tumor-conditioned medium experiments demonstrated Antrocin's ability to reduce the differentiation of cancer-associated fibroblasts and the polarization of M2 macrophages. Preclinical mouse xenograft experiments demonstrated a delay in tumor growth following treatment with Antrocin. These results suggest that Antrocin, identified through computational screening and validated experimentally, could be a promising multi-target agent to overcome therapy resistance in CRC.",

VUSs identified as pathogenic drivers by AI in KEAP1 and SMARCA4 are associated with worse survival, unlike \"benign\" VUSs. \"Pathogenic\" VUSs also exhibit mutual exclusivity with known oncogenic alterations at the pathway level, further suggesting biological validity.

          "abstract": "The insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1/IGF1R) pathway has been implicated in breast cancer aggressiveness; however, inhibition of this pathway has not been successful in clinical trials, indicating a lack of understanding about its role in TNBC metastasis. Recent studies have explored IGF1R involvement in integrin function and cancer cell adhesion dynamics. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that IGF1R itself regulates cancer cell adhesion. We use MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T TNBC cell lines, siRNA-mediated knockdown, and adhesion assays to assess how IGF1R and integrin knockdowns impact cancer cell adhesion. Using xCELLigence E-plates, we quantify the effect of IGF-1 ligand stimulation versus IGF1R knockdown on functional cell adhesion. We also use HUVEC human endothelial cells to determine how IGF1R regulates adhesion to the endothelium. We found that IGF-1 stimulation increased MDA-MB-231 TNBC adhesion, which was reversed by the IGF1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor BMS-754807 and the ligand-dependent receptor internalization inhibitor dansylcadaverine. Unexpectedly, IGF1R knockdown also potently stimulated cell adhesion. Concomitant \u03b21 integrin knockdown reversed the increased cell adhesion after both IGF-1 stimulation or IGF1R knockdown, indicating that the increased adhesion is \u03b21 integrin dependent. This was also seen via immunocytochemistry when cells were seeded on fibronectin. Finally, inhibiting IGF1R signaling also reduced MDA-MB-231 cell adhesion to HUVEC endothelial cells. Both IGF-1 stimulation and IGF1R knockdown in TNBC cells promote cell adhesion, which seems paradoxical. However, the commonality of both interventions is removal of IGF1R from the cell surface, since IGF-1 stimulation causes IGF1R internalization and intracellular trafficking. Blocking IGF1R signaling using a tyrosine kinase IGF1R inhibitor preserves IGF1R on the cell surface. Thus, we propose a model whereby surface-bound IGF1R inhibits \u03b21 integrin function and blocks cell adhesion. This model is supported further by our finding that treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with dansylcadaverine, which inhibits ligand-mediated receptor internalization, blocked the effect of IGF-1 on adhesion. These findings may explain why selective IGF1R receptor antagonists, which downregulate IGF1R protein upon chronic administration, were unsuccessful in the clinical setting.",

While core subunits <i>ARID1A</i> and <i>ARID1B</i> are frequently mutated in B cell malignancies, their functions remain unclear. Recent work established ARID1A-dependent functions within germinal center (GC) B cells, but its role during early B cell development, and whether its homolog, ARID1B, contributes distinct or compensatory roles at steady state or during transformation, remain unknown. Here, we used CD19-Cre-mediated deletion initiated at the pro-B cell stage to investigate their role in B cell development <i>in vivo</i>. Loss of either gene partially blocked B cell differentiation, reducing immature/recirculating B cell output, and impaired germinal center formation following antigen challenge. Combined deletion further reduced peripheral B cells, shortened survival, and resulted in aggressive leukemia. Unexpectedly, the malignancy was of myeloid origin and arose from a subset of CD19-expressing multipotent progenitors (MPPs). <i>Arid1a</i>/<i>Arid1b</i>-deficient MPPs exhibited abnormal expansion, reduced colony formation, and dysregulation of stemness and lineage-priming programs, including diminished CBFA2T3 (ETO2) and Fli1 signatures. In established B cell lymphoma cells <i>in vitro</i>, double ARID1A/ARID1B loss modestly affected cell growth, whereas loss of ARID1A increased sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition. Transcriptomic analyses revealed alterations in cell adhesion/migration pathways, cytokine-receptor interactions and DNA repair mechanisms. Collectively, these findings reveal stage-specific and compensatory roles for ARID1A and ARID1B in B cell development, uncover a mechanism by which SWI/SNF loss in MPPs redirects transformation towards myeloid leukemia, and suggest context-dependent therapeutic vulnerabilities.",

          "abstract": "Lung cancer ranks among the top causes of cancer-related deaths globally. Prompt diagnosis and timely intervention play a vital role in enhancing patient prognosis and increasing survival chances. Although C15ORF48 expression is generally elevated in tumor tissues, it is reduced in specific cancers like colorectal cancer, and its role across pan-cancer remains unclear. This research investigates the expression, immune infiltration, and predictive significance of C15ORF48 in pan-cancer using multiple databases, including TIMER2.0, GEPIA, and the Human Protein Atlas. Additionally, we use cBioPortal, PhosphoNET, and AlphaFold to analyze the distribution of genetic alterations, phosphorylation sites, and pathogenic hotspots in C15ORF48. C15ORF48 expression is generally elevated in tumor versus normal tissues, and its distribution in lung tissues is predominantly cytoplasmic. C15ORF48 expression is positively correlated with the level of expression shows a positive association with the degree of CD8\u2009+\u2009T cell infiltration.,etc. Furthermore, higher C15ORF48 expression is associated with poorer survival in lung adenocarcinoma, etc. Genetic alterations in C15orf48, including S29F, T38I, and K61N, and predicted phosphorylation sites such as S28, S29, T38, and T53, are identified across various cancers. Additionally, pathogenic hotspots, including G25D, S28K, and T38W, are highlighted. The results indicate that C15ORF48 could play a significant role in pan-cancer, particularly in lung cancer, and may serve as a potential biomarker for prognosis and targeted therapies.",

          "abstract": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a malignancy with significant morbidity and metabolic-related characteristics, necessitating the exploration of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This study focuses on monoglyceride lipase (MGLL), an important molecule identified through RNA sequencing of lipid metabolism-related genes. We investigated MGLL expression and function in ccRCC by analyzing mRNA data, clinical information, and multiple databases. We used R packages to analyze gene co-expression, immune infiltration, and m7G methylation gene correlations. We constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and performed prognostic and diagnostic receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We further validated these genes by qRT-PCR and performed functional experiments by knocking down MGLL using lentiviral vectors. Both qRT-PCR experiments and immunohistochemical data demonstrate that MGLL is upregulated in ccRCC tissues relative to normal tissues. The area under the curve (AUC) values from ROC analyses of three GEO validation datasets (GSE40435, GSE66270, and GSE213324) all exceeded 0.9. The expression of MGLL is associated with poor prognosis and correlates with gender and histological grade. Functional enrichment analysis showed that genes co-expressed with MGLL were mainly involved in proteasome-mediated protein degradation, macroautophagy, and the response to endoplasmic reticulum stress. MGLL expression is significantly positively correlated with the infiltration of neutrophils, Th17 cells, eosinophils, and dendritic cells. In contrast, it is significantly negatively correlated with cytotoxic T cells, NK CD56bright cells, and CD8 T cells. The PPI network and the correlation analysis between MGLL and m7G genes identified a total of 23 DEGs. Additionally, prognostic LASSO regression coefficients combined with ROC analysis reveal that ACLY, CALM3, NSUN2, NUDT16, NUDT4, and PKM have potential prognostic and diagnostic value. qRT-PCR experiments confirmed the expression of 13 genes from the prognostic LASSO model in ccRCC cell lines ACHN, A498, and 786-O, as well as in normal renal tubular epithelial cells HK-2. Inhibition of MGLL expression reduced ccRCC cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. This investigation elucidates the diagnostic and prognostic significance of MGLL in ccRCC, while offering mechanistic insights into its biological functions and potential therapeutic implications.",

This study aimed to investigate the biologic implications of extracellular domain shedding of phosphorylated Axl (pAxl) in lung adenocarcinoma, focusing on spread through air spaces (STAS) as a potential pathologic representation of EMT. This study included 202 patients with resected lung adenocarcinoma. A dual-domain immunohistochemistry approach using separate staining for the extracellular and intracellular domains was used to classify the tumors into shedding and nonshedding pAxl groups. Prognostic analysis was performed using recurrence-free probability (RFP) as the primary outcome. Furthermore, by using a public gene database, we developed the \"shedding pAxl score\" to experimentally investigate correlations with EMT-related genes. The shedding pAxl group exhibited significantly worse prognosis than the nonshedding pAxl group (5-year RFP, 54% and 80%, respectively; <i>p</i> < 0.001). This prognostic stratification of pAxl shedding was predominant in STAS-positive patients (5-year RFP, 37% and 75%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), but not in STAS-negative patients (5-year RFP, 73% and 84%, <i>p</i> = 0.3). Multivariate analysis revealed that pathologic stage and pAxl shedding were independent factors for recurrence (hazard ratio 2.28 [1.24-4.91], <i>p</i> = 0.008). The shedding pAxl score correlated strongly with the established EMT signature score (<i>p</i> < 0.001, R = 0.61). Shedding pAxl has a prognostic impact on lung adenocarcinoma, with a significant effect modification related to STAS. The developed shedding pAxl score, strongly associated with EMT, provides foundational knowledge for further studies on this phenomenon in lung cancer progression.",

          "abstract": "PARP inhibitors show great efficacy in BRCA1/2-mutated patients, but many preclinical studies, including combination therapies, fail to translate clinically, likely due to the limitations of preclinical models. This brief report aimed to identify appropriate cell line models to investigate PARP inhibitor sensitivity and synergies. An in silico study of cell line collections was performed to assess the correlation between BRCA1/2 mutations and sensitivity to PARP inhibitor monotherapy or with platinum-based chemotherapy. Subsequently, we characterised an isogenic model containing Brca1 and Brca2 mutations and investigated treatment response. Using cell line collections, BRCA1- and BRCA2-altered cell lines were not associated with increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. Other factors, including high PARP1 expression and low-level genome alterations, showed correlation with increased sensitivity to a PARP inhibitor. Furthermore, cell line collections did not reflect the improved\u00a0patient outcomes arising from combination PARP inhibitor and platinum-based chemotherapy. In contrast, the ID8 isogenic model, with specific Brca1 and Brca2 mutations, reflected patient tumour-like responses to PARP inhibitor monotherapy and combination therapy. This study suggests exercising caution when using cell line collections as part of model selection when investigating PARP inhibitor sensitivity and synergy. Our data propose that using an isogenic preclinical model is more likely to accurately reflect patient tumour response. However, as this study was limited to a single isogenic model, further validation in additional systems will be required to broaden the scope of these observations.",

          "abstract": "Glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle are reprogrammed in cancer cells to meet bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands, including by engagement with the extracellular matrix (ECM). However, the mechanisms by which the ECM engagement reprograms core energy metabolism is still unknown. We showed that the canonical cell-ECM adhesion protein focal adhesion kinase (FAK, also known as PTK2) and, specifically, its kinase activity, is driving cellular energetics. Using a mouse stem cell model of glioblastoma, we showed that deletion of the FAK gene simultaneously inhibits glycolysis and glutamine oxidation, increases mitochondrial fragmentation, elevates phosphorylation of the mitochondrial protein MTFR1L at serine residue 235 (S235) and triggers a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. These metabolic and structural changes arise through altered contractility of actomyosin, as shown by myosin light chain type II (MYL2, also known as MLC2) phosphorylated (p) at S19. This process can be reversed by Rho-kinase (ROCK) inhibitors revealing mechanotransduction pathway control of both mitochondrial dynamics and glutamine oxidation. FAK-dependent metabolic programming is associated with regulation of cell migration, invasive capacity and tumour growth in vivo. Our work describes a previously unrecognised FAK-ROCK axis that couples mechanical cues to the rewiring of energy metabolism, linking cell shape, mitochondrial function and malignant behaviour.",

PTEN is a lipid and protein phosphatase that contributes to various cellular processes, primarily by regulating key signaling pathways. Extensive research over the past two decades has uncovered many aspects of PTEN regulation and function and highlighted the role of PTEN in tumor suppression. PTEN loss-of-function is associated with the progression of a substantial portion of melanoma cases, and while its role in melanoma suppression is often ascribed to its inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, recent studies may hint at a more complex role for PTEN in melanoma. In this review, we provide an overview of how PTEN suppresses melanomagenesis.",

In our diagnostic practice, we observed co-occurrence of GCA with sessile serrated lesions (SSLs) and low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (LAMNs). Reviewing clinical archives, we identified 35 in-house resections of GCA, in which six (17%) harbored coincident SSLs or LAMNs. Here, we performed paired next-generation sequencing of adenocarcinomas and the coincident lesions to investigate the possibility of shared clonal relationships. For comparison, we also performed paired sequencing on three conventional appendiceal adenocarcinomas with goblet cell differentiation and coincident SSLs or LAMNs. All nine sequenced SSLs or LAMNs harbored activating KRAS mutations, two with concurrent GNAS mutations. There were no apparent shared somatic alterations between the coincident lesions and the six GCAs, the latter of which harbored alterations in other genes including ARID1A, ERBB2, RHOA, and ARHGAP35. In the three conventional adenocarcinomas, there were shared somatic alterations between the adenocarcinomas and the coincident SSLs or LAMNs, including in KRAS, SMAD4, and TP53. In contrast to conventional adenocarcinoma, GCAs do not evidently arise from KRAS-mutated precursor lesions. Based on our paired sequencing study, GCAs were clonally unrelated to coincident KRAS-mutant SSLs and LAMNs, and the reason for the relatively high prevalence of co-occurring lesions among appendectomies containing GCA remains uncertain.",

Clinical cohort analysis showed that reduced CDK12/13 expression correlates with improved survival and response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Mechanistically, CDK12/13 depletion or targeted degradation induced cytosolic nucleic acid release, triggering STING pathway activation. CDK12/13 degradation delayed tumor growth and synergized with anti-PD-1 therapy in syngeneic tumor models, enhancing STING activity and promoting CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation within tumors. Notably, the antitumor effects of this combination required STING signaling and functional CD8+ T cells. These findings establish STING activation as the key driver of T cell infiltration and the immune-hot tumor microenvironment in CDK12-mutant cancers, suggesting that dual CDK12/13 inhibitors and degraders activate antitumor immunity and potentiate responses to immunotherapies.",

While combination therapies are being increasingly investigated, such as chemotherapy with small molecule inhibitors, predicting drug response and identifying rational drug combinations based on resistance mechanisms remain major challenges. Therefore, a proteome-wide, single-gene overexpression screening platform is essential for guiding rational therapy selection. Here, we present <b>BOGO</b> (<b>B</b>xb1-landing pad human <b>O</b>RFeome-integrated system for a proteome-wide <b>G</b>ene <b>O</b>verexpression), a robust, scalable, and reproducible screening platform that enables single-copy, site-specific integration and overexpression of ~19,000 human open across cancer cell models. Using BOGO, we identified drug-specific response drivers for 16 chemotherapeutic agents and integrated clinical datasets to uncover proliferation and resistance-associated genes with prognostic potential. Drug response similarity networks revealed both shared and unique mechanisms, highlighting key pathways such as autophagy, apoptosis, and Wnt signaling, and notable resistance-associated genes including BCL2, POLD2, and TRADD. In particular, we proposed a synergistic combination of the BCL2 family inhibitor ABT-263 (Navitoclax<sup>\u00ae</sup>) and the DNA analog TAS-102 (Lonsurf<sup>\u00ae</sup>), which revealed that lysosomal modulation is a key mechanism driving DNA analog resistance. This combination therapy selectively enhanced cytotoxicity in colorectal and pancreatic cancer cells <i>in vitro</i>, and demonstrated therapeutic benefit <i>in vivo</i> in both cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Together, these findings establish BOGO as a powerful gene overexpression perturbation platform for systematically identifying chemoresistance and chemosensitization drivers, and for discovering rational combination therapies. Its scalability and reproducibility position BOGO as a broadly applicable tool for functional genomics and therapeutic discovery beyond cancer resistance.",

          "abstract": "Conventional and dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma encompass a group of malignant neoplasms that produce cartilaginous matrix and arise within or on the surface of bone. Conventional chondrosarcomas are graded on a three-tiered scale, whereas dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma is typically not graded but is considered a high-grade sarcoma and represents the most aggressive subtype with a poor prognosis. IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase-1) and IDH2 (isocitrate dehydrogenase-2) are the most commonly mutated genes in conventional and dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma, followed in frequency by COL2A1 and TP53. IDH1/2 driver mutations are also commonly found in enchondroma, considered a benign precursor lesion of chondrosarcoma, and other malignancies such as gliomas, cholangiocarcinoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. In acute myeloid leukemia, the presence of concurrent BCOR (BCL-6 corepressor) loss-of-function mutations has been linked to disease relapse and resistance to treatment with IDH inhibitors. After identifying an index case of conventional chondrosarcoma with unusually aggressive clinical evolution, we investigated the clinicopathological features of 12 cases of BCOR-mutated conventional and dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas against a control group of 15 BCOR-wildtype (WT) cases to determine whether BCOR-mutated tumors had patterns of biological progression different from tumors with intact BCOR. All identified BCOR alterations led to loss-of-function by either missense or nonsense mutations. The prevalence of BCOR mutations occurred in 5% of conventional and dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma, and these were associated with larger tumor size (p\u2009=\u20090.024), metastasis at the time of diagnosis (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001) and higher T category (3-4 vs. 1-2) (p\u2009=\u20090.009). Although larger studies are necessary to clarify the full impact of BCOR mutations on patients with conventional and dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma, our data indicate that BCOR genetic aberrations are associated with adverse clinical features.",

          "abstract": "Metastatic and relapsed osteosarcoma remains difficult to treat despite advanced surgical techniques, intensified chemotherapy, and targeted therapies. Adoptive immunotherapies such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are in their nascent stage but remain a viable therapeutic strategy for patients with aggressive solid tumors such as osteosarcoma. Folate receptor-\u03b1 (FOLR1) has been functionally implicated in osteosarcoma pathophysiology, providing rationale as a potential therapeutic target. We recently advanced a FOLR1-specific CAR T-cell product (FH FOLR1-CART) into a trial in infant acute myeloid leukemia (NCT06609928) and now evaluate this CAR construct against osteosarcoma. We provide comprehensive FOLR1 transcript and protein expression profile in patients with osteosarcoma, cell lines, and patient-derived xenografts, substantiating its significance as a therapeutic target. We further evaluate the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of FH FOLR1-CART in both standard and patient-derived osteosarcoma cell lines and xenograft models. FOLR1 transcript is expressed in the overwhelming majority of osteosarcoma primary patient specimens, osteosarcoma cell lines, and patient-derived models. FH FOLR1-CART exhibits robust in vitro activation and potent cytotoxicity against FOLR1-expressing osteosarcoma cell lines and primary osteosarcoma patient samples. More importantly, FH FOLR1-CART demonstrates potent antitumor activity in both localized and metastatic in vivo cell-derived and patient-derived xenograft models, with complete tumor eradication. These results demonstrate a potential therapeutic option for patients with advanced osteosarcoma. FH FOLR1-CART is advancing to an early-phase trial in relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and Seattle Children's Hospital. FOLR1 expression has previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of treatment-resistant osteosarcoma. This report demonstrates FOLR1 expression by most osteosarcoma tumors and provides preclinical evidence of robust antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo against xenograft osteosarcoma models exhibited by FH FOLR1-CART. These data support ongoing efforts for clinical translation of FH FOLR1-CART to an early-phase clinical trial for patients with aggressive osteosarcoma.",

          "abstract": "Immunomodulation is widely invoked to explain possible effects of anesthetic/analgesic drugs on recurrence and survival in cancer patients. By analogy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, which enhance anti-tumor actions of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), we aim to develop a precision approach to immunomodulation by anesthetic/analgesic drugs. We explore biomarkers predictive of immunotherapy response [tumor mutational burden (TMB)] and resistance [fraction genome altered (FGA)] in relation to anesthetic/analgesic dose to survival response and the expression of drug target receptor genes. Two local clinical cohorts [lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patients] were analyzed retrospectively to yield statistical interactions between drugs, outcomes, and TMB/FGA (extending previously reported results). Bulk tumor gene expression data for solid tumors from 6,488 patients across 18 solid tumor types was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and normalized by tumor type. TMB and FGA for each TCGA patient sample was extracted from cBioPortal. DeSeq was employed to quantify differential gene expression of target receptors of 79 common anesthetic/analgesic drugs for high/low TMB and FGA. Localization of these receptors to specific immune cells was estimated using CIBERSORT. Increased TMB and FGA magnified opioid pro-tumor effects on overall survival in LUAD, while increased TMB reduced ketamine anti-tumor effects on recurrence and did not affect ketorolac anti-tumor effects on recurrence. In COAD, increased TMB (DNA mismatch repair deficiency) magnified opioid anti-tumor effects on recurrence. Drug target receptor gene expression (and immune cell-type specificity) correlated with both TMB and FGA as a function of cancer type. TMB and FGA may have utility as biomarkers predictive of individual cancer patient response to anesthetic/analgesic dose effects on survival due to immunomodulation. Correlation across cancer types of anesthetic/analgesic target receptor gene expression with TMB and FGA and with TME immune cell types suggests molecular/omics level targets for further mechanistic exploration. A precision oncoanalgesia approach in the cancer patient may ultimately be warranted to optimize oncological outcomes.",

          "abstract": "The molecular circadian clock is known to be disrupted in lung adenocarcinoma, and its disruption is pro-tumorigenic in mouse models of this disease. However, the determinants of disruption of the molecular clock in human cancer are not clear. We hypothesized that derangement in expression of specific circadian clock genes or elevated MYC expression could correlate with circadian disruption in human tumors, and used Clock Correlation Distance (CCD) to compare clock order and strength in tumors based on the expression of these genes. While the expression of individual circadian genes did not consistently correlate with disruption, tumors with the highest expression of MYC or high MYC pathway activation had significantly disrupted rhythms compared to those with lower MYC. Unexpectedly, a subset of tumors with very low levels of MYC, below that found in normal lung, also showed disruption of circadian rhythms, prompting us to explore novel determinants of disruption in these tumors. We found that expression of programs associated with epithelial to mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and TGF-\u03b2 signaling were enriched in tumors with the lowest MYC expression, and that, surprisingly, those tumors with a mesenchymal expression pattern had more ordered (stronger) rhythms. To directly test this correlation between cell state and rhythms, we exposed lung adenocarcinoma cells to TGF- \u03b2 to induce EMT. TGF- \u03b2 induced a quasi-mesenchymal phenotype and caused a significant increase in the amplitude of oscillations in these cells. Together, our data show that MYC expression, pathway activation, and a mesenchymal cell state are both independent determinants of circadian status in lung adenocarcinoma.",

Whole-genome CRISPR-knockout library screening methods have facilitated this goal. Pooled libraries of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting over 90% of the annotated protein coding genome are used to induce gene knockouts in pre-clinical cancer models. Novel genes of interest are identified by evaluating sgRNA dropout or enrichment following selection pressure application. This method is particularly beneficial for researching cancers where effective treatment strategies are limited. One example of a commonly chemoresistant cancer, particularly at relapse, is the low survival malignancy epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), made up of multiple histotypes with distinct molecular profiles. CRISPR-knockout library screens in pre-clinical EOC models have demonstrated the ability to predict biomarkers of treatment response, identify targets synergistic with standard-of-care chemotherapy, and determine novel actionable targets which are synthetic lethal with cancer-associated mutations. Robust experimental design of CRISPR-knockout library screens, including the selection of strong pre-clinical cell line models, allows for meaningful conclusions to be made. We discuss essential design criteria for the use of CRISPR-knockout library screens to discover genetic dependencies in cancer and draw attention to discoveries with translational potential for EOC.",

          "abstract": "FOXA1 is a pioneer transcription factor essential for chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation in hormone-driven cancers. In breast cancer, FOXA1 plays a central role in facilitating nuclear receptor binding, reprogramming enhancer landscapes, and promoting transcriptional changes associated with therapy resistance. Whereas FOXA1's function has been primarily studied in the context of estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER), its broader protein interaction network remains incompletely defined. In this study, we systematically map FOXA1-interacting proteins in ER-positive breast cancer cells using proximity-dependent biotin labeling (miniTurbo) combined with quantitative LC-MS/MS proteomics. We engineered MCF-7 cell lines stably expressing miniTurbo-tagged FOXA1 at either the N-terminus or C-terminus to ensure comprehensive coverage of interaction interfaces. This approach recovered known FOXA1 partners, including AR, MLL3, YAP1, and GATA3, and identified 157 previously unreported FOXA1 interactors. Notably, 42 of these novel partners, including NR2C2, were significantly associated with poor relapse-free survival in patients with ER-positive breast cancer. To demonstrate the utility of this resource, we characterized the FOXA1-NR2C2 interaction in depth. Integrating chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing, we show that FOXA1 and NR2C2 co-occupy a subset of genomic regions and drive co-regulated transcriptional programs involved in tumor progression. Our study reveals an expanded FOXA1 interactome and new insights into its functional network in breast cancer, providing candidate proteins for further exploration as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These findings expand the FOXA1 interactome in breast cancer and uncover new candidate proteins with potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in hormone-driven tumors.",

By analyzing gene expression profiles and miRNA interactions, the goal is to identify key regulatory miRNAs and signaling pathways that differentiate these tumor types and could serve as important regulators for therapy development. Raw data for seminomas and teratomas were extracted from the GEO database, and gene hubs were identified using STRING and Gephi. Signaling pathways and functional annotations were analyzed using miRPathDB, while miRNA-gene interactions were explored via miRWalk. Hub miRNAs were filtered and confirmed using miRDB. This study highlights significant changes in gene expression diversity between tumor and normal gonadal tissues, providing insights into the molecular dynamics of seminomas and teratomas. Distinctions between seminomas and teratomas were identified, shifting the focus toward miRNAs to discover more precise and novel therapeutic approaches. The hub genes of seminomas and teratomas were identified separately. MiRNAs targeting these hub genes were also determined and confirmed. These miRNAs collectively influence essential oncogenic pathways-confirming hsa-miR-138-5p as a regulator of pathways such as Hippo signaling, transcriptional misregulation in cancer, and microRNA cancer signaling in seminomas, and hsa-miR-200b-3p as a regulator of p53 signaling, T cell receptor signaling, and pathways including PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin in teratomas-confirming their potential as promising candidates for subtype-specific therapeutic intervention. MiRNAs identified through bioinformatics analyses, and their predicted regulatory roles in key oncogenic pathways, represent potential therapeutic targets or regulators of biological processes.

Tumour genetic variations differed in mutation burden, copy number alterations, and microsatellite instability. Drug sensitivities, including those of navitoclax and CCT036477, showed an association with GOT1 expression.

Ferroptosis is characterized by iron-mediated lipid peroxidation of cell membranes and is critically regulated by the cystine/glutamate antiporter system (SLC7A11) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Our study aimed to investigate the relationship between ERBB3 and ferroptosis in gastric cancer. We found that high ERBB3 expression correlated with resistance to ferroptosis-inducing agents, including GPX4 and SLC7A11 inhibitors, across multiple cell lines. Vice versa, ERBB3 inhibition with TX1-85-1 induced lipid peroxidation in gastric cancer cells, with effects most pronounced in cell lines expressing higher SLC7A11 levels. Knockdown of ERBB3 reproduced these effects, suggesting SLC7A11 as a predictive marker. Importantly, combined inhibition of ERBB3 and GPX4 significantly enhanced lipid peroxidation and cytotoxicity, while ERBB3 activation by co-treatment with the ERBB3 ligand heregulin reduced lipid peroxidation in cells with lower baseline SLC7A11 expression. Analysis of glutathione levels and SLC7A11 expression further supported the role of ERBB3 in modulating ferroptosis sensitivity. These findings identify ERBB3 as a critical regulator of ferroptosis and a promising target for enhancing ferroptosis-mediated cell death. Its inhibition in combination with ferroptosis inducers may thus represent a particularly promising and efficacious therapeutic strategy in gastric cancer.",

          "abstract": "Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a chemokine involved in inflammation and primary immune response, playing a key role in recruiting neutrophils. IL-8 is produced by several cell types, including immune cells and certain cancer cells. Elevated levels of IL-8 have been associated with a poorer outcome in several tumors and have been related to advanced diseases, treatment resistance, and possibly promoting neo angiogenesis and immune cell recruitment. In the renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the prognostic role of IL-8 has not been settled. From January 1, 2008 to June 18, 2024, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched for all studies investigating the potential prognostic role of IL-8 in RCC. All studies were rated according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed as clinical outcomes, and a meta-analysis was performed for both. Overall, six papers met the predefined inclusion criteria, with final analyses demonstrating that high IL-8 levels significantly correlate with worse prognosis in RCC, with a statistically shorter PFS (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.59; P\u2009=\u20090.037) and statistically shorter OS (HR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.21-2.84; P\u2009=\u2009.001). Prospective randomized clinical trials are also necessary to investigate the predictive role of IL-8 in the contemporary treatment scenario of RCC to improve clinical decision-making. This meta-analysis demonstrates the significant prognostic role of IL-8 in RCC, suggesting that IL-8 could be used to refine the prognostic RCC assessment.",

In this study, 33 missense VUSs in <i>TP53</i> reported in the gnomAD database were analyzed using in silico tools, including PhosphositePlus v6.7.4, the Kinase Library v0.0.11, and Dynamut2. Of these analyzed variants, five disrupted known phosphorylation sites, while another five created new consensus sequences for phosphorylation. Moreover, 20 variants exhibited a moderate destabilizing effect on the protein structure. At least three missense VUSs were identified as potentially affecting p53 function, which may contribute to cancer development. These findings highlight the importance of integrating in silico structural and functional analysis to assess the pathogenic potential of missense VUSs.",

Certain POLe frameshift mutations that affect the proofreading domain are purified in cancer cells, but point mutations in other domains have also been reported. Here we use an artificial intelligence algorithm to determine what other mutations co-occur with POLe mutations in colorectal cancers. We partitioned POLe mutations into driver, passenger, and WT (no mutation), then assessed mutations in other genes in these three groups. We found that a driver POLe mutation is not likely to associate with driver mutations in other genes. Thus, driver mutations in colorectal cancers appear to purify in a manner that is independent of POLe. Mutations that affect POLe function do not necessarily increase the frequency of driver mutations in other genes. Structural analysis shows that many POLe driver mutations affect coordination of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion in the active site.

Based on emerging evidence highlighting the critical role of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in tumor proliferation and invasion, this study leveraged multiple ccRCC cohorts to employ Mendelian randomization (MR) and ultimately developed a novel Bidirectional Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation-associated Index (B-LLPSI) using LASSO regression, aiming to predict patient prognosis and therapeutic response. Notably, B-LLPSI demonstrates substantial potential as a universal prognostic indicator across multiple cancer types, underpinning its prospective application in individualized oncology. Paradoxically, while high B-LLPSI levels correlate with poorer patient prognosis, they simultaneously predict enhanced responsiveness to immunotherapy. Furthermore, the B-LLPSI signature was found to be upregulated in tumor tissues and capable of promoting tumor proliferation and invasion. In summary, B-LLPSI holds promise as a robust and independent prognostic tool for diverse cancers, providing critical insights for formulating individualized treatment strategies.",

Although homologous recombination (HR) deficiency and retinoblastoma gene (RB1) expression have been implicated in prognosis, their combined role in shaping tumor biology and survival outcomes is not well defined. To investigate the relationship between HR status and RB1 expression and explore their potential as a combined prognostic marker, we analyzed data from two cohorts: (1) 272 HGSOC cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with RB1 mRNA expression data and HR status previously annotated by Takaya et al. (HR-deficient, HRD; HR-proficient, HRP), and (2) 226 clinical HGSOC cases profiled by comprehensive genomic and immune profiling (CGIP) at OmniSeq, categorized as either HR-intact (HRi) or harboring BRCA1/2 alterations (BRCAa). Cases were additionally stratified according to RB1 mRNA expression level as RB1-high (>\u200925th percentile; RBH) or RB1-low (\u2264\u200925th percentile; RBL). HRP-RBH tumors (n\u2009=\u2009120, 44.1%) were associated with significantly worse overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) compared to all other subgroups. Survival metrics were evaluated from the TCGA cohort and demonstrated that median OS for HRP-RBH was 35.9 mo, shorter than HRP-RBL (52.0 mo), HRD-RBL (57.1 mo), and HRD-RBH subgroups (53.3 mo; all p\u2009<\u20090.0001). PFS demonstrated a similar trend (15.1 mo vs. 20.6, 20.2 and 20.4 mo, respectively, p\u2009=\u20090.0021). HRP-RBH tumors also showed higher aneuploidy scores (median 18 vs.\u2009\u2264\u200910.5 in other subgroups, all p\u2009<\u20090.01). From the OmniSeq cohort, HRi-RBH tumors exhibited a distinct immune gene signature, including elevated mRNA expression of 213 differentially expressed genes and enrichment of pathways such as EMT, PI3K/AKT signaling, and interleukin signaling. Overall, this study suggests that molecular subtyping of HGSOC based on HR status and RB1 expression may provide valuable prognostic insight. HRP tumors with high RB1 expression represent a high-risk subgroup with a distinct molecular profile and poor clinical outcomes, underscoring the need for novel therapeutic strategies targeting this aggressive subset. These findings provide a foundation for future studies aimed at developing biomarkers and treatments tailored to this challenging subset of HGSOC patients.",

Radiation-induced extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling and fibrosis can induce tumour resistance and recurrence, but have not been studied in MIBC. Here, we aimed to characterise the impact of radiation on the ECM composition of MIBC. Three MIBC cell lines (T24, UMUC3, J82) were treated with fractionated radiation. We used proteomics to analyse the ECM composition produced by surviving cancer cells and immunofluorescence to investigate changes in the morphology and number of ECM fibres. We evaluated the RNA expression of identified ECM proteins (FN1, COL5A1, COL1A1, TNF6AIP6, FLG) in one cystectomy (TCGA-BLCA, n=397) and two radiotherapy (BC2001, n=313; BCON, n=151) cohorts. There were 613 proteins affected by radiation (p<sub>adj</sub><0.05, fold change >2 or <-2), 68 of which were ECM-associated proteins. There was a general increase in proteases and protease regulators but heterogeneity across cell lines. Enrichment analysis showed ECM organisation was the primary pathway affected. Immunofluorescence confirmed radiation affected ECM structure, generally, reducing the number, length and width of fibres. Five ECM genes of interest were identified (<i>COL1A1</i>, <i>COL5A2</i>, <i>FN1</i>, <i>FLG</i>, <i>TNFAIP6</i>), constituting an ECM signature. High <i>FN1</i>, <i>COL1A1, TNF6AIP6</i> mRNA levels and ECM signature scores were independent poor prognostic markers, while <i>FLG</i> mRNA expression independently predicted radiotherapy benefit in a meta-analysis (n=861). We found high <i>COL1A1</i> expression levels predicted hypoxia-modifying treatment benefit. Prognostic significance of <i>COL5A2</i>, <i>FN1</i> and the ECM signature was dependent on patients harbouring <i>TP53</i>-mutations. Radiation alters the composition and structure of the ECM produced by MIBC. As a proof-of-concept, we showed that radiation-affected ECM genes are independent prognostic and predictive markers of radiotherapy benefit in MIBC. Future studies should validate these radiation-induced ECM changes in clinical samples, and explore the role of <i>FLG</i> in radioresistance.",

Previous work has shown that the PIWI pathway is crucial for TE suppression in the germline. However, the status and function of this pathway is not well characterized in differentiated somatic cells and there is a lack of consensus on the role of the pathway in somatic tumorigenesis. To shed light on this conundrum, we examined the PIWI pathway in colon cancer through combining bioinformatic analyses and cell-based assays. Shifted weighted annotation network (SWAN) analysis revealed that the pathway experiences significant allelic losses in colon cancer and that PIWIL2, the main catalytic component of the pathway responsible for TE silencing, experiences the highest percent deletions. PIWIL2 is downregulated in colon tumors of advanced stage, nodal metastasis, and in certain subtypes, correlating with poor survival, while it is also downregulated in ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease that predisposes to colon cancer. PIWIL2 depletion in colon epithelial Caco2 cells leads to increased anchorage-independent growth, decreased levels of TE-targeting non-canonical piRNAs, increased LINE-1 levels and activity, and in DNA damage, altogether highlighting a tumor-suppressing role of PIWIL2 in the colon.",

The recently developed pan-KRAS inhibitor daraxonrasib, also known as RMC-6236, is capable of targeting a wide array of KRAS mutations and shows promise against pancreatic and lung cancers. However, the efficacy and mechanisms of action of daraxonrasib in osteosarcoma (OS) remain unclear. We evaluated the effects of daraxonrasib on the viability, proliferation, and metastatic potential of wild-type and KRAS mutant OS cells. We assayed the effects of treatment on downstream targets using qPCR, immunoblotting, and activity assays to explore the underlying mechanism by which daraxonrasib selectively suppresses the metastatic potential of KRAS mutant osteosarcoma. Finally, we investigated how the increased prevalence of GTP-bound KRAS enhanced the sensitivity of KRAS wild-type osteosarcoma cells to daraxonrasib using siRNA targeting RASA1. Daraxonrasib selectively attenuated the proliferation and migratory ability of KRAS mutant HOS-143B cells without affecting KRAS wild-type controls. Additionally, daraxonrasib suppressed the expression of the matrix metalloproteases MMP9 and MMP1, which promote cell motility and metastasis. Daraxonrasib selectively inhibited the AKT/ETS1 pathway in HOS-143B cells, whereas no such effect was observed in HOS cells. HOS cells were sensitized to daraxonrasib by knocking down the GTPase-activating protein RASA1. In osteosarcoma, KRAS inhibition decreased MMP1, MMP9, and AKT/ETS1 signaling. Daraxonrasib is a promising agent for treating osteosarcoma with KRAS mutations.",

          "abstract": "Integrin subunit alpha V (ITGAV), a subunit of the integrin receptor, is involved in many types of cancers. In order to explore the potential mechanisms of ITGAV in cancers, we carried out a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis using public database. In this study, ITGAV expression in different cancers and the relationship between ITGAV and clinic-pathological features, prognosis, genetic alteration, epigenetic modification, and tumor immune microenvironment were systemically analyzed. Gene enrichment analysis was performed to explore potential functions of ITGAV in gastric cancer (GC). GC tissue microarrays and in vitro cell experiments were used to verify the prediction results in GC. The results revealed that ITGAV was variably expression in different cancers, and ITGAV had a certain prognostic and diagnostic value in most cancers, including GC. ITGAV expression was found to be related to genetic alteration, DNA methylation, immune checkpoint gene, and immune cell infiltration in multiple cancers. Functional analyses revealed that ITGAV was involved in the regulation of EMC remodeling, ferroptosis, and cuproptosis in GC. In vitro experiments verified that ITGAV was correlated with GC cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Our study demonstrated that ITGAV can be used as an effective prognostic and immunological biomarker for multiple cancers. ITGAV can promote GC malignant progression and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for GC treatment.",

          "abstract": "DFMO has been studied as a cancer therapeutic at doses ranging from 500 to 9,000 mg/m2/day. Lower doses are favored for cancer prevention studies while higher doses, often with chemotherapy, are studied in refractory cancers. DFMO inhibits the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), an oncogene transcriptionally regulated by MYC. MYC genes are the principal oncogenic drivers of neuroblastoma, and ODC1 is co-amplified in a subset with dismal outcome, so DFMO is a rational therapeutic candidate. Low-dose DFMO has now been FDA-approved for high-risk patients though the mechanisms for its anti-tumor activity, and the exposures required to elicit them, remain obscure. We sought to define biomarkers of activity across exposures achieved in the clinic with low through high-dose DFMO. Polyamines support protein translation by providing spermidine, which is essential to hypusinate (and activate) the elongation factor, eIF5A. Selective binding of polyamines with tRNA and rRNA provide eIF5A-independent mechanisms of translation support. We show that low-dose DFMO does not extend survival in mouse models in vivo nor alter translation biomarkers in vitro. High-dose DFMO consistently extends survival in neuroblastoma models, and, in a subset of neuroblastoma cell lines, inhibits eIF5A hypusination and global translation at achievable concentrations. However, the concentration required to engage these changes across many cell lines exceeded that achievable even with high-dose DFMO. No correlation was seen among MYCN and/or ODC1 copy number and sensitivity to DFMO. Combining high-dose DFMO with additional agents to further deplete tumor polyamines may be necessary to fully engage polyamine-depletion effects on tumors, and more granular measures of translation, including codon-resolution ribosome profiling, may be required to define these effects.",

Calcium/Calmodulin signaling pathway has been implicated to the initiation and progression of diverse human cancers. Loss or downregulation of Purkinje cell protein 4 (PCP4), is frequently observed in some prostate cancer patients, particularly those with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Public datasets were used to analyze PCP4 expression and the relationship between PCP4 expression and clinicopathological characteristics of PCa patients. Gain- and loss-of-function studies in PCa cell lines and mouse models were performed to characterize the role of PCP4 in tumor progression. A series of molecular and biochemical experiments were carried out in PCa cell lines to investigate the mechanism underlying PCP4-mediated tumor suppression. (1) <i>PCP4</i> gene loss occurs at high frequency in PCa patients, and decreased expression of PCP4 correlates with poor prognosis of PCa, particularly CRPC development; (2) <i>TMPRSS2-ERG</i> fusion frequently co-occurs with <i>PCP</i>4 deletion; (3) PCP4 suppresses prostate cancer progression <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>; (4) PCP4 is an androgen receptor (AR) suppressed gene; (5) PCP4 was involved in the stabilization of CAMKK2 protein; (6) PCP4 inhibits PCa progression by regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CAMKK2/AMPK/AR signaling axis. Our findings elucidate the molecular mechanism that PCP4 downregulation promotes PCa progression via Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CAMKK2/AMPK/AR pathway, highlighting its significance in CRPC development.",

This review comprehensively summarises the role of PHF20L1 in various cancers, including breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers, as well as retinoblastomas, and elucidates its molecular mechanisms of action in cancer pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence indicates that PHF20L1 is upregulated in these malignancies and drives tumour progression by promoting proliferation, metastasis, and immune evasion. Furthermore, PHF20L1 orchestrates tumour-related gene expression by interacting with key epigenetic complexes. Given its unique structural features, we propose novel strategies for developing small-molecule inhibitors and combinatorial therapies, providing a theoretical basis for targeted epigenetic regulation for precision treatment. Future research should further investigate the molecular regulatory networks of PHF20L1 in different cancers and other human diseases and focus on developing specific small-molecule inhibitors to enable precision-targeted therapies.",

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has revolutionized our ability to dissect the cellular complexity of cancers, which is often obscured in conventional bulk transcriptomic experiments. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, we performed an integrative analysis of scRNA-seq data from multiple LUAD patient cohorts to investigate cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes across disease stages. Clustering, lineage trajectory analysis, and transcriptional regulatory network reconstruction were employed to identify stage-specific gene markers and their upstream regulators. Additionally, we constructed intercellular communication networks to evaluate signaling changes within the tumor microenvironment (TME) during LUAD progression. <b>Results:</b> Our analysis revealed that epithelial cells from stage IV tumors exhibited a distinct transcriptional profile compared to earlier stages, a separation not observed in immune or stromal cell populations. We identified a panel of gene markers that differentiated epithelial cells across disease stages and effectively stratified patients into subgroups with distinct survival outcomes and TME compositions. Regulatory network analysis uncovered key transcription factors, including ATF3, ATF4, HSF1, KLF4, and NFIC, as potential upstream regulators of these stage-specific genes. Moreover, cell-cell communication analysis revealed a significant increase in signaling originating from epithelial cells and a concomitant decrease in immune-derived signals in late-stage LUAD. We identified several signaling pathways enriched in stage-specific crosstalk, including Wnt, PTN, and PDGF pathways, which may play critical roles in LUAD progression. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study provides a comprehensive single-cell resolution map of LUAD progression, highlighting epithelial-driven regulatory programs and dynamic intercellular communication within the TME. Our findings uncover novel molecular markers and regulatory mechanisms with potential prognostic and therapeutic value for more precise treatment.",

Patients often develop resistance to next-generation hormonal therapies that target the androgen receptor (AR) axis (e.g., abiraterone and enzalutamide). A splice variant of AR, AR-V7, is associated with resistance to these inhibitors as well as mCRPC progression and poor prognoses. We embarked upon a high-throughput screen to identify synergistic combinations of targeted therapies using two CRPC cell lines, LNCaP95 and VCaP-CR. Combinations targeting BCL2L1 (Bcl-xL) (A-1331852 and navitoclax) and MCL1 (S63845) synergistically decreased cell viability and induced apoptotic activity via cleavage of PARP, caspase 3, and caspase 7 across AR-V7-expressing CRPC cell lines (LNCaP95, VCaP-CR, and 22Rv1) and a patient-derived organoid model (LuCaP 167CR). We also explored the use of a Bcl-xL-specific proteolysis-targeting chimera degrader (PROTAC) to minimize platelet toxicity associated with Bcl-xL inhibitors. We showed similar synergistic efficacy with the Bcl-xL-targeting PROTAC in combination with S63845 in the three-dimensional spheroid models. Our findings support further preclinical development of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 inhibitors for mCRPC. Using an unbiased, combinatorial, high-throughput drug screen, we identified the combination of co-targeting Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 to be highly synergistic across AR-V7-expressing CRPC models. We showed efficacy in higher-order models through validation across in vitro models spanning two-dimensional cell culture, three-dimensional cell culture, and a patient-derived organoid model.

To address these challenges, efforts to classify variants are increasingly using multiplexed assays of variant effect (MAVEs), which are massively scaled experiments that can generate functional data for thousands of variants simultaneously. The rise of MAVEs is accompanied by better guidance on the use of MAVE data for classifying germline variants to aid their clinical implementation.

          "abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality globally. Proliferating cells, crucial components of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), play a significant role in cancer progression and immunotherapy response. Herein, we utilized multi-omics data and employed a multifaceted approach to delineate the proliferating cell landscape in LUAD. The Scissor algorithm was applied to identify Scissor+ proliferating cell genes associated with prognosis. An integrative machine learning program, comprising 111 algorithms, was developed to construct a Scissor+ proliferating cell risk score (SPRS). The SPRS model demonstrated superior performance in predicting prognosis and clinical outcomes compared to 30 previously published models. The role of SPRS and five pivotal genes in immunotherapy response was evaluated, and their expression was experimentally verified. Multifactorial analysis confirmed SPRS as an independent prognostic factor affecting LUAD patient survival. High- and low-SPRS groups exhibited different biological functions and immune cell infiltration in the TIME. High SPRS patients showed resistance to immunotherapy but increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic and targeted therapeutic agents. Our study elucidates the dynamics of proliferating cells in LUAD, enhancing prognostic accuracy and highlighting the potential of SPRS and its constituent genes for personalized therapeutic interventions.",

          "abstract": "Somatic mutations commonly accumulate in histologically normal tissues and contribute to cancer development. However, many somatic variants found at high frequencies in normal tissues are also found at high frequencies in cancers arising from the same tissue types. Consequently, the roles of these variants in cancer development remain poorly understood. To address this, we assessed the selective pressures across steps of tumorigenesis, as well as epistasis between driver mutations. We employed evolutionary modeling to quantify the strength of selection on somatic variants across two key steps of esophageal development: from organogenesis to clonal histologically normal epithelium, and from there to esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma. Analyzing sequence data from 2171 samples, our first-of-its kind model revealed the stepwise contributions of somatic mutations to increased cellular division and survival and their pairwise epistatic effects on driver mutation selection. <i>NOTCH1</i> substitutions were strongly selected along the step from organogenesis to clonal histologically normal esophageal tissue, explaining their high prevalence in samples of this tissue. However, for the first time, we show that there is little to no positive selection for <i>NOTCH1, NOTCH2,</i> and <i>FAT1</i> mutations during progression from clonal histologically normal esophageal tissue to esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma in humans, leading to a conclusion that these substitutions promote clonal growth in normal tissue, but do not drive tumorigenesis from extant clonal tissue growths. Moreover, we provide a somatic genetic basis for this differential role: we demonstrate for the first time that mutations in <i>NOTCH1</i> exhibit antagonistic epistasis with mutations of well-known tumor suppressor genes <i>TP53</i> and <i>RB1</i>, reducing selection for these progressive mutations in tumorigenesis. Our findings demonstrate that early positively selected mutations in <i>NOTCH1</i> and other genes can shape evolutionary trajectories in ways that ultimately constrain malignant progression. Quantification of step-specific selection and identification of antagonistic epistatic interactions with key tumor suppressors reveals that somatic evolution is often context-dependent-what promotes clonal expansion in normal tissue may later impede growth or survival in tumors. These insights underscore the need for precision strategies that account for the shifting fitness landscape across premalignant and malignant stages, informing early detection, prevention, and therapeutic prioritization.",

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor. Its poor prognosis is primarily due to recurrence and resistance to standard therapies, such as temozolomide (TMZ). Emerging evidence suggests that neuronal excitation within the tumor microenvironment contributes to the progression and chemoresistance of GBM. This study identifies prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as a key regulator of neuronal activity that promotes tumor resistance. It is demonstrated that PGE2 activates neurons via the prostaglandin E1 (EP1) receptor, leading to intracellular calcium influx and phosphorylation of calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which enhances synaptic plasticity. Neuronal excitation results in upregulation of synaptic proteins and neurotransmitter alterations, notably increasing glutamine and asparagine levels, which correlate with heightened chemoresistance. Co-culture experiments confirmed that PGE2-stimulated neurons induce resistance in adjacent GBM cells, highlighting a neuron-tumor interaction that facilitates recurrence. To overcome this resistance mechanism, compound 11 is developed, a novel blood-brain barrier (BBB)-permeable celecoxib derivative that effectively inhibits PGE2 signaling. Treatment with compound 11 significantly reduces GBM growth, impairs neuronal excitation, and improves survival outcomes in preclinical models. These findings underscore PGE2-induced neuronal excitation as a critical driver of drug resistance in GBM, and implicate compound 11 as a promising therapeutic agent to counteract PGE2-driven tumor recurrence.",

          "abstract": "<i>Myeloid Zinc Finger 1</i> (<i>MZF1</i>) is a zinc finger transcription factor gene that regulates gene expression by recognizing and binding to specific DNA sequences. Preliminary studies have suggested that <i>MZF1</i> plays a pivotal role in the invasion and metastasis of various solid cancers. However, its role within the tumor immune microenvironment, as well as its prognostic value and potential for predicting responses to immunotherapy across different cancer types, remains inadequately explored and warrants a comprehensive systematic analysis. <i>MZF1</i> expression levels in various cancers were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The TISCH web tool analyzed <i>MZF1</i> expression in 32 cell types. A spatial distribution map of <i>MZF1</i> related to cancer tissue markers was created using the STOmics DB. A univariate Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate <i>MZF1</i>'s prognostic value. The cBioPortal database helped explore potential <i>MZF1</i> mutations across cancer types. The TIMER2.0 database was used to study the relationship between <i>MZF1</i> expression and immune cell infiltration. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) were performed to elucidate signaling pathways modulated by <i>MZF1</i>. Drug sensitivity testing for <i>MZF1</i> was done using the CellMiner, the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP), and the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) databases. Finally, <i>MZF1</i> knockdown was achieved with siRNA silencing. Changes in <i>MZF1</i> expression are linked to the prognosis of most cancer patients. In the tumor microenvironment, <i>MZF1</i> is mainly found in CD4 Tconv cells and monocytes/macrophages. Studies show that <i>MZF1</i> is associated with cancer immunotherapy markers, immune cell infiltration, and immune modulators. Additionally, its role in immune regulation was confirmed through analysis of StromalScore, ImmuneScore, ESTIMATE, and immune infiltration. Molecular docking identified <i>MZF1</i>-targeted drugs, with validated effects on breast cancer and gastric cancer cell survival and migration <i>in vitro</i>. Lastly, the knockdown of <i>MZF1</i> can suppress cancer cell migration. Collectively, these findings underscore the pivotal role of <i>MZF1</i> in tumor biology and immune modulation. <i>MZF1</i> emerges as a promising prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target, offering novel avenues for cancer treatment strategies.",

          "abstract": "Currently, there is no standard treatment for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) that is free of side effects and resistance. Additionally, limited information exists on how curcumin affects the gene expression profiles of patients with translocation renal cell carcinoma (tRCC) and papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC). The pathways responsible for metastasis in tRCC are still not well understood, and there is no established treatment or reliable biomarker to predict outcomes for metastatic tRCC. Primary clinical data from patients were retrieved from the TCGA database and analyzed using cBioPortal, stitch, string, R and Python. Various analyses were performed, including differential gene expression, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, drug-targeted gene analysis, gene ontology (GO), enrichment analyses, and systematic searches to assess the impact of curcumin on the transcriptomic profiles of tRCC, pRCC, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). No significant impact of sensitive genes on survival in KIRC and KIRP was found, though a trend suggested they may delay disease progression. The combination of curcumin with sunitinib showed promise in overcoming drug resistance in ccRCC by inducing ferroptosis, reducing iron, and increasing ADAMTS18 expression. This study, leveraging data from the TCGA database and other databases explored the impact of curcumin on transcriptomic profiles in tRCC, pRCC, and clear cell RCC (ccRCC). Gene analysis revealed immune and metabolic differences, with KIRC showing a stronger immune response. This study is the first to propose that future research into the miR-148/ADAMTS18 genes and the ferroptosis pathway in tRCC and pRCC could lead to the development of new therapies and the identification of novel therapeutic targets, potentially overcoming drug resistance and metastasis.",

Sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor targeting the RAF pathway and is FDA-approved for several cancers, yet its efficacy in lung cancer is controversial. Previous clinical research showed that a <i>ARAF</i> p.S214C mutation exhibited exceptional responsiveness to sorafenib in lung adenocarcinoma. <b>Methods</b>: Considering this promising clinical potential, the oncogenic potential and sorafenib response of the <i>ARAF</i> p.S214C mutation were investigated using lung cancer models. <i>ARAF</i> p.S214C mutant, <i>ARAF</i> wild-type (WT), and <i>EGFP</i> control genes were ectopically expressed in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines retroviral transduction. In vitro and in vivo sorafenib sensitivity studies were performed, followed by transcriptomics and proteomics analyses. <b>Results</b>: Compared to the <i>ARAF</i>-WT and <i>EGFP</i>-engineered cells, the <i>ARAF</i> p.S214C-engineered cells activated Raf-MEK-ERK signaling and exhibited enhanced oncogenic potential in terms of in vitro cell proliferation, colony and spheroid formation, migration, and invasion abilities, as well as in vivo tumorigenicity. The <i>ARAF</i> p.S214C-engineered cells also displayed heightened sensitivity to sorafenib in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing and reverse-phase protein array analyses demonstrated elevated expression of genes and proteins associated with tumor aggressiveness in the <i>ARAF</i> p.S214C mutants, and its sorafenib sensitivity was likely moderated through inhibition of the cell cycle and DNA replication. The ERK and PI3K signaling pathways were also significantly deregulated in the <i>ARAF</i> p.S214C mutants regardless of sorafenib treatment. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study demonstrates the oncogenicity and sorafenib sensitivity of the <i>ARAF</i> p.S214C mutation in lung cancer cells, which may serve as a biomarker for predicting the sorafenib response in lung cancer patients. Importantly, investigating the gene-drug sensitivity pairs in clinically exceptional responders may guide and accelerate personalized cancer therapies based on specific tumor mutations.",

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can encode microproteins that play key roles in cancer. LncRNA ASH1L-AS1 has coding potential, but its role in HCC remains unclear. Clarifying its role in MAPK signaling may uncover novel therapeutic targets for HCC. Translatable lncRNAs associated with HCC were identified by integrating data from the TCGA-LIHC cohort and the TransLnc database. The functional role of ASH1L-AS1 and its encoded microprotein APPLE was explored through in vitro and in vivo assays, such as CCK-8, EdU incorporation, wound healing, Transwell migration and invasion, and xenograft tumor models. Mechanistic investigations were conducted to elucidate molecular mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic strategies, including co-immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, ChIP-qPCR, luciferase reporter assays, truncation mutation analysis, immunofluorescence, Western blot, RNA sequencing, drug sensitivity analysis etc. RESULTS: A total of 696 translatable lncRNAs associated with HCC were identified, with their encoded products exhibiting specific subcellular localization. Among them, ASH1L-AS1 stood out due to strong translational evidence and its significant association with disease progression, poor prognosis, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and estrogen signaling. We confirmed that ASH1L-AS1 encodes a microprotein, APPLE, which is stably expressed in HCC cells and consistently upregulated in tumor tissues regardless of RAS mutation status. Functionally, APPLE promotes ERK1/2 phosphorylation, activates MAPK signaling, and enhances HCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor growth-effects reversed by APPLE knockdown or ERK1/2 inhibition. Mechanistically, APPLE binds to ERK1/2 and phosphatases PP1/PP2A, preventing ERK1/2 dephosphorylation and sustaining MAPK pathway activation. Additionally, the transcription factor E2F1 directly binds to the ASH1L-AS1 promoter (-\u2009300 to -\u2009290\u00a0bp), upregulating APPLE expression and further amplifying ERK1/2 signaling. Drug sensitivity analysis identified 220 treatment combinations potentially effective against HCC subtypes driven by hyperactivation of the E2F1-ASH1L-AS1/APPLE-ERK1/2 axis. This study characterized APPLE as a novel oncogenic microprotein encoded by lncRNA ASH1L-AS1, uncovering a non-canonical mechanism of MAPK activation in HCC. The identified E2F1-ASH1L-AS1/APPLE-ERK1/2 signaling axis provides new insights into HCC pathogenesis and represents a promising target for precision therapy, though further validation in clinical cohorts and preclinical studies is needed.",

In the evaluation set (two cohorts, n\u2009=\u2009111), the cross-validated model performance improved when pre-processed genomic data, such as mutation rates, were added to the clinical features. In the validation dataset (two cohorts, n\u2009=\u200973), the best model with genomic data outperformed the best model with clinical features alone. Finally, our best model outperformed with baseline genomic data, increasing the number of patients with a correctly predicted relapse by between +12% and +28%. In our models, baseline genomic data improved the prediction of response duration and could be incorporated into the development of predictive models of MAPKi treatment in melanoma.",

Although it generally has a low relapse risk, a significant proportion of B-ALL relapses occur within this subtype due to its relatively high incidence. Measurable residual disease at the end of induction therapy is a well-established biomarker predicting treatment outcomes, while no genomic biomarkers are routinely applied in clinics. In this study, we used multiomic data from ETV6::RUNX1 leukemias to identify genomic features predictive of therapy response at disease presentation. In the deeply characterized sub-cohort we discovered that fast-responding cases frequently exhibited the APOBEC mutational signature and the gene expression signature of high cell cycle activity. In contrast, rearrangements of IGK genes were more frequent in slow responders. Additionally, response-related mutations were identified in transcriptional regulators and tumor suppressor genes (INTS1, NF1, TP53). Copy number analysis revealed that fast responders harbored more frequent deletions of chr12 p-arm, leading to transcriptomic changes affecting genes associated with induction therapy response (KRAS, FKBP4), while a shorter gain in chr12 was more common in slow responders. The identified genetic and transcriptomic markers of treatment sensitivity pave the way for improved disease classification at presentation, potentially improving clinical outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Oncogenic mutations of Ras are among the most common genetic alterations in human cancer, with an estimated disease burden of >3 million new patients per year worldwide. Despite widespread appreciation of the importance of Ras in cancer, direct binding ligands, which block downstream signaling, were not reported until 2013 due to the lack of obvious drug binding pockets in the protein. The clinically approved K-Ras inhibitors are mutant-selective as they rely on covalent recognition of the highly nucleophilic somatic cysteine residue of K-Ras(G12C). Recent preclinical reports of noncovalent K-Ras binding inhibitors have emerged, which lack mutant specificity and exhibit varying degrees of biochemical preference for mutant K-Ras over the wild-type. An adjacent glycine-13 mutation, p. G13C, particularly abundant in lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer, has not been targeted with an approved therapeutic molecule. Here, we report a series of targeted electrophiles designed to covalently modify Cys13 in K-Ras(G13C), overcoming the structural challenge posed by its shifted position relative to Cys12 in K-Ras(G12C). These inhibitors effectively alkylate K-Ras(G13C) in both GDP- and GTP-bound states, block effector interactions, and suppress the growth of K-Ras(G13C)-mutation cancer cell lines. Our findings expand the landscape of covalent K-Ras inhibitors beyond G12 mutations, providing a new therapeutic strategy for K-Ras(G13C)-driven cancers.",

Traditionally, this is accomplished through the identification and targeting of highly recurrent mutations.

To address this, we have used a functional modeling approach, integrating drug screening with a Kinome Atlas-based assessment of signaling, to nominate a therapeutic regimen for ovarian tumors. This approach identifies a small-molecule RAS mimetic, rigosertib, as a tumor-selective agent and leads us to identify the combination of rigosertib with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition as effective combinations that prevent rigosertib-induced survival signaling while inducing regressions in ovarian cancer xenografts.

However, comprehensive germline genetic data from indigenous African populations remain scarce. This study aimed to explore germline genetic factors contributing to early-onset CRC (eoCRC) in Indigenous African patients using whole exome sequencing (WES). We performed WES on blood-derived genomic DNA from 32 Indigenous African patients diagnosed with eoCRC (<\u200950 years), who previously tested negative on a multigene CRC panel. While preliminary but definitive, pathogenic variants were identified in only 5 patients (16%) across genes such as C6, FAT1, LZTR1, PYCR1, and UGT1A7. A substantial proportion (47%, n\u2009=\u200915) carried variants of uncertain significance (VUS) with strong pathogenic potential (\"leaning pathogenic\") in genes ASXL1, CHEK2, ERBB2, ERCC4, INSR, KIT, MITF, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, PDGFRA, RAD51B, RAD54L, RASA1, RECQL, SUFU, VEGFA, and WT1. Comparative analysis with public datasets and recurrent findings suggests these leaning pathogenic VUSs may represent true disease-associated variants, currently may be misclassified due to limited representation of African genomes in reference databases. Our findings reveal a high burden of potentially pathogenic VUSs in indigenous African patients with eoCRC, reflecting both unique genetic architecture and a critical gap in global genomic equity. These variants may contribute to future variant reclassification and improved understanding of CRC predisposition in African populations. This study underscores the urgent need for population-specific genomic research and the development of inclusive variant databases to support accurate diagnosis and personalised care.",

This small subset of genes (0.35%) harbours introns containing non-canonical splicing sequences that are recognised uniquely by the minor spliceosome and cannot be processed by the major spliceosome. Using in vivo zebrafish and mouse cancer models, we show that heterozygous expression of Rnpc3, encoding a unique protein component of the minor spliceosome, restricts the growth and survival of liver, lung and gastric tumours without impacting healthy cells. RNPC3 knockdown in human lung cancer-derived A549 cells also impairs cell proliferation and RNA-seq analysis reveals a robust and selective disruption to minor intron splicing and transcription-wide effects on gene expression. We further demonstrate that these perturbations are accompanied by DNA replication stress, DNA damage, accumulation of TP53 protein and activation of a Tp53-dependent transcriptional program that induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Together our data reveal a vulnerability of cancer cells to minor splicing inhibition that restricts tumour growth.",

Beyond N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A), most other internal mRNA modifications lack dedicated catalytic machinery and are typically introduced by tRNA-modifying enzymes. The distribution and stoichiometry of these modifications on mRNAs remain debated and require further validation. Furthermore, their precise function remains controversial due to the challenges of excluding the intricate combinational effects of tRNA modifications. Here, we biochemically validate that NSUN6, a tRNA structure-dependent methyltransferase, independently catalyzes 5-methylcytidine (m<sup>5</sup>C) formation with robust activity on mRNA by recognizing the CUCCA motif in a certain stem-loop structure. NSUN6 employs different strategies to recognize tRNA and mRNA substrates. By introducing mutations, we further separate its catalytic capabilities toward mRNA and tRNA revealing that NSUN6 promotes breast cancer cell migration depending on mRNA m<sup>5</sup>C modification. Mechanistically, a cohort of mRNAs involved in cell migration carries high levels of NSUN6-mediated site-specific m<sup>5</sup>C modification, thus being stabilized by the preferential binding of m<sup>5</sup>C readers YBX1 and YBX3. Moreover, introducing a single-site high-level m<sup>5</sup>C can significantly increase the stability of therapeutic mRNAs in cells.

The current treatment methods for glioma are limited and patients with glioma often experience relapse following treatment, which leads to a poor prognosis for these patients. Therefore, novel therapeutic targets and methods urgently need to be explored. The present review screened studies that mainly focused on the epigenetic regulation of small guanosine triphosphate (GTP)ase in glioma. These small GTPases participate in most cellular biological processes, including differentiation, proliferation, cell migration, apoptosis, vesicle and organelle dynamics and transport, nuclear dynamics and cytoskeleton regulation. Due to the diversity and importance of the biological functions of small GTPases, an increasing number of studies have focused on them; however, the incidence of changes in the gene structure of small GTPases is considered to be low in glioma. Several studies have shown that the abnormal expression of genes encoding small GTPases is often influenced by epigenetic regulation in glioma. Epigenetic regulation is a dynamic and reversible process, which implies that the reversal of abnormal epigenetic modifications is a potential treatment strategy for glioma. These previous studies, which are summarized in the present review, not only provide new therapeutic targets and prognostic markers, but also provide information regarding the treatment of glioma. The current review may provide valuable insights for future research and promote the clinical translation of relevant research results.",

          "abstract": "Micropapillary carcinoma (MPC) is a type of tumor that is histopathologically characterized by the presence of small papillary structures. Literature data on somatic mutations in MPCs are very limited. One hundred fifty-nine\u00a0colon resection cases diagnosed with adenocarcinoma whose DNA mutations were analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) were retrospectively reviewed. In 10 cases, the MPC area exceeded 5%. Chi-square test was used to evaluate histopathologic characteristics and somatic mutations in MPCs and non-MPCs. The relationship between mutations and clinicopathological parameters in all cases was investigated. The presence of MPC areas in carcinomas was associated with higher histologic grades (MPC: n\u2009=\u20096; 60% vs. non-MPC: n\u2009=\u200922; 14.8%), more advanced pathologic T (pT4 MPC: n\u2009=\u20095; 50% vs. non-MPC: n\u2009=\u200946; 34.6%) and N stages (pN2b MPC: n\u2009=\u20095; 50% vs. non-MPC: n\u2009=\u200926; 19.5%) and more frequent tumor deposits (MPC: n\u2009=\u20097; 87.5% vs. non-MPC: n\u2009=\u200944; 46.8%), lymphovascular invasion (MPC: n\u2009=\u20098; 80% vs. non-MPC: n\u2009=\u200983; 55.7%), and perineural invasion (MPC: n\u2009=\u20097; 70% vs. non-MPC: n\u2009=\u200942; 28.2%). A significant difference was found between MPCs and non-MPCs in terms of histological grade (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and perineural invasion (p\u2009=\u20090.01). TP53, KRAS, and PIK3CA genes were the most frequently mutated genes in both MPCs and non-MPCs (TP53 MPC: n\u2009=\u20096; 100% vs. non-MPC: n\u2009=\u200972; 64.9% - KRAS MPC: n\u2009=\u20094; 40% vs. non-MPC: n\u2009=\u200966; 44.3% - PIK3CA MPC: n\u2009=\u20092; 20% vs. non-MPC: n\u2009=\u200932; 21.5%). There was no statistically significant difference in somatic mutations between the groups (TP53: p\u2009=\u20090.177, KRAS: p\u2009=\u20091.000, PIK3CA: p\u2009=\u20091.000, BRCA2: p\u2009=\u20090.181, ERBB2: p\u2009=\u20090.327, BRAF: p\u2009=\u20091.000, MAP2K1: p\u2009=\u20090.062). A significant difference was found between the TP53 mutant and TP53 wild-type groups in terms of tumor deposits (p\u2009=\u20090.033) and perineural invasion (p\u2009=\u20090.046). The male rate was significantly higher in KRAS wild-type cases (n\u2009=\u200969; 77.5%) compared to KRAS mutant cases (n\u2009=\u200938; 54.3%) (p\u2009=\u20090.002). The mean age, T and N staging were significantly different between PIK3CA mutant and PIK3CA wild-type cases (p\u2009=\u20090.01; p\u2009=\u20090.033; p\u2009=\u20090.019, respectively). We found that MPCs had more advanced clinical stages and histological features associated with poor prognosis, such as advanced T and N stages, higher histological grade, presence of tumor deposits, lymphovascular and perineural invasion.",

Although it has been implicated in DNA repair mechanisms and neurodegenerative diseases, its specific function within cancer biology remains poorly understood. This study conducted a pan-cancer analysis of ASCC1/2/3's roles in the tumorigenesis process and explored their regulatory effects on lung adenocarcinoma. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 10,967 tumor samples across 30 distinct cancer types. It was found that alterations in ASCC1/2/3 occurred in 754 cases (7% of the patients analyzed), with ASCC3 being the most frequently altered at 4%. Furthermore, elevated expression levels of ASCC1/2/3 were observed in the majority of cancer types examined. Notably, the expression levels of ASCC1 and ASCC3 demonstrated a correlation with CD4-positive T cell infiltration. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the ASCC family effectively inhibited tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion in lung adenocarcinoma cell line. Our findings indicate a significant association between the ASCC family and tumors while providing a foundation for further investigation into its role in cancer biology and potential clinical applications.",

Here, we show that elevated expression of the transcription factor FOXK1 promotes transcription of E2F target genes and cellular transformation. High expression of FOXK1 in patient tumors is also strongly correlated with E2F gene expression. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that FOXK1 is O-GlcNAcylated, and loss of this modification impairs FOXK1 ability to promote cell proliferation and tumor growth. We also show that expression of FOXK1 O-GlcNAcylation-defective mutants results in reduced recruitment of the H2AK119 deubiquitinase and tumor suppressor BAP1 to E2F target genes. This event is associated with a transcriptional repressive chromatin environment and reduced cell proliferation. Our results define an essential role of FOXK1 O-GlcNAcylation in co-opting the tumor suppressor BAP1 to promote cancer cell progression through orchestration of the E2F pathway.",

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly malignant and aggressive brain tumor with patients typically experiencing a median survival of 15-18 months after diagnosis. Gap junction protein Connexin43 (Cx43) plays a crucial role in GBM by having both tumor-suppressing and tumor-promoting roles. Here, we identify a critical tumor-promoting role of Cx43 in GBM by functioning as a non-canonical phenotypic stability factor and driving partial EMT, which enhances the acquisition of stemness properties in the cells. Using high-grade mouse astrocytoma cell lines, we found that CT2A cells had higher Cx43 gap junction assembly as compared to KR158 cells. The increased Cx43 assembly in CT2A cells activates the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, promoting a hybrid E/M phenotype and thereby enhancing self-renewal properties. CT2A cells also exhibited collective cell migration, a characteristic feature of hybrid E/M phenotype, stress resistance, and proliferative properties. To verify Cx43's role in NF-\u03baB pathway activation, DBT and DBT-Erp-29 cells (with higher Cx43 expression) were studied, showing increased NF-\u03baB activation in DBT-Erp-29 cells. Interestingly, KR158 cells formed longer tunneling nanotubes to expedite alternative cellular communication due to reduced gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). These results offer valuable insights into targeting Cx43-mediated signaling pathways due to the potential tumor-promoting role of Cx43.",

More than 90% of PDAC tumors are caused by <i>KRAS</i> mutations, with the majority expressing the K-Ras(G12D) oncoprotein. Despite extensive drug discovery efforts across academia and industry, there are no approved drugs directly targeting K-Ras(G12D) in a mutant-selective manner. We report a series of \u03b1-diazoacetamide compounds that form covalent bonds via denitrogenative alkylation of acquired aspartic acid at the mutation site. The lead molecule allosterically inhibits the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway downstream of K-Ras and therefore inhibits the growth of <i>KRAS</i><sup>G12D</sup>-driven cancer cell lines but not non-G12D mutation cancer cell lines. Our results show that the diazo-carboxy ligation spares not only the unreactive Gly12 residue in the K-Ras wild-type protein but also strong nucleophiles such as the Cys12 residue in K-Ras(G12C). The preference for a weak nucleophile carboxylic acid over canonically stronger nucleophiles provides the basis to expand the covalently targetable proteome to aspartic and glutamic acids.",

In 23 cases, the SAC area exceeded 50%. A chi-square test was used to evaluate histopathologic characteristics and somatic mutations in SACs and non-serrated adenocarcinomas (non-SACs). <i>Results</i>: A significant difference was found in histological grade (<i>p</i> = 0.019) between SACs and non-SACs. <i>TP53</i>, <i>KRAS</i>, and <i>PIK3CA</i> genes have been identified as the most frequently mutated genes in both SACs and non-SACs.

This finding is consistent with the recent literature reporting a higher prevalence of <i>KRAS</i> mutations in colorectal SACs, in contrast to previous studies.

Gene expression regulation by non-coding RNAs involves the prevention of mRNA accumulation or the inhibition of translation of their target gene. In a forward-genetic screen to identify the microRNA involved in the growth and patterning of the Drosophila eye, we identified the highly conserved miR-137. Gain of function of miR-137 results in a reduced-eye phenotype by downregulating retinal determination and differentiation markers, and by upregulating negative regulators of eye development, such as Wingless (Wg) and Homothorax (Hth). Loss of function of miR-137 results in an enlarged-eye phenotype. Using bioinformatics and genetic approaches, we identified the oncogene Myc as the target of miR-137. Gain of function of Myc can rescue the reduced-eye phenotype of miR-137 gain of function, and vice versa. We tested the role of miR-137 in regulating Myc levels in the RasV12;scribRNAi, a tumor model of oncogenic cooperation that results in neoplastic tumors. Gain of function of miR-137 in the RasV12;scribRNAi background significantly reduced tumor phenotype as well as Myc levels in the eye. Our studies highlight miR-137 as a post-transcriptional regulator of Myc and a promising therapeutic target for diseases associated with Myc accumulation.",

To assess MTAP prevalence in prostate cancer, a tissue microarray of 17,747 samples was analyzed via immunohistochemistry. Normal prostate glands showed weak to moderate cytoplasmic MTAP staining. In 13,189 interpretable cancers, a complete loss of MTAP staining was seen in 33 (0.3 %) tumors, while MTAP staining was considered 1+ in 14.8 %, 2+ in 42.2 %, and 3+ in 42.7 % of tumors. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of 9 MTAP-negative cancers confirmed homozygous MTAP deletion in all of these tumors. MTAP staining was significantly stronger in cancers harboring the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion than in ERG fusion negative tumors (p < 0.0001). A comparison with clinico-pathological features revealed inverse correlations depending on the ERG fusion status: In ERG-negative cancers, high (3+) MTAP expression correlated with advanced pT stage, high Gleason grade, and early PSA recurrence (p < 0.0001 each). Conversely, in ERG-positive tumors, MTAP expression decreased with advanced pT stage (p < 0.0001), high classical (p = 0.0004) and quantitative Gleason grade (p = 0.0005), and low (1+) MTAP expression was significantly linked to early PSA recurrence (p = 0.0012). Comparison with 11 previously analyzed chromosomal deletions identified ERG-status-dependent positive or negative associations between MTAP expression and deletions of PTEN and 12p13 (p \u2264 0.0274), suggesting functional interactions.

Here, we demonstrated that low expression of the DNA damage response gene Schlafen 11 (<i>SLFN11</i>) correlates with poor overall survival and worse prognosis in patients with AML. Moreover, we showed that SLFN11 plays an essential role in regulating chemotherapy sensitivity in AML. AML cells with suppressed levels of SLFN11 do not undergo apoptosis in response to cytarabine because of aberrant activation of the Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR)/Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) pathway, allowing for DNA damage repair, whereas sensitivity to cytarabine can be restored by inhibiting the ATR pathway. Importantly, <i>SLFN11</i> knockout AML cells retain sensitivity to hypomethylating agents and the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor venetoclax. Altogether, these results reveal <i>SLFN11</i> as an important regulator and predictor of chemotherapy sensitivity in AML and suggest that targeting pathways suppressed by SLFN11 may offer potential combination therapies to enhance and optimize chemotherapy responses in AML.",

Ras Suppressor Protein 1 (RSU1) has been proven to play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of multiple malignant tumors, while its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) is rarely reported. The aim of this study is to investigate the expression and prognostic of RSU1 in CRC, and its effect on the proliferation and migration of the human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines, Caco-2 cells to reveal the potential mechanism of proliferation and migration of CRC. Firstly, Kaplan-Meier plotter, Tumor immune estimate resource version 2 (TIMER2.0) databases and so on were used to assess prognostic implications and correlation of immune infiltration of RSU1 expression in CRC. For further exploration, in vitro experiments were performed to knock down RSU1 expression in Caco-2 cells with RSU1-siRNA. CCK8 assay, colony formation assay and wound healing assay were executed to detect the proliferation and migration of Caco-2 cells after RSU1 knockdown. Finally, functional enrichment analyses of RSU1 in CRC were performed to explore the specific molecular mechanisms, and the expression of related molecules was further verified by western blot analysis. According to the bioinformatic databases, RSU1 expression was increased in CRC tissues compared with normal colorectal tissues. High RSU1 expression was not conducive to Overall (OS), Relapse-free survival (RFS) and Post-progression survival (PPS) prognosis. Moreover, high expression of RSU1 decreased the immune infiltration level of CD<sup>8+</sup> T-cell in CRC, also account for that high RSU1 expression was may be related to the bad survival prognosis of CRC. Functionally, RSU1 knockdown inhibited proliferation and migration of Caco-2 cells. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed a significant connection between RSU1 and the Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway in CRC, western blot analysis also showed that RSU1 knockdown decreased PI3K and AKT protein expression. Silencing the RSU1 gene can significantly reduce the proliferation ability of Caco-2 cells and inhibit their migration behavior by suppressing the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that RSU1 was highly expressed in CRC. Its high expression was not conducive to the prognosis of patients and would also reduce the immune infiltration level of CD<sup>8+</sup> T cells. These findings provide a preliminary theoretical basis for the research on RSU1 as a potential target for prognosis assessment and immunotherapy of CRC.",

          "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The pathogenesis of CRC primarily stems from\u00a0the gradual accumulation of genetic mutations, which drive oncogene (e.g., KRAS) activation and tumor suppressor gene (e.g., TP53) inactivation. Loss of genetic stability facilitates the conversion of proto-oncogenes into active oncogenes and the functional impairment of tumor suppressors, collectively propelling CRC progression. The tumor suppressor protein p53, a transcription factor, induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair under cellular stress, and prevents cancer development by regulating various cellular responses. However, in CRC pathogenesis, TP53 mutations (detected in\u2009~\u200974% of cases) subvert these protective mechanisms through dual mechanisms: (i) dominant-negative suppression of wild-type p53 (wt-p53) function, and (ii) acquisition of neomorphic pro-tumorigenic activities, termed gain-of-function (GOF) mutations. New evidence from laboratory and clinical trials shows that some new therapeutic strategies have the potential to treat CRC by reactivating and restoring p53 function, depleting p53 mutants, or targeting p53 with immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize the function of p53 and characterize its mutation in CRC, emphasizing the influence of p53 mutation in the pathogenesis of CRC. In addition, we also describe the current therapeutic strategies for targeting p53 mutants in CRC.",

Our results showed that DBF4B was significantly differentially expressed in most cancer types as well as in cancers with different molecular and immune subtypes, and DBF4B was also significantly correlated with the prognosis of a subset of cancers. Furthermore, our analysis showed that DBF4B expression in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) was associated with a variety of factors, including age, gender, race, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), presence of residual tumor, and tumor status. Elevated DBF4B expression was correlated with poorer overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free interval (PFI). especially in different clinical subtypes.

Experimentally, ZC3H4 deficiency led to increased DNA damage, abnormal mitosis, and cellular senescence. Biochemical analysis and super-resolution microscopy revealed that the loss of ZC3H4 increased replication stress (RS)-a major driver of genome instability-by inducing a hypertranscription state that promoted R loop formation and transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs), both of which drive RS. Further bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that ZC3H4 preferentially binds to genomic regions prone to TRCs and R loops, where it suppresses ncRNA bursts, functioning as part of the Restrictor complex. Our findings identify ZC3H4 as a crucial factor in maintaining genome integrity, strategically positioned at the critical intersection of DNA and RNA synthesis.",

Recent research underscored its potential to revert the malignant phenotype, as evidenced in vivo studies, while the scarcity of research about DCAF5 challenges for its development as a novel target for cancer treatment. We conducted an immunohistochemical analysis to compare the expression levels of DCAF5 in renal clear cell carcinoma tissues with those in adjacent non-neoplastic tissues. Subsequently, we performed survival analyses to explore the correlation between DCAF5 expression and patient outcomes. Multiple public databases were used such as the UCSC Xena platform, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. The raw data extracted from the UCSC Xena platform was subsequently processed utilizing online analytical tools to facilitate further in-depth examination. Our investigation has discovered a significant reduction in DCAF5 expression within renal clear cell carcinoma tissues when juxtaposed with adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Further experimental validation demonstrated that patients with higher pathology grades exhibited lower DCAF5 expression. In a broader oncological context, our comprehensive analysis across various cancer types revealed a heterogeneous expression pattern of DCAF5. Concurrently, an examination of publicly accessible databases has highlighted a notable correlation between DCAF5 expression and both immune scores and immune cell infiltration in a range of cancer types. It is noteworthy that DCAF5 's potential as an immunotherapy biomarker was recognized, distinguishing it from several established markers in this domain. Finally, our analysis of genetic alterations identified gene amplification as the predominant form of aberration affecting the DCAF5 gene. Our findings reveal that DCAF5 exhibits context-dependent dual roles across cancers and demonstrates superior predictive value over traditional biomarkers like TMB in immunotherapy. This highlights its potential as a dual-functional biomarker for prognosis and immunotherapy personalization, particularly in SMARCB1-deficient malignancies.",

They were transfected in COS-7 cells and subjected to ox-LDL stimulations to observe the different reactions. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) was performed to show what proteins combined with OLR1 mutants in reaction to ox-LDL. Lipid uptake in human monocytes (THP-1) originated foam cells overexpressing somatic mutant of OLR1 were also determined. Further studies focusing on these regions were conducted using truncation mutants and site-specific mutants such as G43A, V44A, L45A, C46A, and L47A.ResultsAmino acids within the TM were highly conserved, spanning amino acids 35 to 57. The induction of intracellular p-ERK1/2 in response to ox-LDL stimulation was highly promoted in Chimera 3 possessing the TM from OLR1 like OLR1/WT (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). Sequence alignment revealed two conserved regions within the TM of OLR1, Leu45-Cys46-Leu47 and Val55-Leu56-Gly57. Western blot showed that most of the TM changes ablated ERK1/2 activation in response to ox-LDL stimulation (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). One human somatic mutation at L45F revealed significantly lower p-ERK1/2 levels with enhanced intake of ox-LDL in THP-1-derived foam cells than the control cells (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). L45A and C46A molecular complexes were identified. After ox-LDL stimulation, these underlined interactions with keratins, namely KRT2 and KRT6A.ConclusionThese findings emphasize the vital role of the TM in the interactions between OLR1 and ox-LDL and point to an exciting possibility that signal transduction induced by ox-LDL through its receptor OLR1 may involve complex interactions with cytoskeletal proteins.",

To investigate HMGA2's role in cancer, a tissue microarray of 18,582 samples from 154 tumor types and 608 samples from 76 normal tissues was analyzed. HMGA2 expression was generally higher in cancer than in normal tissues. Of the 15,915 tumor samples, 37.5% showed HMGA2 positivity: 12% weak, 11.5% moderate, and 13.9% strong. HMGA2 was detected in at least one case in 118 of 144 tumor categories, with strong staining in 92 categories. The frequency of HMGA2 positivity was highest in cancers of the ovary and the endometrium (52.6-92.6%), thyroidal neoplasms (53.4-95%), salivary gland neoplasms (66.7-98%), and non-seminomatous testicular germ cell tumors (73.5-93.5%). High-level HMGA2 staining was associated with invasive tumor growth of urinary bladder cancers (p\u2009<\u20090.0001); high-grade, advanced pT, metastasis, and poor overall survival (p\u2009<\u20090.0001 each) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC); nodal metastasis in papillary RCC (p\u2009=\u20090.0099); as well as nodal metastasis in papillary thyroid cancer (p\u2009=\u20090.0063). Low HMGA2 expression was linked to microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer (p\u2009=\u20090.0002) and HPV infection in squamous cell carcinomas (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). It is concluded that HMGA2 is highly expressed in a very broad range of tumor entities. These findings emphasize a potential role of HMGA2 as a drug target and suggest utility for HMGA2 IHC for the distinction of neoplastic from non-neoplastic tissues in several organs.",

Despite decades of research studying p53 function, treatment of p53-mutant cancers remains challenging owing to the effects of p53 mutations on many complex and interrelated signaling networks that promote tumor metastasis and chemoresistance. Mutations in p53 promote tumor survival by dysregulating cellular homeostasis and preventing activation of regulated cell death (RCD) pathways, which normally promote organismal health by eliminating dysregulated cells. Activation of RCD is a hallmark of effective cancer therapies, and p53-mutant cancers may be particularly susceptible to activation of certain RCD pathways. In this review, we discuss four RCD pathways that are the targets of emerging cancer therapeutics to treat p53-mutant cancers. These RCD pathways include E2F1-dependent apoptosis, necroptosis, mitochondrial permeability transition-driven necrosis, and ferroptosis. We discuss mechanisms of RCD activation, effects of p53 mutation on RCD activation, and current pharmaceutical strategies for RCD activation in p53-mutant cancers.",

The study reveals that the autophagy-regulating gene PLAC8 (placenta-specific 8) is significantly involved in Cd-induced prostate carcinogenesis, and NF-\u03baB acts as the upstream transcriptional activator of PLAC8, which then selectively up-regulates BCL-xL, providing a survival advantage to Cd-transformed cells. NF-\u03baB activation stabilizes PLAC8 in the cytosol, disrupting autophagy by allowing PLAC8 to colocalize with LC3B instead of LAMP1. Silencing NF-\u03baB down-regulates PLAC8 and its survival function while inhibiting NF-\u03baB or PLAC8, which restores autophagy and decreases tumor growth in xenograft models. In addition, targeting BCL-xL confirmed this signaling pathway. The findings suggest that sustained NF-\u03baB activation regulates PLAC8 and highlights the NF-\u03baB-PLAC8-BCL-xL axis as a potential target for early detection and therapies in metal-induced prostate cancer.",

          "abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality in women, often diagnosed at advanced stages. While first-line treatments improve survival, relapses remain common, with 5-year survival rates below 40%. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising biomarker for non-invasive EOC detection and monitoring. It may help assess treatment response, notably microscopic residual disease. Our objective was to compare two ctDNA characterization strategies in EOC for assessing tumor burden during first-line treatment: a tumor-informed approach based on somatic mutations and a tumor-type informed approach utilizing DNA methylation patterns. In the tumor-informed approach, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on EOC tumor DNA and matched PBMCs from 22 patients to identify tumor-specific mutations. Personalized panels were then designed to track these mutations in plasma cfDNA. In the tumor-type informed approach, differentially methylated loci (DMLs) were identified by comparing EOC samples, healthy ovarian tissues, and PBMCs. A unique custom methylation panel was designed, and a support vector machine classifier was trained to distinguish between methylation profiles in plasma cfDNA from healthy donors and from EOC patients. Plasma samples from 47 advanced-stage EOC patients receiving chemotherapy and 54 healthy subjects were analyzed. For the tumor-informed approach, WES identified an average of 72 somatic mutations per patient. For the tumor-type informed approach, 52,173 DMLs were identified as tumor-specific markers. In 47 plasma samples tested by both approaches, ctDNA levels were significantly correlated (R\u2009=\u20090.56, p\u2009=\u20094.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-</sup><sup>5</sup>), with 70.2% concordance in detection. At baseline, ctDNA was detected in 21/22 patients with the tumor-informed approach, and in 11/12 non-training baseline samples with the tumor-type-informed classifier. At end-of-treatment, the latter detected ctDNA in 16/22 samples, outperforming the former. Detection using this more sensitive approach was significantly associated with relapse (log-rank p\u2009=\u20090.009; hazard ratio\u2009=\u20099.44; 95% CI 1.22-73.26) and poorer overall survival (log-rank p\u2009=\u20090.041). The tumor-type informed classifier demonstrated sensitivity and specificity for ctDNA detection, outperforming the tumor-informed approach in monitoring EOC progression. Requiring fewer sequencing data, it offers a practical, efficient solution for clinical management of EOC.",

          "abstract": "EGFR family receptor tyrosine kinase signaling is commonly dysregulated in cancer by amplification or activating mutations. Although studies have investigated dual EGFR/PI3K inhibition in breast cancer, they have not determined biomarkers which predict success. We present evidence of a patient subset with EGFR amplification and PI3Kinase pathway mutations in breast cancer which can be synergistically targeted by dual EGFR/PI3K inhibition. This study identified that EGFR amplification occurs in approximately 1-5% of breast cancer patients with shorter overall survival compared to unamplified patients. Up to 71% of EGFR amplified tumors have activating mutations in the PI3K pathway. Dual EGFR/PI3K inhibition more dramatically reduced mTOR and AKT signaling in BT20 and MDA-MB-468 cells which both have EGFR amplification and PI3K pathway activating mutations, compared to control cells. Dual inhibition synergistically reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 and BT20 compared to control. Single agent therapy in a BT20 xenograft model reduced tumor volume, however only the combination statistically significantly reduced tumor volume compared to control. We conclude that EGFR amplification with co-incident PI3K pathway mutations are driver mutations in a subset of breast cancers and present a subgroup of breast cancers that are more likely to respond to dual targeted therapy.",

Although required by major guidelines, little is known about the current EMTB composition and working outcomes. The present study aims to analyse the use and support provided by an experienced EMTB, highlighting the skills of this board. This monocentric and retrospective study considered all the cases discussed (N=1038, concerning 835 patients) within the ETMB of Careggi University Hospital of Florence from January 1st, 2021, to December 31st, 2023. The queries have been standardised into five major groups. Besides treatment and follow-up indications, particular attention has been paid to the need for repeated discussions, additional indications, imaging revisions, and overall survival (OS) outcomes. Thyroid and rare cancers were the most frequently represented (64% and 32%, respectively). At logistic regression analysis, the need for multiple discussions was associated with being a rare disease (p<0.001), familiar syndrome (p=0.003), or adrenal masses (p=0.005). When the query was \"imaging review,\" external imaging was more often re-evaluated (p=0.027) due to differing results at EMTB revision, and in about 51% of these cases, further insights were requested. Compared to external control groups, Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma and Adrenocortical Carcinoma showed improved OS, 7.84 vs 2.46 months (p=0.049) and 51.92 vs 26.17 months (p=0.0076), respectively. From the hormonal perspective, further hormonal investigations were required in about 16% of eligible cases. EMTB is pivotal in managing and optimising common and rare endocrine tumour workups.",

The lack of a specific target for CMA inhibition has limited CMA blockage to genetic manipulations or global lysosomal function inhibition. Here, using genetic modulation, transcriptional analysis, and functional studies, we demonstrate a regulatory role for the interaction of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR\u03b1) and its corepressor, the nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1), on CMA in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). By targeting the disruption of the NCoR1/RAR\u03b1 complex with a structure-based screening strategy, we identified compound CIM7, a potent and selective CMA inhibitor that has no effect on macroautophagy. CIM7 preferentially inhibits CMA in NSCLC cells over normal cells, reduces tumor growth in NSCLC cells, and demonstrates efficacy in an in vivo xenograft mouse model with no observed toxicity in blood or major tissues. These findings reveal a druggable mechanism for selective CMA inhibition and a first-in-class CMA inhibitor as a potential therapeutic strategy for NSCLC.",

          "abstract": "Reactivation of transposable elements (TEs) in somatic tissues, particularly of LINE-1, is associated with disease by causing gene mutations and DNA damage. Previous work has shown that the PIWI pathway is crucial for TE suppression in the germline. However, the status and function of this pathway is not well characterized in differentiated somatic cells and there is lack of consensus on the role of the pathway in somatic tumorigenesis. To shed light on this conundrum, we examined the PIWI pathway in colon cancer through combining bioinformatic analyses and cell-based assays. Shifted Weighted Annotation Network (SWAN) analysis revealed that the pathway experiences significant allelic losses in colon cancer and that PIWIL2, the main catalytic component of the pathway responsible for TE silencing, experiences the highest percent deletions. PIWIL2 is downregulated in colon tumors of advanced stage, nodal metastasis, and in certain subtypes, correlating with poor survival, while it is also downregulated in ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease that predisposes to colon cancer. PIWIL2 depletion in colon epithelial Caco2 cells leads to increased anchorage-independent growth, loss of transposon-targeting - non-canonical - piRNAs, increased LINE-1 levels and activity, and in DNA damage, altogether highlighting a tumor-suppressing role of PIWIL2 in the colon.",

          "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a significant health challenge, particularly in the Indian subcontinent, where it is the second leading cause of cancer. Smoking, including waterpipe tobacco smoking, is a major risk factor for OSCC and contributes to the onset of malignancy through the absorption of carcinogenic compounds present in tobacco smoke. This study investigated the role of the oncogene Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) signaling pathway in OSCC progression, focusing on how exposure to waterpipe smoke condensate (WPSC) influences cellular proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and YAP1 activity. Using immortalized human oral keratinocytes (HOK) and OSCC cell lines, we found that WPSC significantly enhanced cell proliferation, increased colony formation, and elevated YAP1 expression compared to controls. Notably, WPSC treatment resulted in the downregulation of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and the upregulation of mesenchymal markers, indicating a shift towards an invasive phenotype. Further bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset confirmed that YAP1 is frequently altered in HNSCC, highlighting its role in OSCC carcinogenesis. Our findings establish YAP1 as a central mediator in the response of oral keratinocytes to the oncogenic effects of waterpipe smoking, promoting EMT and enhancing invasive characteristics of OSCC cells. These results underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting the YAP1 signaling pathway in OSCC treatment, particularly in individuals exposed to waterpipe smoke. Future research should elucidate the molecular mechanisms of WPSC-induced YAP1 activation and EMT, paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies to combat OSCC.",

          "abstract": "Concurrent genetic alterations (e.g., TP53 comutations) significantly impair EGFR-TKI responsiveness and survival outcomes in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A), which is a key subunit of SWI/SNF complexes, demonstrates critical regulatory functions as a tumour suppressor gene in cancer. The aim of this study is to determine the role of ARID1A deficiency in the therapeutic efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in LUAD. We identified the ARID1A mutation as a potential prognostic marker in EGFR-mutant LUAD by analysing data from cBioPortal. The expression of ARID1A was detected via immunohistochemical staining. A lentivirus was employed to construct the ARID1A knockdown model in PC9 cell. We further analyzed the biological roles of ARID1A knockdown through CCK8, flow cytometry analysis and transwell assay. The ARID1A mutation was associated with poor OS in EGFR-mutant LUAD patients, and the prognostic influence was greater than that of concurrent EGFR mutations with TP53, KRAS, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, RB1 or PTEN. By analysing the clinical data of our centre, we revealed that patients with loss of ARID1A expression demonstrated poorer median progression-free survival (mPFS, 10.3 versus 30 months, <i>P</i> = 0.005) when they received EGFR-TKIs as the first-line treatment after postoperative progression (cohort A). A shorter median disease-free survival (mDFS, 29 versus NA months, <i>P</i> = 0.003) was also observed in the ARID1A low-expression cohort than in the ARID1A high-expression group in patients receiving postoperative adjuvant EGFR-TKI treatments (cohort B). We also found that ARID1A deficiency attenuated the efficacy of osimertinib by activating the EGFR/AKT/mTOR signalling axis in PC9 cell. ARID1A deficiency may be an independent prognostic factor and attenuates the response to EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR-mutant LUAD. In addition, loss of ARID1A expression confers resistance to EGFR-TKI by activating the EGFR/AKT/mTOR signalling axis.",

Reversion mutations that restore homologous recombination (HR) repair are detected in ~50 to 80% of BRCA-mutant patients who respond but subsequently relapse, but there is currently little insight into why only ~50% of BRCA-mutant patients display upfront resistance. To address this question, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genomic determinants of PARPi resistance in murine <i>Brca2<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i> prostate organoids genetically engineered in a manner that precludes the development of reversion mutations. Remarkably, we recovered multiple independent single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting three different members (<i>Cdt1, Cdc6,</i> and <i>Dbf4</i>) of the DNA prereplication complex (pre-RC), each of which independently conferred resistance to olaparib and the next-generation PARP-1 selective inhibitor AZD5305. Moreover, sensitivity to PARP inhibition was restored in <i>Brca2<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i>, Cdc6-depleted prostate cells by knockdown of geminin, a negative regulator of Cdt1, further implicating the critical role of a functional pre-RC complex in PARPi sensitivity. Furthermore, ~50% of CRPC tumors have copy number loss of pre-RC complex genes, particularly <i>CDT1</i>. Mechanistically, prostate cells with impaired pre-RC activity displayed rapid resolution of olaparib-induced DNA damage as well as protection from replication fork degradation caused by Brca2 loss, providing insight into how Brca2-mutant cancer cells can escape cell death from replication stress induced by PARP inhibition in the absence of HR repair. Of note, a pharmacologic inhibitor that targets the CDT1/geminin complex (AF615) restored sensitivity to AZD5305, providing a potential translational avenue to enhance sensitivity to PARP inhibition.",

The \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptor \u03c0 subunit (GABRP) is aberrantly expressed in cancers, but its role in immune evasion is poorly defined. To elucidate the mechanism of GABRP-driven TME remodeling and evaluate its therapeutic potential. Pan-cancer bioinformatics analysis (TCGA, GEPIA2, cBioPortal) assessed GABRP expression, survival associations, and immune infiltration across 33 cancers. Functional studies included GABRP knockdown in glioma cells (U87/U251) via lentiviral RNAi, proliferation/migration assays (CCK-8, scratch test), and pathway analysis. Subcutaneous xenografts in BALB/c-nu mice evaluated the GABA_A inhibitor Amentoflavone. Immune profiling utilized ssGSEA and TIMER. GABRP was overexpressed in gliomas and other cancers (breast, gastric), correlating with poor prognosis (HR\u2009=\u20091.8, p\u2009=\u20090.008) and enriched immunosuppressive cells (Tregs, M2 macrophages). Knockdown suppressed proliferation (IC50\u219342%), migration (> 50% delay, p\u2009<\u20090.01), and PI3K/AKT signaling. Amentoflavone reduced tumor volume by 68% (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and reversed GABA-mediated T cell inhibition. GABRP promotes immune evasion via GABA overproduction, recruiting Tregs/M2 macrophages to establish an immunosuppressive TME. Targeting GABRP or GABA signaling (e.g., Amentoflavone) restores antitumor immunity. Limitations include cohort size and tissue-specific heterogeneity. GABRP is a key regulator of tumor immunosuppression. Dual strategies-blocking GABRP expression or GABA signaling-offer novel therapeutic avenues.

          "abstract": "The E3 ubiquitin ligase HECW1 was found to be involved in ubiquitination modifications during malignant progression of multiple tumors. However, the prognostic role of HECW1 expression in gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear. The Tumor Immunoassay Resource (TIMER2.0) system evaluated the association of HECW1 with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in carcinomas. The UALCAN assessed HECW1 mRNA expression levels in GC tissues and examined their associations with clinicopathological characteristics. The Kaplan Meier-plotter analyzed the effect of HECW1 on the survival of GC patients. The cBioPortal retrieved information about genetic variants in HECW1 gene. Protein\u2012protein interaction (PPI) networks associated with HECW1 were explored using the STRING database. The functional effects of HECW1 on GC cells were evaluated through proliferation (Cell Counting Kit-8), apoptosis (Flow cytometry), and migration (Transwell and wound healing assays). The RNA-Seq was applied to explore the underlying mechanisms. HECW1 demonstrated significant overexpression in GC tumor tissues, correlating with adverse clinical outcomes. Clinically, elevated HECW1 expression exhibited an inverse association with tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes while demonstrating a positive correlation with macrophages, DCs, and neutrophils infiltration, suggesting its potential involvement in tumor immune evasion mechanisms. Functional validation revealed that HECW1 knockdown markedly suppressed GC cell proliferation and migratory capacity, concurrently promoting apoptotic cell death. Mechanistic investigations identified that HECW1 exerts its oncogenic effects through dysregulation of the Hippo signaling pathway, with its silencing effectively attenuating tumor progression via pathway modulation. HECW1 upregulation is significantly associated with poor prognosis and immune infiltration in GC patients, emphasizing its potential as a prognostic biomarker.",

          "abstract": "Despite the significance of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in solid tumor treatment, identifying ICI-sensitive populations remains a challenge. Mutations in DNA damage response (DDR) pathway genes are increasingly linked to favorable ICI responses; however, selection criteria for specific DDR pathway biomarkers remain elusive. Data of patients with cancer who received ICIs and non-ICI therapy were extracted from public databases. Synthetic lethal (SL) gene combinations were selected from the SynLethDB database. Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to investigate the correlation between SL gene co-mutations in DDR pathways and prognosis. Immune infiltration analysis was performed using the Timer online tool based on DNA and RNA sequences obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Patients with synthetic lethal co-mutations in DDR pathways exhibited significantly extended overall survival (HRhazard ratio [HR], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.92]; <i>P</i> = .0061), progression-free survival (HR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.18 to 0.60]; <i>P</i> = .0003), and higher objective response rates (66.7% <i>v</i> 21.0%; <i>P</i> = .0009) after receiving ICIs. Conversely, DDR SL co-mut<sup>+</sup> patients receiving non-ICI treatment presented with markedly shortened survival (HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.16 to 1.56]; <i>P</i> < .0001). High-frequency DDR SL co-mutation pairs were enriched in the checkpoint factor pathway. <i>TP53-ATM</i> emerged as a common combination, with <i>TP53-ATM</i> co-mut<sup>+</sup> patients receiving more survival benefits from ICI (HR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.99]; <i>P</i> = .045). Immune infiltration analysis demonstrated altered immune reactivity in <i>TP53-ATM</i> co-mut<sup>+</sup> tumors, with higher levels of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, plasma cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, and myeloid dendritic cells but lower levels of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Our study identified SL co-mutations in the DDR pathway as promising biomarkers for ICI efficacy. Specifically, the <i>TP53-ATM</i> co-mutation status can be applied in identifying ICI-responsive patients. SL co-mutations in DDR pathways correlate with modification of the tumor immune microenvironment, shaping a favorable niche for ICIs to stimulate immune responses.",

In this study, we compared the transcriptional signatures of normal thyroid (NT) and PTC-derived MSCs with the aim of determining if these have distinct transcriptomes that might influence PTC progression. We used flow cytometry in combination with a panel of MSC clusters of differentiation (CD) markers and showed that both thyroid MSC populations expressed MSC markers and lacked expression of markers not normally expressed by MSCs. In addition, we determined that both MSC populations could differentiate to adipocytes and osteocytes. Analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data from both MSC populations revealed, regardless of tissue of origin, that both contained similar numbers of subpopulations. Cluster analysis revealed similarity in expression of both MSC populations for stromal markers, the vascular marker <i>VEGFA</i> and the smooth muscle marker <i>CALD1</i>, while smaller subpopulations expressed markers of more lineage-committed thyroid cells. PTC MSCs also showed upregulated expression of 28 genes, many of which are known to be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and/or disease progression in several types of cancers, including but not limited to breast cancer, gastric cancer, cervical carcinoma, bladder cancer and thyroid cancer. This included several members of the <i>S100</i> and <i>IGFBP</i> gene families. Taken together, these data support a role for PTC MSCs in PTC progression.",

Our innovation combines flexible prompt templates, the direct production of analysis-ready tabular data, and a rigorous, human-in-the-loop iterative refinement process guided by a comprehensive error ontology. Applying the finalized pipeline to 2297 kidney tumor reports with pre-existing templated data available for validation yielded a macro-averaged F1 of 0.99 for six kidney tumor subtypes and 0.97 for detecting kidney metastasis. We further demonstrate flexibility with multiple LLM backbones and adaptability to new domains, utilizing publicly available breast and prostate cancer reports.

          "abstract": "Lemur Tail Kinase 3 (LMTK3) promotes cell proliferation, invasiveness and therapy resistance, and its expression correlates with poor survival in several different malignancies, including breast cancer. Crosstalk through extracellular vesicles (EVs) is an increasingly appreciated mechanism of cell communication within the tumour immune microenvironment, which contributes to different aspects of cancer progression and plays a pivotal role in shaping tumour fate. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy were used to study the effects of LMTK3 on EV size, while single particle interferometry allowed us to examine LMTK3-dependent effects on the subpopulation distribution of EVs. Quantitative mass spectrometry was used to profile LMTK3-dependent proteomics changes in breast cancer-derived EVs. Bioinformatics analysis of clinical data along with in vitro and cell-based assays were implemented to explore the effects of LMTK3-dependent EV protein cargo on the tumour immune microenvironment. To elucidate the mechanism through which LMTK3 impacts endosomal trafficking and regulates EV biogenesis, we used a variety of approaches, including in vitro kinase assays, confocal and electron microscopy, as well as in vivo subcutaneous and orthotopic\u00a0breast cancer mouse\u00a0models. Here, we report that LMTK3 increases the average size of EVs, modulates immunoregulatory EV proteomic cargo and alters the subpopulation distribution of EVs released by breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that LMTK3 phosphorylates Rab7, a key regulator of multivesicular body (MVB) trafficking, thereby reducing the fusion of MVBs with lysosomes and subsequent degradation of intralumenal vesicles, resulting in altered EV release. Moreover, LMTK3 causes increased packaging of phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) in EVs, leading to a paracrine upregulation of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) in monocytes when these EVs are taken up. PSAT1 and PHGDH play key roles in the serine biosynthesis pathway, which is closely linked to cancer progression and regulation of monocyte behaviour. LMTK3 EV-induced elevated PHGDH expression in monocytes reduces their infiltration into breast cancer 3D spheroids and in vivo breast cancer\u00a0mouse models. Furthermore, these infiltrating monocytes preferentially differentiate into pro-tumourigenic M2-like macrophages. Additional breast cancer mouse studies highlight the contribution of LMTK3-dependent EVs in the observed\u00a0immunosuppressive macrophage phenotype.\u00a0Finally, in vitro experiments show that pharmacological\u00a0inhibition of LMTK3 reverses the pro-tumourigenic and immunomodulatory effects mediated by EVs\u00a0derived from LMTK3 overexpressing cells. Overall, this study advances our knowledge on the mechanisms of EV biogenesis and highlights a novel oncogenic role of LMTK3 in the breast TME, further supporting it as a target for cancer therapy.",

For patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), next-generation sequencing (NGS) may identify those with Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) who may benefit from Poly ADP [adenosine diphosphate]-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARP) inhibition therapy. Ongoing questions remain, however, regarding how patients and clinicians can best select therapies to optimize patient outcomes. In this case report, we highlight a patient with rapidly progressive mCRPC with germline BRCA2 for whom olaparib was added with abiraterone and prednisone resulting in a significant but brief response. Using next-generation sequencing of a liquid biopsy, we identified Protein Phosphatase 1D (PPM1D) as a potential resistance mechanism to PARP inhibition. While this alteration has been previously reported in other tumor types, the role of PPM1D and its contribution to PARP inhibitor resistance in mCRPC has not been described; the aim of this report was to highlight the potential role it may play in prostate cancer. With the increasing availability of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to assist clinicians with monitoring patients' responses on therapy, the results from this case study underscore the necessity of exploring optimal timing of liquid and/or repeat tumor biopsies to help longitudinally personalize targeted therapy to improve patient outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with no targeted treatment modalities. Currently, combination chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy are options for many TNBC patients; however, their efficacy is limited. Understanding what makes TNBCs responsive to immune therapy is crucial for improving patient outcomes. We investigated the role of MerTK expression in TNBC using syngeneic and immunodeficient mouse models, human and murine cells lines, and human clinical samples. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, RNA, multiplex ELISA, immunohistochemistry and multiplex immunofluorescence analysis were used to probe the effects of MerTK expression on the tumor immune microenvironment. Overexpression of MerTK in TNBC syngeneic mouse models leads to a marked delay in tumor growth, coupled with significant increases in anti-tumor M1 macrophage, CD4+ T cell, active CD8+ T cell, active NK cell, and NKT cell populations. This increase in pro-inflammatory cells contrasted with decreased anti-inflammatory polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the TIME. In addition, tumors overexpressing MerTK exhibited very high sensitivity to both aPDL1 and aCTLA4 therapies, leading to durable tumor control and, in some cases, complete tumor regression without recurrence. Further, using Vectra multispectral analysis, elevated MerTK expression in human clinical samples was associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory immune cells. In vivo and human clinical data suggest that tumor-bound MerTK expression is independent of PD-L1 expression in TNBC. These preclinical findings indicate that MerTK could serve as an independent predictive biomarker for ICI response in TNBC, potentially expanding the cohort of late-stage TNBC patients eligible for ICI therapy while reducing toxicity in early-stage patients by treating only those predicted to respond.",

Our analysis supported development of a unique HERV scoring algorithm that segregated GBM, LGG, and NB. Interestingly, lower HERV scores showed correlation with lower survival in GBM. However, HERV scores were less robust in predicting LGG survival or LGG progression to GBM. Functional prediction analysis linked the 211 HERV loci with 18 voltage-gated potassium channel genes.

          "abstract": "The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides comprehensive genomic data across various cancer types. However, complex file naming conventions and the necessity of linking disparate data types to individual case IDs can be challenging for first-time users. While other tools have been introduced to facilitate TCGA data handling, they lack a straightforward combination of all required steps. To address this, we developed a streamlined pipeline using the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) portal's cart system for file selection and the GDC Data Transfer Tool for data downloads. We use the Sample Sheet provided by the GDC portal to replace the default 36-character opaque file IDs and filenames with human-readable case IDs. We developed a pipeline integrating customizable Python scripts in a Jupyter Notebook and a Snakemake pipeline for ID mapping along with automating data preprocessing tasks (https://github.com/alex-baumann-ur/TCGADownloadHelper). Our pipeline simplifies the data download process by modifying manifest files to focus on specific subsets, facilitating the handling of multimodal data sets related to single patients. The pipeline essentially reduced the effort required to preprocess data. Overall, this pipeline enables researchers to efficiently navigate the complexities of TCGA data extraction and preprocessing. By establishing a clear step-by-step approach, we provide a streamlined methodology that minimizes errors, enhances data usability, and supports the broader utilization of TCGA data in cancer research. It is particularly beneficial for researchers new to genomic data analysis, offering them a practical framework prior to conducting their TCGA studies.",

          "abstract": "Mutations in <i>TP53</i>, particularly the p.R248Q variant, contribute to the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) by reshaping the tumor microenvironment (TME). This study examined the impact of p.R248Q (mutp53) on immune suppression and CRPC progression. We introduced the <i>Trp53</i> p.R245Q mutation into RM-1 mouse prostate cancer (PCa) cells via CRISPR/Cas9, which mimics human <i>TP53</i> p.R248Q. These cells were implanted into C57BL/6 mice to model tumor progression and immune interactions. Mice were treated with JAK2 and STAT3 inhibitors to assess immune and tumor responses. Tumor behavior and immune responses were analyzed via histology, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and bioinformatics. Findings were validated in the C4-2 human PCa cell line. Compared with wild-type p53, <i>TP53</i> mutations were present in 27% of PCa patients and were significantly correlated with reduced overall survival (p < 0.001, HR = 1.97) and recurrence-free survival (p = 0.02, HR = 1.62). The p.R248Q mutation was most prevalent. Gene-edited mutp53 cells exhibited increased proliferation and tumorigenicity. Screening and validation confirmed that IL6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway activation in mutp53 tumors led to immune microenvironment alterations. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence revealed an immunosuppressive profile, with decreased proinflammatory cytokines and elevated anti-inflammatory factors. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed that mutp53 competes with SHP1 for STAT3 binding, sustaining its activation. Inhibition of STAT3 reduced mutp53-driven immune suppression and tumor progression. Mutp53 promotes an immunosuppressive TME and facilitates CRPC progression through the STAT3 pathway, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target.",

          "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive disease with limited approved therapeutic options. The rapid growth and genomic instability of TNBC cells make mitosis a compelling target, and a current mainstay of treatment is paclitaxel (Ptx), a taxane that stabilizes microtubules during mitosis. While initially effective, acquired resistance to Ptx is common, and other antimitotic therapies can be similarly rendered ineffective due to the development of resistance or systemic toxicity, underscoring the need for new therapeutic approaches. Interrogating CRISPR essentiality screens in TNBC cell lines, we identified PAFAH1B1 (LIS1) as a potential vulnerability in this disease. PAFAH1B1 regulates mitotic spindle orientation, proliferation, and cell migration during neurodevelopment, yet little is known regarding its function in breast cancer. We found that suppressing PAFAH1B1 expression in TNBC cells reduces cell number, while non-malignant cells remain unaffected. PAFAH1B1 suppression alters cell cycle dynamics, increasing mitotic duration and accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase. The suppression of PAFAH1B1 expression also increases DNA double-strand breaks, indicating a requirement for sustained PAFAH1B1 expression to maintain the genomic integrity of TNBC cells. Finally, PAFAH1B1 silencing substantially enhances these defects in cells that are taxane-resistant and sensitizes both parental and Ptx-resistant TNBC cells to Ptx. These results indicate that LIS1/PAFAH1B1 may be a novel target for the development of new anti-mitotic agents for treating TNBC, particularly in the context of paclitaxel resistance.",

While most patients will present with an indolent disease, others will follow a highly aggressive clinical course. Currently, defining disease prognosis remains challenging. Ectopic expression of gametocyte-specific factor 1 (GTSF1) has emerged as a potential prognostic biomarker. However, its contribution to CTCL carcinogenesis remains unknown. Here, we report that GTSF1 contributes to carcinogenesis by partially modifying the memory/effector phenotype of the malignant T cells. GTSF1 knockdown in CTCL cells led to T-cell activation and production of IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1. Advanced stages of the disease are associated with decreased production of these cytokines. Notably, we show that patients classified with high expression of GTSF1 are associated with a worse disease prognosis. Taken together, our findings indicate that GTSF1 expression in CTCL cells allows them to acquire memory T-cell phenotype. Malignant memory T cells have a decreased production of immune-responsive cytokines, leading to a diminished immune response and disease progression. GTSF1 is an important candidate as a prognostic biomarker. Furthermore, understanding the specific function of GTSF1 might help develop novel targeted treatment options for CTCL patients.",

          "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Melanoma remains a difficult malignancy to treat because it employs tolerance mechanisms like negative immune checkpoint (IC) molecules to avoid antitumor immune responses. Thus, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are increasingly used to treat melanoma. However, many patients do not respond, indicating resistance mechanisms like intrinsic tumor characteristics and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). An inflamed TME was associated with improved ICI efficacy by upregulating the T-cell inflamed TME gene signatures, an array of genes associated with dendritic cells (DCs) and cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated anti-tumor responses. As histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been shown to play crucial roles in regulating gene expression and aberrant HDAC expression has been reported in melanoma and also implicated in the regulation of IC, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and its ligand (PD-L1) and various immune evasion genes, we investigated the relationship between T-cell inflamed TME gene signatures and the HDAC family, particularly HDAC4. <b>Methods</b>: We used the skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) database, ICI-pretreated melanoma dataset, and other platforms including cBioPortal, TIMER 2.0, TISIDB, and UALCAN for the analysis. <b>Results</b>: We identified that high HDAC4 expression negatively modulated the TME by decreasing the abundance of DCs and cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. The group of melanoma patients with elevated HDAC4 expression exhibited not only poor prognosis but also diminished transcription of T-cell inflamed TME gene signatures and increased DNA methylation of T-cell inflamed TME gene signatures. Importantly, elevated HDAC4 expression was associated with decreased CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and a decreased ESTIMATE immune score in ICI-pretreated melanoma patients. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our findings suggest that HDAC4 may transform the TME into a non-inflamed phenotype, thereby reducing ICI efficacy in melanoma. Overall, this research shows that a combination of HDAC4 inhibitors and ICIs could result in better melanoma prognosis.",

Significant clinical heterogeneity of these malignancies has been highlighted among poorly differentiated histotypes and within the subgroup of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET). Currently, the main prognostic factors of lung NET include stage, histotype, grade, peripheral location, and demographic parameters. To gain deeper insights into the genomic underpinnings of lung NETs, we conducted a pilot investigation to uncover potential genetic mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) implicated in their pathogenesis. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded intraoperative tumor biopsies and matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples were collected from six consecutive patients with lung NETs. The whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed to profile germline and somatic mutations, identify novel genetic alterations, and detect CNVs. Clinical and pathological data were systematically documented at diagnosis and during follow-up. The WES analysis identified a subset of mutations shared between germline and somatic; some were of particular clinical interest as they were associated with tumor proliferation and potential therapeutic targets such as the genes KDM5C, ATR, COL7A1, NOTCH4, PTPRS, SMO, SPEN, SPTA1, TAF1. These mutations were predominantly linked to chromatin remodeling and were involved in critical oncogenic pathways such as Notch and Wnt signaling. This pilot study highlights the potential role of NGS analysis on solid biopsy in the assessment of the mutational profile of lung NET. A comparison of germline and somatic mutations is critical to identifying putative tumor driver mutations. In perspective, the enrichment of a subpopulation of cancer cells in the blood, with one or more specific mutations, is information of enormous clinical relevance, either for prognosis or therapeutic decisions. Translational studies on large prospective series are required to establish the role of liquid biopsy in lung NET.",

However, surgeons often face challenges regarding optimal surgical timing, extent of surgery, and identifying patients at risk for metastasis or progression to more aggressive subtypes. The ongoing debate over immediate surgery versus active surveillance emphasizes the need for reliable, minimally invasive diagnostic tools to inform surgical decision-making. This study aims to develop an epigenetic biomarker-based prediction system using fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) samples to assess PTC aggressiveness preoperatively. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of methylome data to identify approximately 7200 CpG islands with altered methylation levels in thyroid cancer tissues. These candidate regions were further examined in our cohort of 55 PTC patients to develop methylation-specific primers suitable for FNAB samples. Methylation patterns allowed us to stratify patients into two distinct prognostic groups, one of which exhibited a poorer survival rate. Our methylation-specific primers effectively classified FNAB samples into these groups, demonstrating their potential as a preoperative tool for assessing tumor aggressiveness. This stratification aids in informing surgical planning and personalizing treatment strategies. DNA methylation profiling of PTC identifies key epigenetic biomarkers associated with tumor aggressiveness. Utilizing these biomarkers in FNAB samples provides a minimally invasive method for preoperative risk assessment, assisting surgeons in tailoring surgical interventions and potentially improving patient outcomes.",

          "abstract": "A common barrier to the development of effective anticancer agents is the development of drug resistance. This obstacle remains a challenge to successful clinical translation, particularly for targeted agents. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitors represent a clinically applicable drug class that exploits the increased dependence of cancer cells on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>), a coenzyme essential to metabolism and other cellular functions. NAMPT catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway of mammalian cells and is overexpressed in numerous types of cancers. Preclinical research has demonstrated that pharmacological targeting of NAMPT may be an effective strategy against certain cancers, and while several early-phase clinical trials testing NAMPT inhibitors in refractory cancers have been completed, drug resistance is a concern. Preclinical work in a variety of cancer models has demonstrated the emergence of resistance to multiple NAMPT inhibitors through several recurrent mechanisms. This review represents the first article summarizing the current state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of acquired drug resistance to NAMPT inhibitors with a particular focus on upregulation of the compensatory NAD<sup>+</sup> production enzymes nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT) and quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT), acquired mutations in NAMPT, metabolic reprogramming, and altered expression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporter ABCB1. An understanding of how these mechanisms interact with the biology of each given cancer cell type to predispose to the acquisition of NAMPT inhibitor resistance will be necessary to develop strategies to optimize the use of these agents moving forward.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the impact of alterations in six key genes (<i>HMGB1, ROS1, IL6, FGFR1, FGFR2</i>, and <i>TLR4</i>) on survival outcomes in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). These genes are implicated in signaling pathways such as RTK-Ras, PI3K-Akt, TLR, and SHP2. Genomic data from five datasets were merged to identify 437 ESCC patients, categorized into altered (<i>n</i> = 66, 15%) and unaltered (<i>n</i> = 371, 85%) groups. Gene expression was analyzed using the GSE53624 dataset, and survival outcomes were assessed with Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. Hazard ratios (HR) were derived to quantify risk. The altered group exhibited a significantly higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) and mutation count than the unaltered group (<i>p</i> < 1E-7). While disease-free survival analysis of 76 patients showed no significant difference, overall survival (OS) analysis of 288 patients demonstrated significantly worse survival in the altered group [median OS (95% CI): 18.63 months (18.17-28.13) vs. 40.93 months (28.42 - not reached); HR = 2.16 (1.33-3.52)]. Additionally, higher <i>HMGB1</i> expression was significantly associated with poorer survival (<i>p</i> < 0.008). Expression-treatment response correlation using the GSE45670 dataset showed that <i>HMGB1</i> expression in the pathological complete remission group was significantly higher than in the normal epithelium group, <i>p</i> = 0.016. This study highlights that genomic alterations in these six genes are associated with poorer OS in ESCC, despite higher TMB potentially increasing tumor neo-antigens. These findings underscore the need for further research to explore their prognostic and therapeutic potential.",

          "abstract": "Targeted immunotherapy can significantly improve the survival rates of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients; however, only a minority of patients respond favorably to such treatments. In this study, we investigate the association between the tumor mutational burden (TMB) and clinical characteristics of HNSCC, as well as the impact of COL11A1 gene mutations on the immune microenvironment in head and neck cancer (HNC). In our analysis of HNSCC patient data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found significant differences in TMB across various clinical features. Furthermore, a high TMB was associated with poorer survival outcomes. Despite its relatively high mutation frequency, the clinical significance of COL11A1 has not been fully explored. Our analysis of COL11A1 mutations in HNSCC and their functional impact found that COL11A1 mutations are associated with poor survival outcomes. Additionally, we observed a close correlation between COL11A1 mutations, reduced immune cell infiltration, and altered expression levels of chemokines. Further enrichment analysis suggested that COL11A1 mutations may alter the tumor immune microenvironment by affecting immune-related pathways, such as leukocyte activation and chemokine signaling. Finally, we evaluated the effect of the COL11A1 mutation on immune infiltration. Using a variety of immune infiltration algorithms, we found that the mutation of COL11A1 was associated with lower levels of immune cell infiltration. In summary, the present study explored the potential role of COL11A1 mutation in the progression of HNSCC, and our findings provide a potential therapeutic target for better therapeutic outcomes in HNSCC.",

          "abstract": "While mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency is well-characterized in several cancers, its role in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains unclear. We comprehensively assessed MMR in early-stage TNBC, examining its prevalence, clinical correlations, prognostic value, relationship with microsatellite instability (MSI), and patterns of intratumoral heterogeneity. Two early-stage TNBC cohorts were investigated for germline mutations using next-generation sequencing, protein expression by immunohistochemistry, and MSI status through molecular detection. Associations with clinicopathological characteristics and survival were examined. Results were validated using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Among 259 patients, MMR deficiency was observed in 8.2%, all showing PMS2 loss, while 2 germline PMS2 mutations (2.7%) were detected. At the somatic level, 35.8% showed heterogeneous MMR expression, more frequently in earlier stages (IA-IIA 41.4% vs. IIB-III 22.4%, p\u2009=\u20090.04) and smaller tumors (cT1-2 39.1% vs. cT3-4 18.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.01). MMR status showed no significant associations with other clinicopathological variables or survival. No MSI was detected in MMR-deficient cases. The 5-year recurrence rate was 16.0% (95% CI 10.0-24.0) for MMR-intact, 20.0% (95% CI 4.5-43.0) for MMR-deficient, and 17.9% (95% CI 9.8-28.1) for heterogeneous tumors (p\u2009=\u20090.75). Pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was similar across MMR status groups. These findings were consistent with analyses using TCGA data. MMR system shows a low rate of alterations in TNBC, with its deficiency being infrequent and not correlated with MSI. Although MMR system isolated evaluation may not be justified in early-stage TNBC due to its limited clinical impact, its inclusion in multigene panels should be further considered.",

However, expression pattern and possible role and mechanism of FUNDC2 in pan-cancer remain to be investigated. TIMER 2.0 was used to investigate the expression patterns and immune infiltration of FUNDC2. GEPIA was applied to study the relationship between level of FUNDC2 and prognosis of the patients with pan-cancer. STRING was employed to analyze the potential interacting proteins of FUNDC2. The phosphorylation sites were predicted by cBioPortal and PhosphoNet. Furthermore, variations of FUNDC2 in cancers were investigated by cBioPortal. Finally, AlphaFold was used to predict the structure of FUNDC2. The data show that there were significant differences in the expression levels of FUNDC2 between cancer tissues and controls. Specifically, the levels of FUNDC2 in 8 cancers were significantly lower than the respective controls. The survival time of the cancer patients with higher levels of FUNDC2 was longer than that of lower FUNDC2 in most different types of cancers. The pattern of FUNDC2 was significantly related to immune infiltration of B cells of cancer patients. STRING analysis revealed that FUNDC2 can interact with FUNDC1, et al. Fifteen phosphorylation sites were predicted by PhosphoNet and cBioPortal, of which the S167 also overlapped with the mutation sites of FUNDC2. These data collectively show that the mitochondrial protein FUNDC2 may serve as a possible prognostic biomarker across various cancers and the mechanism may include immune infiltration.",

          "abstract": "The six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate (STEAP; STEAP1 and STEAP2) metalloreductases are therapeutic targets for advanced prostate cancer, and their expression has been linked to androgen receptor (AR) signaling; however, the regulatory mechanism and functions of STEAP1 and STEAP2 in prostate cancer progression remain elusive. In this study, we explore how in vitro androgen modulation and AR inhibition influence the expression of STEAP family members in cell lines with varying reliance on androgen signaling. Our data show that in response to androgen deprivation, STEAP1 and STEAP2 exhibit elevated transcript levels, whereas STEAP4 levels are reduced, mirroring the expression profile of kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3). As STEAP1 and STEAP2 are implicated in the exocytic pathway, we evaluated expression profiles in small extracellular vesicles (sEV) released from prostate cancer cells and in circulating sEVs. STEAP1, but not STEAP2, is upregulated in sEVs from AR-negative cells, which express low cellular STEAP1, and AR-positive cells, which express high cellular STEAP1. These results indicate selective packaging of STEAP1 in prostate cancer cell-derived sEVs, irrespective of AR status and cellular STEAP1 expression levels. Finally, ex vivo analysis of circulating sEVs from genetically engineered mice carrying prostate cancer shows that STEAP1 is found in the sEV cargo and that its levels are independent of protumorigenic \u03b21 integrin expression in the prostatic epithelium. Understanding how androgen dependence affects STEAP1 expression in both tumor cells and sEVs across distinct disease stages will illuminate the clinical benefit of combinatorial AR and STEAP1-directed therapies and inform the optimal placement of STEAP1 targeting within the prostate cancer disease continuum.",

This is a major problem of public health since it will become the second leading cause of death by cancer in the next few years, mainly due to the lack of efficient therapies. Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channel Subfamily M Member 7 (TRPM7) protein, a cation channel fused with a serine/threonine kinase domain is overexpressed in PDAC and associated with a low survival. In this work, we aim to study the role of kinase domain on pancreatic cell fates by using a model of kinase domain deletion by CRISPR-Cas9. PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 PDAC cell lines were used and kinase domain was deleted by CRISPR-Cas9 strategy. Kinase domain deletion (\u0394K) was validated by RT-qPCR and western blots. The effect of kinase domain deletion on channel function was studied by patch-clamp and Mn<sup>2+</sup>-quenching. The cell phenotype was studied by MTT and cell migration/invasion assays. Finally, the role of kinase domain was studied in vivo in xenografted mice. Here we show that TRPM7 kinase domain is required to maintain a mesenchymal phenotype in PDAC cells. We also demonstrated that TRPM7 and PAK1 interact in the same protein complexes. Moreover, TRPM7 kinase domain is required for carcinogenesis and cancer cell dissemination in vivo. Intriguingly, the role of TRPM7 kinase is cell specific and may depend on the KRAS oncogene mutation status. In conclusion, TRPM7 kinase domain is required to maintain a mesenchymal and aggressive phenotype in PDAC cells, and it could be a promising target against PDAC.",

The emergence of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) exemplifies the complex disease management for PCa. PARP inhibitors (PARPis) are being tested to treat mCRPC in tumors with defective homologous recombination repair (HRR) to address this complexity. However, increasing resistance towards PARPi in HRR-deficient patients and the low percentage of HRR-defective mCRPC patients requires the identification of new genes whose deficiency can be exploited for PARPi treatment. XRCC1 is a DNA repair protein critical in the base excision repair (BER) and single strand break repair (SSBR) pathways. We analyzed PCa patients' cohorts and found that XRCC1 expression varies widely, with many patients showing low XRCC1 expression. We created XRCC1 deficiency in PCa models to examine PARPi sensitivity. XRCC1 loss conferred hypersensitivity to PARPi by promoting the accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks, increasing cell-cycle arrest, and inducing apoptosis. We confirmed that XRCC1 expression correlated with PARPi sensitivity using a doxycycline-inducible system. Therefore, we conclude that XRCC1 expression level predicts response to PARPi, and the clinical utility of PARPi in PCa can extend to low XRCC1 expressing tumors.",

Traditional grading systems rely on subjective expert judgment and require extensive pathological expertise, are time-consuming, and often lead to inter-observer variability. To address these limitations, we develop an AI-based model to predict Nottingham grade from whole-slide images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained breast cancer tissue using a pathology foundation model. From TCGA database, we trained and evaluated using 521\u00a0H&E breast cancer slide images with available Nottingham scores through internal split validation, and further validated its clinical utility using an additional set of 597 cases without Nottingham scores. The model leveraged deep features extracted from a pathology foundation model (UNI) and incorporated 14 distinct multiple instance learning (MIL) algorithms. The best-performing model achieved an F1 score of 0.731 and a multiclass average AUC of 0.835. The top 300 genes correlated with model predictions were significantly enriched in pathways related to cell division and chromosome segregation, supporting the model's biological relevance. The predicted grades demonstrated statistically significant association with 5-year overall survival (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Our AI-based automated Nottingham grading system provides an efficient and reproducible tool for breast cancer assessment, offering potential for standardization of histologic grade in clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer (BCa), a leading malignancy among women, is characterized by morphological and molecular heterogeneity. While early-stage, hormone receptor, and HER2-positive BCa are treatable, triple-negative BCa and metastatic BCa remains largely untreatable. Advances in sequencing and proteomic technologies have improved our understanding of the molecular alterations that occur during BCa initiation and progression and enabled identification of subclass-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Despite the availability of abundant omics data in public repositories, user-friendly tools for multi-omics data analysis and integration are scarce. To address this, we developed a comprehensive BCa data analysis platform called MammOnc-DB ( http://resource.path.uab.edu/MammOnc-Home.html ), comprising data from more than 20,000 BCa samples. MammOnc-DB facilitates hypothesis generation and testing, biomarker discovery, and therapeutic targets identification. The platform also includes pre- and post-treatment data, which can help users identify treatment resistance markers and support combination therapy strategies, offering researchers and clinicians a comprehensive tool for BCa data analysis and visualization.",

          "abstract": "Mendelian histonopathies are rare neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) caused by germline variants in histone-encoding genes. Here, we perform a more expansive pan-histonopathy interrogation than previously possible. We analyze data from 192 individuals affected by histonopathies. This analysis includes representation of the 185 published individuals with HIST1H1E syndrome, Bryant-Li-Bhoj syndrome, and Tessadori-Bicknell-van Haaften NDD; as well as from seven unpublished individuals, five of whom harbor variants in genes not previously associated with disease (HIST1H2AL/H2AC16, H2AFZ/H2AZ1, HIST1H3D/H3C4, and HIST3H3/H3-4). By intersecting clinician-reported phenotypic data with next-generation phenotyping of published 2D facial photographs (n = 98), we sought to address the lack of established craniofacial gestalts or characteristic phenotypic patterns for this community. While these analyses may suggest a histone core versus linker protein basis of delineation, they more strikingly highlight data gaps that confound the identification of phenotypic patterns at this time. Based on this, we developed an updated standardized clinical survey, which allowed us to identify the second known individual with a germline histonopathy and a cancer diagnosis. Notably, the community-wide cancer incidence is currently 1%, which falls below the recommended 5% cut off for routine surveillance. Ultimately, this work highlights the ways in which histonopathy-associated phenotypes change throughout the lifespan, necessitating longitudinal re-evaluation; that every identified individual shapes our understanding of these syndromes in a way that improves care for this community; and the value of ongoing translational work to address the outstanding question of cancer predisposition for individuals living with germline histonopathies.",

In our mouse model assays, RCC243 cells formed metastatic tumors, and all tumors retained clear cell morphology irrespective of model type. Notably, gene expression profiles differed markedly between the RCC243 tumor models-cell culture, orthotopic tumors, and metastatic tumors-suggesting an impact of the experimental model system and whether the tumor was orthotopic or metastatic. Furthermore, we found conserved prognostic markers between RCC243 tumor models and human ccRCC patient datasets, and genes upregulated in metastatic RCC243 were associated with worse patient outcomes.",

Despite numerous studies suggesting its involvement in cancer, a definitive role remains unclear. We introduce the first comprehensive meta-analysis and\u00a0pan-cancer\u00a0bioinformatics study on ANGPTL4, aiming to unravel its implications across various cancer types. Moderate-to high-quality observational studies were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. A meta-analysis was conducted using the R package \"meta.\" Survival analysis was performed using GEPIA2 and TIMER2.0. Immune infiltration, mutational burden, and drug resistance analyses was done via GSCAlite. Co-expression and gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) were carried out using cBioportal and enrichr, respectively. Increased ANGPTL4 expression was linked to worse tumor grade (OR =\u2009 1.51, P\u2009= 0.023), stage (OR =\u2009 2.42, P\u2009<\u20090.001), lymph node metastasis (OR =\u2009 1.76, P\u2009=\u20090.012), vascular invasion (OR =\u2009 2.16, P\u2009=\u20090.01), and lymphatic invasion (OR =\u2009 2.20, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Furthermore, ANGPTL4 expression was linked to worse OS (HR\u2009= 1.40, 95% CI: 1.29,1.50, P\u2009=\u20090.0001). Single gene level analysis revealed that ANGPTL4 upregulated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in 23 different cancers. Immune infiltration varied between cancer types, but increased infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts was observed in most cancers. Mutation analysis revealed increased alterations in TP53 and CDKN2A in cohorts with ANGPTL4 alterations. GSEA of co-expressed genes revealed involvement in hypoxia, EMT, VEGF-A complex, TGF-B pathways, and extracellular matrix organization. ANGPTL4 plays a significant role in tumor progression via its positive regulation of EMT and angiogenesis, while possibly harboring a TGF-B dependent role in systemic metastasis. Therefore, ANGPTL4 is a suitable target for future drug development.",

There are limited data on the genomic profile and its predictive potential for response to immunotherapy with PD-1 inhibitors in cSCC. This study retrospectively reviewed cSCC patients treated with PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy at a single institution. Clinical characteristics, treatment outcomes, PD-L1 expression, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and genomic profile in tumor and blood were analyzed. Logistic regression and a support vector classifier were used to validate identified biomarkers of significance. Twenty-five patients were evaluable for response and had genomics tested in tumor and/or blood. Of the total, 80% of patients achieved an objective response: 40% complete response (CR), 32% partial response (PR) for more than 6 months, and 8% stable disease (SD) for more than 1 year; 20% of patients progressed on treatment. With a median follow-up of 21 months, progression-free survival (PFS) was 28 months in responders vs. 3 months in non-responders (<i>p</i> = 0.00001). Median PD-L1 was 25% in responders vs. 10% in non-responders (<i>p</i> = 0.39). There was no difference in median TMB between responders and non-responders. Eight gene mutations were significantly more frequent in non-responders than in responders: <i>CDK12</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.005), <i>CTCF</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.033), <i>CTNNB1</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.033), <i>IGF1R</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.038), <i>IKBKE</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.016), <i>MLH1</i> (0.033), <i>QKI</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.016), and <i>TIPARP</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.033). A support vector model of these genes classified responders and non-responders with an accuracy of 0.88 in the training data and 1.0 in the testing data. PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy produces an impressive response. Eight gene mutations were significantly more frequent in non-responders. PD-L1 and TMB were inconclusive in predicting treatment response to anti-PD-L1.",

Despite advances in treating high-risk PC, the clinical outcomes and molecular underpinnings of GS 10 remain unclear. This study aimed to determine whether GS 10 PC has distinct clinical outcomes from other \"high-risk\" cancers (i.e., Gleason 8-9) and identify genomic alterations driving its aggressive phenotype. <b>Methods</b>: A retrospective review of The Cancer Genome Atlas database identified patients with GS 8-10 PC who underwent radical prostatectomy. Clinical factors were compared between GS 10 and GS 8-9 cohorts. Time to biochemical recurrence (BCR) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression. RNA sequencing identified differentially expressed genes, and protein-protein interaction networks identified hub genes. <b>Results</b>: Of 192 patients, 13 (6.8%) had GS 10 PC. After median follow-up of 37.87 months, GS 10 status was associated with significantly lower time to BCR (AHR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.18-6.02; <i>p</i> = 0.018) compared to GS 8-9. Multiple genes (e.g., <i>RAD54L</i>, <i>FAAH</i>, <i>AATK</i>, <i>MAST2</i>) showed higher alteration frequencies, and high expression of <i>RAD54L</i>, <i>MAST2</i>, and <i>CCHCR1</i> correlated with shorter disease-free survival. Six overlapping hub genes (<i>CD8A</i>, <i>CDC20</i>, <i>E2F1</i>, <i>IL10</i>, <i>TNF</i>, <i>VCAM1</i>) were overexpressed in GS 10 tumors, reflecting key pathways in tumor progression. <b>Conclusions</b>: GS 10 PC confers inferior time to BCR and displays a distinct genomic landscape compared to GS 8-9 disease, highlighting the need for biomarker-driven therapeutic strategies. Further studies are needed to validate these genomic targets and improve management for this very high-risk population.",

Besides, PC patients have encountered resistance to recent therapeutic approaches. In recent work, we effectively determined ANKRD22 by re-analyzing RNA-seq datasets from cell lines and human tissues deriving from PC. We demonstrated that ANKRD22 expression was remarkably high in the PC group compared to the normal group at both gene expression and protein levels. ANKRD22 resulted in a worse overall survival (OS) rate of PC patients (HR = 1.7, p = 0.0082). Intriguingly, ANKRD22 was statistically highly expressed in the mutated KRAS group relative to the wildtype group (p < 0.05). Similarly, compared to the wildtype TP53, in the mutated TP53, ANKRD22 also significantly expressed (p < 0.05); their concurrent expression, ANKRD22 and KRAS; ANKRD22 and TP53 exacerbated the survival outcome relative to the co-expression of low ANKRD22 and unaltered genes (p < 0.001; HR > 2.6). We explored the potential pathways and biological processes ANKRD22 might not only contribute to promoting PC, including cell-cycle regulation, E2F1 targets, and apoptosis but also foster the dissemination of PC by involve in invasion and migration processes. In the investigation of drugs that might target ANKRD22, we figured out fostamatinib. Molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation (MDs) techniques provided extensive insights into the binding mode of ANKRD22 and fostamatinib. ANKRD22 exhibited strong binding affinity (\u0394G = -7.0 kcal/mol in molecular docking and \u2206G<sub>bind</sub> = -38.66 \u00b1 6.09 kcal/mol in MDs). Taken together, ANKRD22 could be a promising theragnostic target that might be inhibited by fostamatinib, thereby suppressing PC growth.",

          "abstract": "Dysfunction or aberrant expression of DEAD-box RNA helicases might play a role in the initiation and progression of human cancers. Nevertheless, the key regulator and underlying molecular mechanism have yet to be fully elucidated in ovarian cancer. This study identified DDX39A as one of the prominently upregulated genes in ovarian cancer through a systematic analysis of RNA helicase expression profiles using the CPTAC and TCGA ovarian cancer datasets. High expression of DDX39A was confirmed in paraffin-embedded ovarian cancer samples. Specifically, elevated DDX39A expression was found to be associated with poor overall survival in ovarian cancer patients. Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated DDX39A silencing led to a decrease in the proliferation capacity of a CDX model and a PDX model. Furthermore, DDX39A expression is regulated by the splicing factor SNRPB. SNRPB depletion or DDX39A knockdown induced the retention of DDX39A introns 6 and 8 to generate the noncoding transcript DDX39A-209, which yielded premature termination codons and resulted in nonsense-mediated RNA decay and decreased expression of the DDX39A protein. DDX39A silencing reduced the proliferative and metastatic capacities of SNRPB-overexpressing cells, indicating that DDX39A mediates the oncogenic function of SNRPB in ovarian cancer cells. In addition, RNA-Seq data analysis revealed that DDX39A promotes the proliferation and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells through the regulation of exon skipping of ITGA6 to produce the oncogenic ITGA6A transcript. These findings suggest that the SNRPB/DDX39A/ITGA6 axis plays critically important role in the progression of ovarian cancer, which increases our understanding of the role of DEAD-box RNA helicases and provides a viable therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.",

The use of variational inference (VI) in its training allows the model to outperform competitors in terms of computational time and scalability, while maintaining high accuracy. VICatMix furthermore performs variable selection, enhancing its performance on high-dimensional, noisy data. The proposed model incorporates summarization and model averaging to mitigate poor local optima in VI, allowing for improved estimation of the true number of clusters simultaneously with feature saliency. We demonstrate the performance of VICatMix with both simulated and real-world data, including applications to datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas, showing its use in cancer subtyping and driver gene discovery. We demonstrate VICatMix's potential utility in integrative cluster analysis with different 'omics datasets, enabling the discovery of novel disease subtypes.

Our comprehensive analysis examined <i>BRAF</i> alterations [point mutations, structural variants (SVs) and copy number alteration] in more than 217,000 tumor samples across 120 distinct tumor types from primary and metastatic sites in both adult and pediatric cohorts, focusing on mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence of mutations in other oncogenes or tumor suppressors. The work also explores the association of <i>BRAF</i> somatic alterations with survival, clinical and molecular features. <b>Results:</b> Analysis of mutation frequencies across cancer types revealed that BRAFV600E represents approximately 90% of all <i>BRAF</i> alterations. While melanoma and thyroid carcinoma show the highest prevalence of <i>BRAF</i> mutations, followed by colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer in terms of absolute number of patients harboring <i>BRAF</i> mutations worldwide, notably high mutation frequencies were identified in rare malignancies, including hairy-cell leukemia, ganglioglioma, and serous borderline ovarian tumors. The comprehensive analysis of genomic profiling data across these tumors uncovered distinct patterns of co-occurring and mutually exclusive alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, illuminating resistance mechanisms and suggesting novel therapeutic combinations. <b>Conclusion:</b> Comprehensive genomic profiling is critical for optimizing targeted therapy and overcoming drug resistance in <i>BRAF</i>-mutated cancers. The identification of co-occurring alterations provides opportunities for rational combination therapies, emphasizing the importance of detailed mutation profiling in developing effective treatment strategies across diverse cancer types.",

          "abstract": "Neuraminidase-1 (NEU1) is an enzyme that breaks down sialic acids on glycoproteins and glycolipids. Aberrant expression of NEU1 has been linked to the progression of numerous malignancies, including liver cancer. Oseltamivir phosphate (OP) is a drug used to treat and prevent influenza, which specifically inhibits NEU1. However, the molecular mechanisms of NEU1 in liver cancer and the potential therapeutic effects of OP remain largely unclear. NEU1 expression in liver cancer was evaluated using public databases and validated in our samples. CRISPR/Cas9, CCK-8 assay, transwell assays, oil red O staining, RNA-sequencing, immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and <i>in vivo</i> experiments were used to investigate the biological function of NEU1 and the therapeutic effect of OP in liver cancer. We demonstrated that NEU1 expression was significantly elevated in liver cancer cells and tumor tissues. Patients with liver cancer exhibiting high levels of NEU1 expression tended to have a less favorable prognosis. NEU1 knockdown inhibited liver cancer cells proliferation, invasion and migration. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that NEU1 knockdown reduced lipid accumulation through promoting perilipin 2 (PLIN2)-mediated lipophagy. Notably, OP (NEU1 inhibitor), promoted lipophagy, thereby inhibiting liver cancer proliferation and tumorigenesis. Moreover, liver cancer cells were more sensitive to OP compared to other chemotherapeutics, like 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine, with a reduced drug resistance. OP inhibits liver cancer progression by targeting NEU1 and inducing lipophagy through the suppression of PLIN2. Our findings provide new directions on the role of NEU1 in liver cancer and offer latent strategies to address the chemotherapy-induced drug resistance.",

          "abstract": "Nitroalkenes are endogenous products generated by the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids. They are generated under oxidative stress conditions, mediating important anti-inflammatory signaling activities through covalent modification of protein cysteine thiols. Despite being cytoprotective in benign tissue, nitroalkenes display single-agent anti-proliferative activity in breast cancer cells and sensitize them to multiple DNA-damaging agents. Initial mechanistic evidence suggested that nitroalkene anti-cancer activities are partially mediated by inhibition of homologous recombination (HR) through the recombinase RAD51 at Cys319. However, nitroalkenes are multi-target agents, and thus, it is likely that other important DNA repair targets beyond RAD51 are modified by nitroalkenes, contributing to their anti-cancer effects. We, therefore, conducted a global proteomics analysis to address this question. This analysis led to the identification of the recQ helicase RECQL4 with a nitro-alkylation at Cys1052. This modification was further confirmed by click chemistry-based chemoproteomics and determined to be DNA damage-dependent. Functional analyses demonstrated that nitroalkene modification inhibits RECQL4 ATP-dependent helicase activity and disrupts DSB end resection and downstream homology-dependent repair. Furthermore, experiments with C1052S mutant RECQL4 revealed that RECQL4 is a major mediator of nitroalkene effects on end resection, DSB formation, and repair. The evidence presented here denotes RECQL4 as an important nitroalkene target conferring DSB repair inhibition and supports further evaluation of nitroalkenes as therapeutic agents in RECQL4-amplified cancers.",

While initially characterised in bone development, emerging evidence suggests its involvement in cancer, particularly breast cancer metastasis to bone. Osterix protein expression was evaluated in 1340 early-stage invasive breast tumours by immunohistochemistry. Cytoplasmic and nuclear expression levels were assessed and associations with clinicopathological variables and patient survival determined. Additionally, SP7 mRNA expression was examined in the METABRIC cohort of patients. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to explore the role of osterix in the hallmarks of cancer genesets. Results revealed significant associations between reduced nuclear osterix protein expression and adverse clinicopathological features, including larger tumour size, higher grade, and poor Nottingham Prognostic Index. Low nuclear osterix protein expression was also linked to shorter breast cancer-specific survival and distant metastasis free survival, particularly in patients with HER2 positive tumours. No associations were found between SP7 mRNA expression and clinicopathological variables or survival outcomes. GSEA identified enrichment of genes involved in KRAS signaling in tumours with high SP7 expression. These data suggest that reduced nuclear expression of osterix is associated with poor clinical outcome of breast cancer patients and may be of clinical relevance.",

We show that catalytic efficiency of D2HG production is greater in IDH1 R132Q than R132H mutants, and expression of IDH1 R132Q in cellular and xenograft models leads to higher D2HG concentrations in cells, tumors, and sera compared to R132H. Though expression of IDH1 R132Q leads to hypermethylation in DNA damage pathways, DNA hypomethylation is more notable when compared to IDH1 R132H expression. Transcriptome analysis shows increased expression of many pro-tumor pathways upon expression of IDH1 R132Q versus R132H, including transcripts of EGFR and PI3K signaling pathways. Thus, IDH1 mutants appear to modulate D2HG levels via altered catalysis and are associated with distinct epigenetic and transcriptomic consequences, with higher D2HG levels appearing to be associated with more aggressive tumors.",

A comprehensive analysis of DLX4 was performed, focusing on differences in expression, prognostic value, somatic mutations, methylation modifications, and immune landscapes across various cancer types using multiple databases. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were utilized to explore the potential biological functions. Additionally, we evaluated the expression profile, prognostic significance, and immune infiltration of DLX4 in Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC). The effect of DLX4 on KIRC was further validated by Spatial Transcriptomics, Real-time PCR (RT-PCR), and Immunohistochemistry experiments. DLX4 was found to be upregulated in 26 cancer types and associated with poor prognosis. It was also correlated with tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability, mismatch repair, and methylation, and was significantly enriched in pathways related to cell proliferation. In KIRC, DLX4 expression increased along with TMB and immune scores, likely due to the infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T-helper 2 (Th2) cells. Spatial transcriptomics revealed a strong correlation between DLX4 localization and tumor cells. Experimental validation confirmed that DLX4 expression is significantly upregulated in renal cancer tissues. Our study explored the mechanisms of DLX4 in pan-cancer, especially in renal clear cell carcinoma, identifying it as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target.",

We observed decreased cell proliferation and deregulation of stress-regulated pathways, including DNA repair, in ARID1A-deficient cells. Furthermore, ARID1A was linked to alternative splicing and translational regulation on RNA and interactome levels. ARID1A deficiency drastically reduced the accessibility of chromatin, especially around introns and distal enhancers, in a functional enrichment analysis. Less accessible chromatin areas were mapped to pathways such as cell proliferation and DNA damage response. Indeed, the G2/M checkpoint appeared impaired after DNA damage in ARID1A-deficient cells.

P-cadherin (CDH3), a potential therapeutic target, is highly expressed in CRC tissues and associated with poor prognosis and metastasis. However, the mechanisms underlying its role in CRC progression and its translational potential remain poorly understood. This study integrated multiple public databases (TCGA, HCMDB, UALCAN, HPA, UniProt, cBioPortal, and GEO) to evaluate CDH3 expression, construct a prognostic model, and perform functional and translational analyses. Immunohistochemistry was used to validate CDH3 protein expression in clinical samples. Additional analyses included correlations with clinicopathological parameters, immune infiltration (TIDE, TISIDB), functional enrichment (KEGG, GSEA), drug sensitivity (GSCA), and molecular docking (MOE). Single-cell sequencing (CancerSEA, HPA) was also conducted to explore CDH3's role at the single-cell level. CDH3 expression was significantly elevated in CRC tissues and correlated with poor prognosis, recurrence, and metastasis. CDH3 expression was associated with the infiltration of resting immune cells, particularly dendritic cells, and enrichment analysis revealed its critical role in CRC metastasis through extracellular matrix (ECM) and local adhesion pathways. Notably, afatinib emerged as a promising candidate for targeting CDH3 via \"drug repositioning,\" a process involving the repurposing of existing drugs for new therapeutic applications. This study provides novel insights into CDH3's role in CRC metastasis and its potential as a therapeutic target. The translational potential of CDH3, including its integration with immunotherapy and drug repositioning strategies, offers a promising avenue for the treatment of metastatic CRC.",

          "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Recent studies have identified solute carrier family 19 member 1 (SLC19A1) as a second messenger transporter that regulates massive immune-related signaling cascades, but current studies provide limited information. This study aims to evaluate its role and the potential mechanisms across various cancers. <b>Methods:</b> We analyzed multi-omics data from a pan-cancer cohort to evaluate SLC19A1 expression and its association with multiple features, including prognosis, tumor stemness, genome instability, and immune infiltration. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to validate SLC19A1 expression in tumor tissues and its relationship M2 macrophages. In addition, we used web tools such as ROCplotter to evaluate the association between SLC19A1 and response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. <b>Results:</b> SLC19A1 was found to be overexpressed in multiple cancer types compared to normal tissues, correlating with poor prognosis. High SLC19A1 levels were associated with increased genomic instability and immune suppression. In addition, SLC19A1 was negatively correlated with CD8+ T-cell infiltration and positively correlated with M2 macrophage infiltration. The association of SLC19A1 with M2 macrophages was confirmed in multiple immunofluorescence staining. Finally, SLC19A1 was associated with the response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy in a variety of tumors. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings position SLC19A1 as a novel unfavorable prognostic marker in cancer, closely linked to immune suppression and genomic instability. This study highlights the need for further exploration of SLC19A1 as a therapeutic target and its implications in cancer treatment strategies.",

          "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor-2 (TRAF2) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and scaffolding protein that contribute to the progression of various malignant tumors. However, the role of TRAF2 expression in epigenetic, cancer prognosis, and immune responses in tumor microenvironment is unclear. We used The Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database, TIMER 2.0 database, and TCGA database to evaluate TRAF2 expression in human normal and tumor tissues. Correlation of TRAF2 expression with mutations and epigenetic in tumors was evaluated using the cBioPortal platform and the GSCA database. To assess the prognostic value of TRAF2, we performed Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression analysis. LinkedOmics database was used for PANTHER Pathways enrichment analysis. The relationship between TRAF2 expression and immune checkpoint genes, as well as immune cell infiltration, was examined using TIMER 2.0 and the R language. Single-cell sequencing data and multiple immunofluorescence staining were used to observe the co-expression of TRAF2 on hepatocellular carcinoma cells and immune cells. Furthermore, using siRNA-mediated knockdown, we explored the potential role of TRAF2 in liver cancer cell biology. Our findings indicate that TRAF2 is frequently mutated and significantly overexpressed in various types of cancers, and this overexpression is linked to a poor prognosis. The epigenetic alterations in TRAF2 was significant across various types of cancers. TRAF2 is associated with the levels of various immune checkpoint genes and multiple tumor-infiltrating immune cells, suggesting its potential involvement in tumor microenvironment. Of note, enrichment analysis revealed a significant correlation between TRAF2 and T cell activation, and single-cell sequencing indicated that TRAF2 was overexpressed in malignant cells and T cells. <i>In vivo</i> results demonstrated that TRAF2 was closely associated with T lymphocytes in hepatocellular carcinoma. The results of our <i>in vitro</i> experimental studies confirmed that the loss of TRAF2 function inhibits the malignant behavior of HepG2 cells in hepatocellular carcinoma. TRAF2 represents a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy, particularly in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.",

          "abstract": "Cancers of unknown primary (CUPs) represent a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in the field of oncology. Due to the limitations of current diagnostic tools in these cases, novel approaches must be brought forward to improve treatment outcomes for these patients. The objective of this study was to develop a machine-learning-based software for primary cancer site prediction (OncoOrigin), based on genetic data acquired from tumor DNA sequencing. By design, this was an <i>in silico</i> diagnostic study, conducted using data from the cBioPortal database (accessed on 21 September 2024) and several data processing and machine learning Python libraries. The study involved over 20,000 tumor samples with information on patient age, sex, and the presence of genetic variants in over 600 genes. The main outcome of interest was machine-learning-based discrimination between cancer site classes. Model quality was assessed by training set cross-validation and evaluation on a segregated test set. Finally, the optimal model was incorporated with a graphical user interface into the OncoOrigin software. Feature importance for class discrimination was also determined on the optimal model. Out of the four tested machine learning estimators, the XGBoostClassifier-based model proved superior in test set evaluation, with a top-2 accuracy of 0.91 and ROC-AUC of 0.97. Unlike other machine learning models published in the literature, OncoOrigin stands out as the only one integrated with a graphical user interface, which is crucial for facilitating its use by oncology specialists in everyday clinical practice, where its application and implementation will have the greatest value in the future.",

In this cutting-edge review, we summarize the basic biology regulating the BCL2 family including canonical and non-canonical functions, and highlight milestones from basic research to clinical applications in cancer and other pathophysiological conditions. We review laboratory and clinical development of BH3-mimetics as well as more recent approaches including proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and tools targeting the BH4 domain of BCL2. The first BCL2-selective BH3-mimetic, venetoclax, showed remarkable efficacy with manageable toxicities and has transformed the treatment of several hematologic malignancies. Following its success, several chemically similar BCL2 inhibitors such as sonrotoclax and lisaftoclax are currently under clinical evaluation, alone and in combination. Genetic analysis highlights the importance of BCL-X<sub>L</sub> and MCL1 across different cancer types and the possible utility of BH3-mimetics targeting these proteins. However, the development of BH3-mimetics targeting BCL-X<sub>L</sub> or MCL1 has been more challenging, with on-target toxicities including thrombocytopenia for BCL-X<sub>L</sub> and cardiac toxicities for MCL1 inhibitors precluding clinical development. Tumor-specific BCL-X<sub>L</sub> or MCL1 inhibition may be achieved by novel targeting approaches using PROTACs or selective drug delivery strategies and would be transformational in many subtypes of malignancy. Taken together, we envision that the targeting of BCL2 proteins, while already a success story of translational research, may in the foreseeable future have broader clinical applicability and improve the treatment of multiple diseases.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) continues to be a major health concern with 250,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the USA, 75% of which are hormone receptor positive (HR+), expressing estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and/or the progesterone receptor (PR). Although ER-targeted therapies are available, 30% of patients will develop resistance, underscoring the need for new non-ER/estrogen-based treatments. Notably, HR+BCs exhibit poor lymphocyte infiltration and contain an immunosuppressive microenvironment, which contributes to the limited efficacy of immunotherapies in HR+BC. In this study, we demonstrate that PR/progesterone signaling reduces major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I expression, facilitating immune evasion and escape from immune-based clearance of PR+tumors. To determine the effect of PR/progesterone on MHC Class I expression, we treated human and mouse mammary tumor cell lines with progesterone and/or interferon (IFN) and measured expression of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation (APP), as well as surface MHC Class I expression. We used the OT-I/SIINFEKL model antigen system to measure the impact of progesterone on immune cell-mediated killing of modified tumor cells. We also analyzed two large BC clinical cohorts to determine how PR expression correlates with APP gene expression and MHC Class I expression in ER-positive tumors. In vitro, we show that PR/progesterone signaling reduces APP gene expression and MHC class I expression in human and breast mammary tumor cell lines. PR-mediated attenuation of APP/MHC Class I expression is more pronounced in the presence of IFN. In immune cell killing assays, PR-expressing mammary tumor cells treated with progesterone are protected from immune-mediated cytotoxicity. We demonstrate that PR expression in vivo prevents immune-mediated rejection of xenoantigen-modified mammary tumor cell lines through mechanisms involving MHC Class I expression and CD8 T cells. Data analysis of two large BC cohorts reveals lower APP gene expression and MHC Class I expression in ER/PR-positive tumors compared with ER-positive/PR-negative tumors. These findings show that HR+BCs, specifically PR+tumors, downregulate APP/MHC class I machinery through PR/progesterone signaling. Use of pharmacological PR/progesterone inhibitors may reverse these effects in patients with BC, thereby improving immunosurveillance and response to immunotherapies.",

However, retinoid resistance mechanisms limit the efficacy of these compounds. A subset of KCs expresses Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma (PRAME): a retinoid signaling corepressor. PRAME is proposed to repress retinoid signaling by guiding enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) to retinoic acid response elements (RARE) in promoters. We investigated the effects of PRAME on KC pathogenesis and retinoid response. High-PRAME expression in tumors was negatively correlated with epidermal differentiation gene signatures. PRAME overexpression downregulated epidermal differentiation gene signatures and impaired differentiation in 3D culture. PRAME overexpression attenuated retinoid-induced RARE activation, growth suppression, and differentiation responses. Conversely, low-PRAME tumors and PRAME-depleted KC cells demonstrated enriched epidermal differentiation gene signatures. PRAME downregulation restored retinoid-induced RARE activation, growth suppression, keratinization in SCC, and cell death signaling in BCC. Furthermore, combined retinoid and EZH2 inhibitor treatment augmented RARE activation and suppressed PRAME-expressing KC cell growth. Hence, PRAME confers retinoid resistance in KC, which may be overcome by EZH2 inhibition.",

We identified three novel inherited risk loci in <i>CHI3L2</i>, <i>HLA</i> class II, and <i>TERT</i> that modulate aut-mCA risk and ten novel aut-mCA-specific loci. We found specific aut-mCAs are associated with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or kidney disease incidence. High-risk aut-mCAs were associated with elevated plasma protein levels of therapeutically actionable targets: NPM1, PARP1, and TACI. Participants with multiple high-risk features such as high clonal fraction, more than one aut-mCA, and abnormal red cell morphology had a 50% cumulative incidence of blood count abnormalities over 2 years. Leveraging inherited variation, we causally established aut-mCAs as premalignant lesions for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

In addition, in vitro CCK-8 and transwell migration and invasion assays were performed to determine the biological functions of APOA1 in gastric cancer (GC) cells. The pan-cancer analysis showed that APOA1 is differentially expressed in different cancer types and significantly correlated with tumor stages. A survival analysis revealed that APOA1 predicted a poor prognosis in ACC, KIRC, STAD, and a good prognosis in BRCA, OV, and UCEC. We also found that the most common genetic alteration type of APOA1 was deep deletion, and the DNA methylation level of APOA1 decreased in various cancers. Furthermore, APOA1 expression negatively correlated with immune cells infiltration in cancers, including CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and myeloid dendritic cells. For STAD, GO/KEGG enrichment analysis revealed the possible involvement of APOA1 in cholesterol metabolism and PPAR signaling pathway. Finally, we further performed in vitro experiments to verify that overexpression of APOA1 could promote the proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells. The results of this study indicate that APOA1 is a potential tumor prognostic biomarker and immunotherapy target. In addition, APOA1 plays an essential role in the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells by vitro experiments.",

Incidence rate ratios based on gender, age, primary disease site, stage, level of education, and poverty were calculated. Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method. Mutant gene expression was obtained from the MSK-CHORD tumor registry. Overall, 48,606 Black patients were diagnosed with malignant PC between 2000 and 2020: females (53.53%) and males (46.47%). Both males and females experienced a slight increase in Annual Percent Change (APC) of PC incidence (0.24, 95% CI, -0.02-0.53) and (0.22, 95% CI, -0.05-0.51), respectively, from 2000 to 2020. Males aged 55 to 75 years were most frequently affected. Overall incidence risk from 2000-2020 by age was higher in Black males IRR > 1 (1.18, 95% CI, 1.16-1.21). The most common primary PC site for Black males and females was the head of the pancreas, 49.06% and 49.88%, respectively. By staging, distant PC had the highest frequency in Blacks. Poverty level was associated with PC incidence among females and PC mortality among both males and females. Stage was associated with survival among males with localized and regional PC. The 5-year relative survival was less than 11% across combined PC stages for both sexes. Black males had a relatively lower 5-year survival than Black females in localized (31.7 vs. 37.2%) and distant PC (2.6% vs. 2.90%). Mutant KRAS expression was higher in Black males. PC incidence and mortality were significantly higher in Black males. Our analysis points to the importance of poverty alleviation programs that target females are likely to reduce PC incidence. Furthermore, receiving recommended screening for PC and early-stage diagnostics is important to lower PC mortality.",

While FUT1 is known to enhance tumor stemness, adhesion, migration, and drug resistance in specific cancers, its role across diverse cancer types and its association with clinical prognosis and molecular features remain unclear. In this study, FUT1 expression was systematically analyzed across 33 cancer types using data from multiple public databases, including CCLE, TCGA, and GTEx. FUT1 expression was found to vary across cancers, correlating with poor prognosis in ACC, BLCA, and COAD and demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy in READ and COAD. Genomic analyses revealed frequent FUT1 amplifications and associations with genomic instability, while functional analyses linked FUT1 to proliferation, metastasis, and EMT pathways. FUT1 expression was also associated with immune microenvironment features, such as immune cell infiltration and stromal scores, and correlated with TMB and MSI. Drug sensitivity analysis indicated that FUT1 expression was linked to lower sensitivity to most drugs but increased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Experimental validation confirmed that FUT1 knockdown inhibited proliferation, invasion, and migration in bladder, breast, and colorectal cancer cell lines, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression, though further evidence is required to fully establish its oncogenic involvement. These findings highlight FUT1 as a potential prognostic biomarker and provide insights into its biological functions and relevance for developing targeted therapeutic strategies across cancers.",

The availability of large-scale public datasets, such as NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus, International Cancer Genome Consortium, and The Cancer Genome Atlas, has significantly boosted many scientific discoveries. However, to analyze and interpret these vast datasets, sophisticated bioinformatic tools are often necessary. Phantasus is a user-friendly web application designed to streamline gene expression analysis. By integrating data loading, normalization, filtering, enrichment pathways analysis, and principal component analysis, Phantasus enables researchers to promptly investigate and evaluate complex gene expression patterns. This tool simplifies the identification of differentially expressed genes and the discovery of novel biological insights. Here, we demonstrate how Phantasus can be utilized for gene expression analysis in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary malignant brain tumour in adults. Specifically, we focus on the role of purinergic signaling, with particular emphasis on the P2RX7 mRNA coding for the P2X7 receptor (P2RX7). To illustrate our proposal, we analyzed the expression of genes related to purinergic signaling in GBM patients stratified by high and low levels of P2RX7 expression. By harnessing Phantasus, researchers can further explore and navigate the nuances of gene regulation and its impact on human health and diseases.",

          "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common and aggressive type of pancreatic cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 8%. Its high mortality is largely due to late diagnosis, metastatic potential, and resistance to therapy. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a key role in metastasis, enabling cancer cells to become mobile. Partial EMT, where cells maintain both epithelial and mesenchymal traits, is more frequent in tumors than complete EMT and contributes to cancer progression. The long non-coding RNA MIR31 host gene (MIR31HG) has recently emerged as a critical factor in PDAC oncogenesis. This study aimed to investigate MIR31HG's role in partial EMT and its association with the basal-like PDAC subtype. We analyzed the relationship between MIR31HG expression, partial EMT, and the basal-like subtype of PDAC by integrating data from public databases. We reanalyzed public data from PDAC patient-derived organoids to assess MIR31HG expression and gene signatures under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses, including gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), were used to investigate differentially expressed genes and pathway enrichments. EMT, partial EMT, and hypoxia scores were calculated based on the expression levels of specific gene sets. We observed that MIR31HG overexpression strongly correlates with higher partial EMT scores and the stabilization of the epithelial phenotype in PDAC. MIR31HG is highly expressed in the basal-like subtype of PDAC, which exhibits partial EMT traits. Hypoxia, a hallmark of basal-like PDAC, was shown to significantly induce MIR31HG expression, thereby promoting the basal-like phenotype and partial EMT. In patient-derived organoids, hypoxic conditions increased MIR31HG expression and enhanced basal-like and partial EMT gene signatures, while normoxia reduced these expressions. These findings suggest that hypoxia-induced MIR31HG expression plays a crucial role in driving the aggressive basal-like subtype of PDAC. Our results indicate that MIR31HG is crucial in regulating PDAC progression, particularly in the aggressive basal-like subtype associated with hypoxia and partial EMT. Targeting the MIR31HG-mediated network may offer a novel therapeutic approach to combat hypoxia-driven PDAC.",

Therapeutics and outcomes remain hidden because we lack insights that could be gained from analyzing ancestrally diverse genomic data. To address this significant gap, we present PhyloFrame, a machine learning method for equitable genomic precision medicine. PhyloFrame corrects for ancestral bias by integrating functional interaction networks and population genomics data with transcriptomic training data. Application of PhyloFrame to breast, thyroid, and uterine cancers shows marked improvements in predictive power across all ancestries, less model overfitting, and a higher likelihood of identifying known cancer-related genes. Validation in fourteen ancestrally diverse datasets demonstrates that PhyloFrame is better able to adjust for ancestry bias across all populations. The ability to provide accurate predictions for underrepresented groups, in particular, is substantially increased. Analysis of performance in the most diverse continental ancestry group, African, illustrates how phylogenetic distance from training data negatively impacts model performance, as well as PhyloFrame's capacity to mitigate these effects. These results demonstrate how equitable artificial intelligence (AI) approaches can mitigate ancestral bias in training data and contribute to equitable representation in medical research.",

Alterations involving CDKN2A and components of PRC2 have been implicated as early drivers of peripheral nerve sheath tumor (PNST) evolution, but these events do not occur in all MPNST. Accordingly, emerging data have begun to highlight the importance of molecular-based stratification to improve outcomes in patients with NF1-PNST. In this study, we perform an integrated analysis of multiple, independent datasets obtained from human patients with NF1 to gain critical insights into PNST evolution and MPNST heterogeneity. We show that delta-like noncanonical Notch ligand 1 (DLK1) is significantly increased in MPNST and provide evidence that DLK1 overexpression may precede histologic changes consistent with malignancy. In complementary analyses, we find that serum levels of DLK1 are significantly higher in both mice and humans harboring MPNST compared with those without malignancy. Importantly, although DLK1 expression is increased in MPNST overall, through the integration of multiple, independent datasets, we demonstrate that divergent levels of DLK1 expression distinguish MPNST subsets characterized by unique molecular programs and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. Specifically, we show that overexpression of DLK1 is associated with the reactivation of embryonic signatures, an immunosuppressive microenvironment, and a worse overall survival in patients with NF1-MPNST. Collectively, our findings provide critical insights into MPNST tumorigenesis and support prospective studies evaluating the utility of DLK1 tissue and serum levels in augmenting diagnosis, risk assessment, and therapeutic stratification in the setting of NF1-PNST.",

Cohesin is a multi-subunit protein complex that is essential for sister chromatid cohesion, three-dimensional chromosome organization, DNA damage repair, and gene regulation. It forms a ring around DNA, with four structural subunits, SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, and either STAG1 or STAG2. In particular, the cohesin subunit STAG2 is one of only 12 human genes to be significantly mutated in four or more distinct types of cancer. Cohesin mutations are typically heterozygous and result in haploinsufficiency and/or loss-of-function, and although they might be expected to cause defects in chromosome segregation, the sister chromatid cohesion function of the complex is unlikely the driving mechanism of tumorigenesis, given the lack of aneuploidy in cohesin-mutant cancers. In this review, we will focus on the prevalence of somatic mutations in cohesin subunits across different cancer types, the influence of these mutations on chromatin organization and gene regulation, the resulting cellular and disease phenotypes, and the therapeutic potential of targeting the mutant cohesin complex.",

The family of transmembrane tyrosine kinases that promote neuronal growth includes the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptors (NTRKs). NTRK1-3 genes encode the members of this family. Alterations of NTRK genes can induce carcinogenesis both in neurogenic and non-neurogenic cells. The prevalence of NTRK gene fusion is under 1% in solid tumours but is highly encountered in rare tumours. Since the prognostic values of NTRK families' expression in various types of cancer are becoming increasingly evident, we aimed to conduct a comprehensive bioinformatics study evaluating the prognostic significance of the NTRK family in BC. Online bioinformatic databases including TCGA, UALCAN, Kaplan-Meier plotter, bc-GenExMiner, cBioPortal, STRING, Enrichr, and TIMER were utilized for analysis. High levels of NTRK2 and 3 demonstrated better associations with overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in BC patients (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u2009.05), while high levels of NTRK1 showed an applicable correlation with RFS in BC patients (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u2009.001).

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) remains the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, with no effective treatments. While cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6is) show clinical promise in some cancers, they have not significantly improved survival in GBM patients. This lack of response is attributed to the treatment-resistant glioma stem cell (GSC) population. We previously identified truncated glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (tGLI1) as a novel transcription factor promoting GSCs; however, its role in CDK4/6i resistance has never been investigated in any cancer type. Here, we found positive correlations between tGLI1 and CDK4/6 therapeutic resistance in patient datasets and <i>in vitro</i> studies. Pharmacological inhibition of tGLI1 using FDA-approved ketoconazole (KCZ), a tGLI1-specific inhibitor, sensitized GBM and GSCs to CDK4/6is. KCZ+CDK4/6i combination therapy demonstrated synergistic anti-proliferative effects, significantly inhibiting GBM stemness and cell cycle progression while increasing apoptosis. The combination was more efficacious than monotherapies in two orthotopic GBM mouse models. tGLI1 promoted GBM resistance to radiation therapy and temozolomide, while KCZ potentiated effects of these treatments. Collectively, we report for the first time that tGLI1 is a novel mediator of GBM resistance to CDK4/6is, and KCZ sensitizes GBM to CDK4/6is, thereby supporting future clinical utility of novel KCZ+CDK4/6i combinatorial therapy for GBM patients.",

          "abstract": "The cellular programs that mediate therapy resistance are often important drivers of metastasis, a phenomenon that needs to be understood better to improve screening and treatment options for cancer patients. Although this issue has been studied extensively for chemotherapy, less is known about a causal link between resistance to radiation therapy and metastasis. We investigated this problem in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and established that radiation resistant tumor cells have enhanced metastatic capacity, especially to bone. Resistance to radiation increases the expression of integrin \u03b23 (ITG\u03b23), which promotes enhanced migration and invasion. Bioinformatic analysis and subsequent experimentation revealed an enrichment of RNA metabolism pathways that stabilize ITG\u03b23 transcripts. Specifically, the RNA binding protein heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (HNRNPL), whose expression is regulated by Nrf2, mediates the formation of circular RNAs (circRNAs) that function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) for the family of let-7 microRNAs that target ITG\u03b23. Collectively, our findings identify a novel mechanism of radiation-induced metastasis that is driven by alterations in RNA metabolism.",

However, the tumour microenvironment is not static and is constantly remodelled by a variety of cellular components, including tumour cells, through mechanical, biological and chemical means to promote metastasis. Focal adhesion plays an important role in cell-extracellular matrix adhesion. An in-depth exploration of the role of focal adhesion in tumour metastasis, especially their contribution at the biomechanical level, is an important direction of current research. In this review, we first summarize the assembly of focal adhesions and explore their kinetics in tumour cells. Then, we describe in detail the role of focal adhesion in various stages of tumour metastasis, especially its key functions in cell migration, invasion, and matrix remodelling. Finally, we describe the anti-tumour strategies targeting focal adhesion and the current progress in the development of some inhibitors against focal adhesion proteins. In this paper, we summarize for the first time that focal adhesion play a positive feedback role in pro-tumour metastatic matrix remodelling by summarizing the five processes of focal adhesion assembly in a multidimensional way. It is beneficial for researchers to have a deeper understanding of the role of focal adhesion in the biological behaviour of tumour metastasis and the potential of focal adhesion as a therapeutic target, providing new ideas for the prevention and treatment of metastases.",

BKT300 is a small molecule shown to selectively inhibit leukemic cell migration and survival by targeting the PRC1 pathways. The current work aimed to examine the role of PRC1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and to assess the impact of BKT300, a small molecule PRC1 inhibitor, on AML cell viability and tumor growth in mouse xenograft AML models. BKT300 directly bound PRC1, resulting in disrupted actin and microtubule formation, G2/M cell cycle arrest, mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis via the caspase-3 pathway in AML cells. BKT300 inhibited PRC1 dephosphorylation at T481, downregulated CDC25C and upregulated p21, effectively halting the cell cycle and inhibiting leukemic cell proliferation while sparing normal cells. PRC1 was found to be overexpressed in AML patients and cell lines, with high levels associated with reduced overall patient survival. In addition, PRC1 expression levels correlated with BKT300 efficacy. BKT300 treatment led to 98% of tumor growth inhibition and 89.4% of tumor regression in mouse xenograft AML models, without notable impacts on normal hematopoiesis or biochemistry, even at high doses. As a first-in-class targeted therapy, BKT300 presents a promising new treatment option for advanced AML.",

          "abstract": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with significant clinical heterogeneity. Recent studies suggest that the intratumoral microbiome may influence the tumor microenvironment, affecting patient prognosis and therapeutic responses. This study aims to identify microbiome-related subtypes in DLBCL and assess their impact on prognosis, immune infiltration, and therapeutic sensitivity. Transcriptomic and microbiome data from 48 DLBCL patients were obtained from public databases. Consensus clustering was used to classify patients into distinct microbiome-related subtypes. Functional enrichment analysis, immune infiltration assessments, and single-cell RNA sequencing were performed to explore the biological characteristics of these subtypes. Drug sensitivity predictions were made using the OncoPredict tool. Hub genes' expression and biological function were validated and inferred in cell lines and independent cohorts of DLBCL. Two distinct microbiome-related subtypes were identified. Patients in Cluster 1 exhibited significantly better overall survival (P\u2009<\u20090.05), with higher immune infiltration of regulatory T cells and M0 macrophages compared to Cluster 2, which was associated with poorer outcomes. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that genes in Cluster 1 were involved in immune regulatory pathways, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions and chemokine signaling, suggesting enhanced anti-tumor immune responses. In contrast, genes in Cluster 2 were enriched in immunosuppressive pathways, contributing to a less favorable prognosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed significant heterogeneity in immune cell populations within the tumor microenvironment. B cells exhibited the most notable heterogeneity, as indicated by stemness and differentiation potential scoring. Intercellular communication analysis demonstrated that B cells played a key role in immune cell interactions, with significant differences observed in MIF signaling between B-cell subgroups. Pseudo-time analysis further revealed distinct differentiation trajectories of B cells, highlighting their potential heterogeneity across different immune environments. Metabolic pathway analysis showed significant differences in the average expression levels of metabolic pathways among B-cell subgroups, suggesting functional specialization. Furthermore, interaction analysis between core genes involved in B-cell differentiation and microbiome-driven differentially expressed genes identified nine common genes (GSTM5, LURAP1, LINC02802, MAB21L3, C2CD4D, MMEL1, TSPAN2, and CITED4), which were found to play critical roles in B-cell differentiation and were influenced by the intratumoral microbiome. DLBCL cell lines and clinical cohorts validated that MMEL1 and CITED4 with important biologically function in DLBCL cell survival and subtype classification. This study demonstrates the prognostic significance of the intratumoral microbiome in DLBCL, identifying distinct microbiome-related subtypes that impact immune infiltration, metabolic activity, and therapeutic responses. The findings provide insights into the immune heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment, focusing on B cells and their differentiation dynamics. These results lay the foundation for microbiome-based prognostic biomarkers and personalized treatment approaches, ultimately aiming to enhance patient outcomes in DLBCL.",

To identify targetable determinants of peritoneal metastasis, we focused on appendiceal adenocarcinoma (AC), a gastrointestinal cancer that metastasizes almost exclusively to the peritoneum. Current treatments are extrapolated from colorectal cancer (CRC), yet AC has distinct genomic alterations, mucinous morphology and peritoneum restricted metastatic pattern. Further, no stable preclinical models of AC exist, limiting drug discovery and representing an unmet clinical need. We establish a first-in-class stable biobank of 16 long-term cultured AC patient-derived organoids (PDOs), including 3 matched, simultaneously resected primary AC-peritoneal carcinomatosis (AC-PC) pairs. By enriching for cancer cells, AC PDOs enable accurate genomic characterization relative to paucicellular AC tissue. We establish an organoid orthotopic intraperitoneal xenograft model that recapitulates diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis and show that PC-organoids retain increased metastatic capacity, decreased growth factor dependency and sensitivity to standard of care chemotherapy relative to matched primary AC organoids. Single cell profiling of AC-PC pairs reveals dedifferentiation from mucinous differentiated states in primary AC into intestinal stem cell and fetal progenitor states in AC-PC, with upregulation of oncogenic signaling pathways. Through hypothesis-driven drug testing, we identify KRAS<sup>MULTI</sup>-ON inhibitor RMC-7977 and Wnt-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor WNTinib as novel, clinically actionable strategies to target AC-PC more effectively.",

S-palmitoylation is mediated by palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs), a family of 23 enzymes commonly referred to as zDHHCs, which catalyze the addition of palmitate to cysteine residues on specific target proteins. Aberrant S-palmitoylation events have been linked to the pathogenesis of multiple human diseases. While there have been advances in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of various skin conditions, there remain gaps in the knowledge, specifically with respect to the contribution of S-palmitoylation to the maintenance of skin barrier function. Towards this goal, we performed PubMed literature searches relevant to S-palmitoylation in skin to define current knowledge and areas that may benefit from further research studies. Furthermore, to identify alterations in gene products that are S-palmitoylated, we utilized bioinformatic tools such as SwissPalm and analyzed relevant data from publicly available databases such as cBioportal. Since the targeting of S-palmitoylated targets may offer an innovative treatment perspective, we surveyed small molecules inhibiting zDHHCs, including 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) which is associated with off-target effects, and other targeting strategies. Collectively, our work aims to advance both basic and clinical research on skin barrier function with a focus on zDHHCs and relevant protein targets that may contribute to the pathogenesis of skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and skin cancers including melanoma.",

We show that the lack of BLM causes a decrease in the autophosphorylation of ATM in mice mammary glands, which have lost one or both copies of BLM. In isogenic human cells, the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway was dampened in the absence of BLM, which negatively affected the recruitment of DDR factors onto the chromatin, thereby indicating a direct role of BLM in augmenting DDR. Mechanistically, this was due to the BLM-dependent dissociation of inactive ATM dimers into active monomers. Fragmentation analysis of BLM followed by kinase assays revealed a 20-mer BLM peptide (91-110 aa), sufficient to enhance ATM-dependent p53 phosphorylation. ATM-mediated phosphorylation of BLM at Thr99 within BLM (91-110) peptide enhanced ATM kinase activity due to its interaction with NBS1 and causing ATM monomerization. Delivery of phosphomimetic T99E counterpart of BLM (91-110 aa) peptide led to ATM activation followed by restoration of the DDR even in the absence of ionizing irradiation (both in cells and in BLM knockout mice), indicating its role as a DDR agonist, which can be potentially used to prevent the initiation of neoplastic transformation.",

          "abstract": "CALGB 40903 (Alliance) was a phase II single arm multicenter trial conducted in postmenopausal patients diagnosed with estrogen-receptor (ER) positive breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) without invasion. Patients were treated with the aromatase inhibitor (AI) letrozole for 6\u00a0months prior to surgery with change in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enhancement volume compared to baseline as the primary endpoint. In the current study, we performed sequence analysis of pre- and post-treatment specimens to determine gene expression and DNA copy number parameters associated with treatment and response. Paraffin sections from pretreatment biopsies and post-treatment surgical specimens were evaluated for presence of DCIS. Proliferation based on KI67 staining was quantified by a study pathologist. Macrodissection of the DCIS components from thin sections was the source of RNA and DNA. Whole-transcriptome RNA and shallow whole-genome DNA sequencing were performed. PAM50 analysis to assign intrinsic subtypes with associated probability of class membership was performed. Differential gene expression comparing responders versus non-responders and pre- versus post-treatment specimens was performed using a two-tiered approach based on candidate genes and a whole genome survey with appropriate multiple testing corrections. Based on availability of specimens and presence of DCIS component, 29 patients (from the 70 who completed the treatment trial) were included in the final data set, including five who had a pathologic complete response (pCR). Response to treatment was qualified categorically based on a threshold of 10% KI67 in the post-treatment surgical specimen or pCR. Based on this criterion, six of the 29 DCIS were considered non-responders (>\u200910% KI67) and five subjects with pCR were assigned to the responder group. No standard clinical variables were associated with response. On the basis of gene expression analysis, 19 of the pre-treatment samples were classified as luminal A, all of which were classified as responders. PAM50 classification of the other ten pre-treatment samples included luminal B, HER2, basal, and normal-like, six of which were non-responders. PAM50 class membership shifted from baseline to post-treatment in eight cases, most often from luminal A to normal-like (five cases). Selected genes associated with estrogen receptor levels in invasive breast cancer were higher in AI responsive tumors. AI treatment resulted in reductions in estrogen and proliferation related genes. Letrozole treatment produced an effective growth response, particularly in DCIS initially classified as luminal A. Study inclusion criteria of DCIS with at least 1% ER positive cells resulted in the inclusion of other subtypes that failed to respond. Treatment also induced both minor and major changes in intrinsic subtype based on PAM50 probabilities. Overall, these data indicate that response to AI treatment in ER(\u2009+) DCIS is variable and analogous to that observed in invasive breast cancers. Treatment for breast DCIS ranges from active surveillance to mastectomy, often combined with adjuvant endocrine therapy. The work presented here based on a unique neoadjuvant trial provides direct information on hormone therapy responsiveness of this disease and further couples the biology of invasive breast cancer to its non-obligate precursor.

          "abstract": "Previous genome-wide association studies have linked three missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in C1q/TNF-related protein 6 (CTRP6) to diseases such as type 1 diabetes and autoimmune diseases. However, the potential association of newly identified missense CTRP6 variants with diseases, especially cancer, remains unclear. We used several pathogenicity prediction algorithms to identify deleterious mutations within the highly conserved C1q domain of human CTRP6, following the retrieval of all SNPs from the Ensembl database. We systematically analyzed the effects of these mutations on the protein's stability, flexibility, structural conformation, compactness, stiffness, and overall functionality using various bioinformatics tools. Additionally, we investigated the association of these mutations with different cancer types using the cBioPortal and canSAR databases. We identified 11 detrimental missense SNPs within the C1q domain, a region critical for this protein's functionality. Using various computational methods, we predicted the functional impact of these missense variants and assessed their effects on the stability and flexibility of the CTRP6 structure. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed significant structural differences between the native and mutated structures, including changes in structural conformation, compactness, solvent accessibility, and flexibility. Additionally, our study shows a strong association between two mutations, G181S and R247W, and certain types of cancer: colon adenocarcinoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, respectively. We also found that the mutational status of CTRP6 and other cancer-related genes, such as MAP2K3, p16, TP53, and JAK1, affected each other's expression, potentially contributing to cancer development. Our screening and predictive analysis of pathogenic missense variants in CTRP6 advance the understanding of the functional implications of these mutations, potentially facilitating more focused and efficient research in the future.",

We found that PI3K-Akt signalling is dysregulated in LS-associated CRC, while Wnt signalling predominates in sporadic CRC. Moreover, our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of PI3K-Akt pathway inhibitors, such as taselisib, for LS-associated CRC patients with high pathway dependency. Similarly, Wnt signalling pathway inhibitors, such as XAV939, offer a promising therapeutic approach for sporadic CRC.

          "abstract": "ENOPH1 (Enolase-phosphatase 1), a member of the HAD-like hydrolase superfamily, has been linked to a range of physiological conditions, including neurological disorders. However, its involvement in tumorigenesis remains underexplored. This study is the first to conduct a pan-cancer analysis of ENOPH1, aiming to elucidate its role in multiple cancers through various bioinformatics platforms. We conducted a thorough analysis using data from UCSC databases. ENOPH1 expression in tumor and normal tissues was evaluated using R language software. Survival analyses, genetic alterations, and RNA modifications were assessed through the GEPIA2 and cBioPortal platforms. The relationships between ENOPH1 and immune infiltration, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) were examined using TIMER2 and R software. ENOPH1-related gene enrichment analysis was performed using the STRING and GEPIA2 databases, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. ENOPH1 expression was significantly upregulated in various cancers, including ACC, BLCA, BRCA, and COAD. High ENOPH1 expression was associated with poor overall survival (OS) in cancers such as KICH, LIHC, BRCA and LUAD. High ENOPH1 expression was associated with poor disease specific survival (DSS) in cancers such as KICH, LIHC, BRCA and MESO. Genetic alterations of ENOPH1, primarily mutations and deep deletions, were identified in UCEC, BLCA, and OV. ENOPH1 showed significant correlations with RNA modifications (m1A, m5C, m6A), immune checkpoints, and immune modulators across multiple cancer types. ENOPH1 was positively correlated with TMB, MSI, and HRD in cancers like BLCA, BRCA, and STAD. Furthermore, enrichment analysis revealed that ENOPH1 interacts with proteins involved in critical pathways such as AMPK, Hippo, and PI3K-AKT, suggesting its role in cancer progression. This pan-cancer analysis reveals ENOPH1's potential as a prognostic biomarker and its involvement in key signaling pathways across multiple cancers. Our findings provide new insights into the role of ENOPH1 in tumorigenesis and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.",

Studies in developmental models suggest that TNC may regulate the Wnt signaling pathway. Our laboratory has shown high levels of Wnt signaling and TNC expression in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), a highly lethal cancer with an abysmal approximately 3- to 5-month median survival. Here, we investigated the role of TNC in facilitating ligand-dependent Wnt signaling in thyroid cancer. We used bulk RNA-sequencing from 3 independent multi-institutional thyroid cancer patient cohorts. TNC expression was spatially localized in patient tumors with RNA in situ hybridization. The role of TNC was investigated in vitro using Wnt reporter assays and in vivo with a NOD.PrkdcscidIl2rg-/- mouse ATC xenograft tumor model. TNC expression was associated with aggressive thyroid cancer behavior, including anaplastic histology, extrathyroidal extension, and metastasis. Spatial localization of TNC in patient tissue demonstrated a dramatic increase in expression within cancer cells along the invasive edge, adjacent to Wnt ligand-producing fibroblasts. TNC expression was also increased in areas of intravascular invasion. In vitro, TNC bound Wnt ligands and potentiated Wnt signaling. Finally, in an ATC mouse model, TNC increased Wnt signaling, tumor burden, invasion, and metastasis. Altogether, TNC potentiated ligand-driven Wnt signaling and promotes cancer cell invasion and metastasis in a mouse model of thyroid cancer. Understanding the role of TNC and its interaction with Wnt ligands could lead to the development of novel biomarkers and targeted therapeutics for thyroid cancer.",

This study aimed to identify genomic factors associated with recurrence after resection of early-stage, node-negative CC. A retrospective cohort study was performed using clinicopathologic data, somatic mutations, and mRNA expression profiles from the cBioPortal database. The study enrolled patients with T1-3, N0, or M0 CC who underwent surgical resection and primary tumor sequencing. Those with fewer than 6 months of follow-up evaluation were excluded. Gene expression profiles were classified into consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs). Somatic mutations and CMS groups were analyzed for associations with recurrence. Of the 305 patients analyzed, 46 (15%) experienced recurrence. The median age at diagnosis was 70 years (interquartile range [IQR], 62-76 years), the gender distribution was balanced. The median follow-up period was 38 months, and the median time to recurrence was 13 months. The following 12 mutated genes were significantly associated with recurrence: KRAS (odds ratio [OR], 2.19), PIK3CA (OR, 2.13), DNAH11 (OR, 3.28), NALCN (OR, 4.69), COL6A3 (OR, 3.12), GRIN2A (OR, 4.92), COL6A1 (OR, 4.25), TNN (OR, 3.25), NEXMIF (OR, 6.97), PKHD1L1 (OR, 3.24), CDH4 (OR, 3.29), and BCL9 (OR, 4.03). Additionally, tumors classified as CMS4/mesenchymal subtype had a greater risk of recurrence (OR, 4.67) than the CMS2/canonical subtype. Patients with CMS4 or at least four mutations associated with recurrence (n = 77) had a 5-year disease-free survival rate of 57.7%. This study identified novel genomic signatures that may improve risk stratification in early-stage node-negative CC, potentially guiding the selection of high-risk patients for adjuvant therapy.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer, with its diverse subtypes like ER-positive, HER-2-positive, and triple-negative, presents complex challenges demanding personalized treatment approaches. The intricate interplay of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors underscores its status as a primary contributor to cancer-related fatalities in women globally. Understanding the molecular drivers specific to each subtype is crucial for developing effective therapies. In this landscape, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), also referred to as cellular communication network factor 2 (CCN2), emerges as a significant player. CTGF regulates critical biological activities like cell growth, invasion, and migration, impacting breast cancer development and progression. It modulates breast tumor microenvironment by promoting angiogenesis, activating cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and inducing inflammation. The activity of CTGF depends on several factors including oxygen levels, hormone signals, and growth factors and differs according to the type of breast cancer. CTGF can regulate breast cancer cells by activating various signaling pathways and modulating the transcription of other genes that are involved in tumor development and metastasis including S100A4, glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The matricellular protein can be considered a potential therapeutic target, as it can promote tumor growth and confer drug resistance in breast cancer. Numerous tactics, including neutralizing antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, natural compounds, recombinant proteins, and short hairpin RNAs have been suggested to block its function. This review highlights the structure of CTGF, regulation of its expression, and current knowledge of its oncogenic role in breast cancer, as well as focusing on potential therapeutic strategies for targeting CTGF in breast cancer.",

Recent sequencing analysis of lung adenocarcinoma has revealed the prevalence of alterations in the RIT1 gene that is a close RAS paralog. However, relative to RAS subfamily members KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS, our characterization of RIT1 oncogenic properties remains incomplete. Therefore, further investigation on RIT1 will facilitate future development of targeted therapies. Our bioinformatic analysis revealed that RIT1 alterations in lung cancer predicted poor survivals but differed from its RAS paralogs by showing largely amplification and mutation. Through biochemical characterization of RIT1 hotspot mutations, we propose that RIT1 alterations were associated with increased protein abundance that promoted cell growth. Transcriptomic profiling indicated that oncogenic RIT1 mutant expression influenced common tumorigenic RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and E2F1 pathways, in addition to altered NFE2L2 target expression. Importantly, RIT1 mutants markedly sensitized cells to ferroptosis induction, and RIT1 knockdown suppressed ferroptotic cell death. Lung adenocarcinoma NCI-H2110 cells containing endogenous RIT1 M90I mutation were susceptible to ferroptosis induction both in vitro and in vivo within xenograft models. Hence, our study unravels a novel aspect of RIT1 mutations in lung cancer and suggests ferroptosis induction as a potential therapeutic strategy to treat lung cancer patients carrying RIT1 mutations.",

PAQR11 influences lipid metabolism and susceptibility to ferroptosis in cancer cells. This study aims to investigate the prognostic significance of PAQR11, its relevance to immune responses, and its association with drug sensitivity across various cancer types. By elucidating these aspects, the research seeks to assess PAQR11's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology. We conducted a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis using publicly available pan-cancer datasets from TCGA, GEO, UALCAN, TIMER, GEPIA2, KM plotter, and TISIDB. This analysis encompassed gene expression profiles across 33 cancer types, with a focus on PAQR11's expression patterns, prognostic significance, and immunological relevance. In addition, the study explored the correlation between PAQR11 expression and drug sensitivity, alongside its molecular and pathological characteristics in various tumors. Our findings demonstrate elevated PAQR11 expression levels across multiple cancer types, which significantly correlate with patient prognostic outcomes. The analysis further revealed PAQR11's involvement in immunological and epigenetic processes, underscoring its critical role in cancer progression and treatment response. Notably, a strong correlation between PAQR11 expression and drug sensitivity was identified, suggesting its potential influence on the initiation and progression of various cancers and highlighting its promise as a therapeutic target. The comprehensive analysis of PAQR11 underscores its significance as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and its role in regulating immunological and epigenetic processes. These findings offer valuable insights that could inform early detection strategies and the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Further exploration and validation of PAQR11 are essential, highlighting the need for its integration into future oncological research and treatment strategy development. Not applicable.",

We performed targeted next-generation sequencing on 99 samples of operable OPSCC and a retrospective analysis of clinical data. We included 55 HPV/p16-positive and 44 HPV/p16-negative patients. We found a significant difference between both groups, particularly in TP53 mutation (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001). Among other things, a small primary tumor (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001), no ECS (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.026) were identified as predictors for survival. Multiple mutations were associated with an increased incidence of ECS, especially in HPV+/p16+ cases (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.017). A mutation in PIK3CA occurred more frequently in nonsmokers, especially in HPV-/p16- patients (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.027). A PTEN mutation-which only occurred in HPV+/p16+ tissues-reduced disease-free survival (DFS, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.026). The presence of multiple mutations in HPV+/p16+ OPSCC was associated with a higher risk of ECS. 3.",

          "abstract": "Paclitaxel is a standard of care neoadjuvant therapy for patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC); however, it shows limited benefit for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Here we used a coordinated experimental-computational approach to explore the influence of paclitaxel on the cellular and molecular responses of TNBC cells. We found that escalating doses of paclitaxel resulted in multinucleation, promotion of senescence, and initiation of DNA damage induced apoptosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of TNBC cells after paclitaxel treatment revealed upregulation of innate immune programs canonically associated with interferon response and downregulation of cell cycle progression programs. Systematic exploration of transcriptional responses to paclitaxel and cancer-associated microenvironmental factors revealed common gene programs induced by paclitaxel, IFNB, and IFNG. Transcription factor (TF) enrichment analysis identified 13 TFs that were both enriched based on activity of downstream targets and also significantly upregulated after paclitaxel treatment. Functional assessment with siRNA knockdown confirmed that the TFs FOSL1, NFE2L2 and ELF3 mediate cellular proliferation and also regulate nuclear structure. We further explored the influence of these TFs on paclitaxel-induced cell cycle behavior via live cell imaging, which revealed altered progression rates through G1, S/G2 and M phases. We found that ELF3 knockdown synergized with paclitaxel treatment to lock cells in a G1 state and prevent cell cycle progression. Analysis of publicly available breast cancer patient data showed that high ELF3 expression was associated with poor prognosis and enrichment in programs associated with cell cycle progression. Together these analyses disentangle the diverse aspects of paclitaxel response and identify ELF3 upregulation as a putative biomarker of paclitaxel resistance in TNBC.",

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a type of plasticity linked to resistance and metastasis. However, its exact impact on population diversity and its dynamics under chemotherapy is unknown. We used single-cell transcriptomics to investigate phenotypic diversity dynamics upon treatment in two in vitro models of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), where EMT-driven plasticity is either induced or spontaneously occurring. We report that EMT-driven plasticity confers higher phenotypic cell-cell variability (p\u2009<\u20090.001) while enriching for stem-like cells. Genetic and phenotypic cell-cell variability were not consistently correlated. High-plasticity populations displayed more pre-adapted cells before treatment (p\u2009=\u20090.03). In a population displaying spontaneous EMT and phenotypic variation, pre-adapted cells were a rare minority of high-scoring outliers whose expression patterns correlated with survival in TNBC patients subjected to chemotherapy (p\u2009=\u20090.03). Higher plasticity was not associated with a partial EMT status. Our results provide novel insights on how EMT-driven plasticity promotes a prospective diversification process increasing population phenotypic diversity, which can yield rare pre-adapted states before treatment. This highlights the need to tackle phenotypic diversity prior to treatment in high-plasticity tumours.",

This study aimed to comprehensively analyze KANK2 in 33 cancers using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database. Multiple web platforms and software were used for data analysis, including R, Cytoscape, HPA, TISIDB, UALCAN, GEO, cBioPortal, STRING, GSCALite, and CancerSEA. WB and qPCR experiments were used to verify the results. KANK2 is widely expressed in various tissues and has significant diagnostic value in multiple cancers, with AUC values exceeding 0.75 in 13 cancer types. Survival analysis indicated that KANK2 expression is significantly associated with overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in several cancers. KANK2 expression varied significantly across different molecular and immune subtypes and was associated with specific genetic mutations and DNA methylation patterns. Functional state analysis highlighted correlations with processes such as EMT, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. GSEA identified pathways related to proliferation, migration, and extracellular matrix remodeling. The key interacting proteins were identified by PPI network analysis, and the sensitive drug molecules were found by GSCA database. The results were also confirmed by two GEO datasets and WB and qPCR results.

In sharp contrast, the generally low CNV burden in leukemia leaves the CNV landscape and variations largely unexplored, impeding understanding of CNV in leukemia development. Through a comprehensive compilation of public datasets, we constructed LeukAtlas ( https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/leukemia ), a user-friendly database encompassing 12,597 CNVs from 1446 AML samples across diverse subtypes and age groups, providing tools for multidimensional CNV analysis. Our analyses suggested the CNV levels significantly varied among AML patients. We discovered two previously unknown CNV patterns in adult AML patients, dominated by segmental LOH and/or minor gain, which have been shown to be associated with chromosomal instability in solid tumors. Additionally, we defined two potential new AML subgroups based on CNVs status, providing new stratification markers within the existing karyotype framework. Representing the most extensive CNV collection in AML, LeukAtlas is a valuable resource for exploring the role of CNVs in the pathogenesis and prognosis stratification of leukemia. Interrogation of this database uncovers novel subclasses with unique CNV profiles and reveals heterogeneous CNV patterns in AML, demonstrating the potential role of chromosomal instability in AML progression.",

          "abstract": "Drug resistance constitutes one of the principal causes of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Although cancer cells can maintain viability independently of mitochondrial energy metabolism, they remain reliant on mitochondrial functions for the synthesis of new DNA strands. This dependency underscores a potential link between mitochondrial energy metabolism and drug resistance. Hence, drug resistance and mitochondrial energy metabolism-related differentially expressed genes (DMRDEGs) may emerge as candidates for novel cancer biomarkers. This study endeavors to assess the viability of DMRDEGs as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for breast cancer. We utilized the DRESIS database and MSigDB to identify genes related to drug resistance. Additionally, we sourced genes associated with mitochondrial energy metabolism from GeneCards and extant literature. By merging these genes with differentially expressed genes observed in normal and tumor tissues from the TCGA-BRCA and GEO databases, we successfully identified the DMRDEGs. Employing unsupervised consensus clustering, we divided breast cancer patients into two distinct groups based on the DMRDEGs. Consequently, we identified four hub genes to formulate a prognostic model, applying Cox regression, LASSO regression, and Random Forest methods. Furthermore, we examined immune infiltration and tumor mutation burden of the genes within our model and scrutinized divergences in the immune microenvironment between high- and low-risk groups. Small hairpin RNA and lentiviral plasmids were designed for stable transfection of breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and HCC1806. By conducting clone formation, scratch test, transwell assays, cell viability assay and measurement of oxygen consumption we initiated a preliminary investigation into mechanistic roles of AIFM1. We utilized DMRDEGs to develop a prognostic model that includes four mRNAs for breast cancer. This model combined with various clinical features and critical breast cancer facets, demonstrated remarkable efficacy in predicting patient outcomes. AIFM1 appeared to enhance the proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and HCC1806. Moreover, by reducing oxygen consumption, it aids in the cancer cells' acquisition of drug resistance. DMRDEGs hold promise as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for breast cancer. Among the associated mutated genes, ATP7B, FUS, AIFM1, and PPARG could serve as early diagnostic indicators, and notably, AIFM1 may present itself as a promising therapeutic target.",

          "abstract": "Up to 90% of patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) will develop resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy, posing substantial therapeutic challenges due to a lack of universally druggable targets. Leveraging BenevolentAI's artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approach to target discovery, we screened potential AI-predicted therapeutic targets mapped to unapproved tool compounds in patient-derived 3D models. This identified TNIK, which is modulated by NCB-0846, as a novel target for platinum-resistant HGSC. Targeting by this compound demonstrated efficacy across both in vitro and ex vivo organoid platinum-resistant models. Additionally, NCB-0846 treatment effectively decreased Wnt activity, a known driver of platinum resistance; however, we found that these effects were not solely mediated by TNIK inhibition. Comprehensive AI, in silico, and in vitro analyses revealed CDK9 as another key target driving NCB-0846's efficacy. Interestingly, TNIK and CDK9 co-expression positively correlated, and chromosomal gains in both served as prognostic markers for poor patient outcomes. Combined knockdown of TNIK and CDK9 markedly diminished downstream Wnt targets and reduced chemotherapy-resistant cell viability. Furthermore, we identified CDK9 as a novel mediator of canonical Wnt activity, providing mechanistic insights into the combinatorial effects of TNIK and CDK9 inhibition and offering a new understanding of NCB-0846 and CDK9 inhibitor function. Our findings identified the TNIK-CDK9 axis as druggable targets mediating platinum resistance and cell viability in HGSC. With AI at the forefront of drug discovery, this work highlights how to ensure that AI findings are biologically relevant by combining compound screens with physiologically relevant models, thus supporting the identification and validation of potential drug targets.",

          "abstract": "In situ immunization (ISI) has emerged as a promising approach to bolster early phases of the cancer immunity cycle through improved T-cell priming. One class of ISI agents, oncolytic viruses (OV), has demonstrated clinical activity, but overall benefit remains limited. Mounting evidence suggests that due to their inherent vulnerability to antiviral effects of type I IFN, OVs have limited activity in solid tumors expressing stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and/or retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). Here, using a combination of pharmacologic, genetic, and in vivo approaches, we demonstrate that VAX014, a bacterial minicell-based oncolytic ISI agent, activates both STING and RIG-I and leverages this activity to work best in STING-positive and/or RIG-I-positive tumors. Intratumoral treatment of established syngeneic tumors expressing STING and RIG-I with VAX014 resulted in 100% tumor clearance in two mouse models. Antitumor activity of VAX014 was shown to be dependent on both tumor-intrinsic STING and RIG-I with additive activity stemming from host-intrinsic STING. Analysis of human solid tumor datasets demonstrated STING and RIG-I co-expression is prevalent in solid tumors and associates with clinical benefit in many indications, particularly those most amenable to intratumoral administration. These collective findings differentiate VAX014 from OVs by elucidating the ability of this agent to elicit antitumor activity in STING-positive and/or RIG-I-positive solid tumors and provide evidence that STING/RIG-I agonism is part of VAX014's mechanism of action. Taken together, this work supports the ongoing clinical investigation of VAX014 treatment as an alternative to OV therapy in patients with solid tumors.",

Therefore, an artificial intelligence (AI) framework for learning histological patterns and predicting important genetic events would be useful for future studies and applications. Using the concept of multiple-instance learning, we developed an AI framework named GLioma Image-level and Slide-level gene Predictor (GLISP) to predict nine genetic abnormalities in hematoxylin and eosin sections: <i>IDH1/2</i>, <i>ATRX</i>, <i>TP53</i> mutations, <i>TERT</i> promoter mutations, <i>CDKN2A/B</i> homozygous deletion (CHD), <i>EGFR</i> amplification (<i>EGFR</i>amp), 7 gain/10 loss (7+/10-), 1p/19q co-deletion, and <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation. GLISP consists of a pair of patch-level GLISP-P and patient-level GLISP-W models, each pair of which is for a genetic prediction task, providing flexibility in clinical utility. In this study, the Cancer Genome Atlas whole-slide images (WSIs) were used to train the model. A total of 108 WSIs from the Tokyo Women's Medical University were used as the external dataset. In cross-validation, GLISP yielded patch-level/case-level predictions with top performances in <i>IDH1/2</i> and 1p/19q co-deletion with average areas under the curve (AUCs) of receiver operating characteristics of 0.75/0.79 and 0.73/0.80, respectively. In external validation, the patch-level/case-level AUCs of <i>IDH1/2</i> and 1p/19q co-deletion detection were 0.76/0.83 and 0.78/0.88, respectively. The accuracy in diagnosing IDH-mutant astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and IDH-wild-type glioblastoma was 0.66, surpassing the human pathologist average of 0.62 (0.54-0.67). In conclusion, GLISP is a two-stage AI framework for histology-based prediction of genetic events in adult gliomas, which is helpful in providing essential information for WHO 2021 molecular diagnoses.",

The <i>STK11</i> gene mutations are often associated with an immunologically \"cold\" tumour microenvironment. The co-occurrence of <i>STK11</i> or <i>KEAP1</i> abnormalities with the <i>KRAS</i> mutation changes the composition of the tumour microenvironment as compared when presented alone. The current data, based on retrospective analyses of clinical trials, indicate that the co-existence of <i>STK11</i> and <i>KEAP1</i> genes mutations with the <i>KRAS</i> gene mutations have negative impact on the prognosis, regardless of treatment methods, in patients with advanced NSCLC. However, this group of patients should not be omitted because they constitute a significant percentage of advanced NSCLC patients. Immunotherapy focused on two ICIs [anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1)/anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4)] combined with chemotherapy, may be more effective than immunotherapy or chemotherapy alone in this group of patients. Confirmation of this thesis can be found in the results of available clinical studies. Here, we summarize the theoretical justification as well as the results of clinical trials for combining immunotherapy in patients with <i>STK11</i>-, <i>KEAP1</i>- and <i>KRAS</i>-mutated genes. There is certainly a need to create a prospective clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of combined immunotherapy in the discussed group of patients.",

          "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) arise only during embryonic development, and their identity specification, emergence from the floor of the dorsal aorta, and proliferation are all tightly regulated by molecular mechanisms such as signaling cues. Among these, Wnt signaling plays an important role in HSPC specification, differentiation, and self-renewal, requiring precise modulation for proper development and homeostasis. Wnt signaling is initiated when a Wnt ligand binds to cell surface receptors such as those encoded by the <i>frizzled</i> gene family, activating intracellular signaling pathways that regulate gene expression. Secreted frizzled-related proteins (Sfrps) are known modulators of Wnt signaling, acting as both agonists and antagonists of this pathway. Yet, <i>in vivo</i> functions of Sfrps in HSPC development remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that Sfrp1a regulates zebrafish HSPC development and differentiation in a dose-dependent manner. In Sfrp1a loss of function animals, we observe an increase in HSPCs, an upregulation of canonical Wnt signaling, and a decrease in differentiation into both lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Conversely, at low-dose <i>sfrp1a</i> overexpression, there is a decrease in HSPCs and an increase in lymphoid differentiation. High-dose <i>sfrp1a</i> overexpression phenocopies the loss of function animals, with an increase in HSPCs, increased canonical Wnt signaling, and decreased lymphoid and myeloid differentiation. These findings highlight the importance of dose-dependent modulation of Sfrps, paralleling what is observed in hematopoietic cancers where SFRP1 loss-of-function and gain-of-function variants can drive tumorigenesis.",

Early diagnosis of OSCC is difficult and the prognosis has not improved significantly. This study aims to explore the role of tubulin polymerisation promoting protein 3 (TPPP3) in the occurrence and development of OSCC and discover new diagnostic and prognostic markers for OSCC. Using UALCAN, GEPIA, western blot, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we studied TPPP3 expression and its relationship with tumour stage. Then, we detected the effect of TPPP3 on OSCC biological functions by CCK-8 and cell scratch assays, as well as correlations between TPPP3 expression and survival of different kinds of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) patients through Kaplan-Meier plotter. Besides, we explored coexpressed genes associated with TPPP3 in HNSC using LinkedOmics and protein-protein interaction networks of TPPP3 using STRING and Cytoscape. Furthermore, we explored possible molecular mechanisms that TPPP3 functions in HNSC using UALCAN, Kaplan-Meier plotter, and TIMER. Finally, we analysed promoter methylation level by UALCAN and mutation by cBioPortal of TPPP3 in HNSC. TPPP3 was less expressed in OSCC. The TPPP3 expression level was negatively correlated with tumour stage. Furthermore, TPPP3 significantly inhibited OSCC proliferation and migration. Besides, TPPP3 high expression was significantly associated with good prognosis in different kinds of HNSC patients. Additionally, TPPP3 may regulate the occurrence and development of OSCC through the PALMD/PI3K pathway. TPPP3 methylation level in HNSC decreased. Finally, we found that TPPP3 genetic alteration was involved in TPPP3 mRNA expression change in HNSC. TPPP3 functions as a tumour suppressor in OSCC and is associated with good prognosis in HNSC patients. TPPP3 can be used as a potential biomarker for prognosis and diagnosis of OSCC. TPPP3 can be used as a potential biomarker for prognosis and diagnosis of OSCC in clinical practice.",

While cholesterol synthesis inhibitors such as statins have shown initial success, their efficacy is often compromised by the development of acquired resistance. Consequently, new strategies are being explored to disrupt cholesterol homeostasis more comprehensively by inhibiting its synthesis and intracellular transport. In this study, we investigate a previously underexplored function of PI5P4Ks, which catalyzes the conversion of PI(5)P to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at intracellular membranes. Our findings reveal that PI5P4Ks play a key role in facilitating lysosomal cholesterol transport, regulating lysosome positioning, and sustaining growth signaling via the mTOR pathway.

The role of micro ribonucleic acids (microRNAs) in p53-signaling cellular stress has been studied. MicroRNAs are the small non-coding RNAs, which regulate genes expression at post-transcriptional level. Many of them play a crucial role in carcinogenesis and may act as oncogenes or suppressor of tumor growth. The understanding of the effect of p53-responsive microRNA dysregulation on oncogenesis achieved in recent decades opens wide opportunities for the diagnosis, prediction and of microRNA-based cancer therapy. Development of new bioinformatics tools and databases for microRNA supports DLBCL research. We overview the studies on the role of miRNAs in regulating gene expression associated with tumorigenesis processes, with particular emphasis on their role as tumor growth-suppressing factors. The starting point is a brief description of the classical microRNA biogenesis pathway and the role of p53 in regulating the expression of these molecules. We analyze various molecular mechanisms leading to this dysregulation, including mutations in the <i>TP53</i> gene, DNA methylation, changes in host-genes expression or microRNA gene copy number, mutations in microRNA and microRNA biogenesis genes.",

In parallel siRNA screens of deubiquitinase enzymes, we identify OTUD6B as a positive regulator of KIFC1 expression that is required for centrosome clustering in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. OTUD6B can localise to centrosomes and the mitotic spindle and interacts with KIFC1. In OTUD6B-deficient cells, we see increased KIFC1 polyubiquitination and premature KIFC1 degradation during mitosis. Depletion of OTUD6B increases multipolar spindles without inducing centrosome amplification. Phenotypic rescue is dependent on OTUD6B catalytic activity and evident upon KIFC1 overexpression. OTUD6B is commonly overexpressed in breast cancer, correlating with KIFC1 protein expression and worse patient survival. TNBC cells with centrosome amplification, but not normal breast epithelial cells, depend on OTUD6B to proliferate. Indeed CRISPR-Cas9 editing results in only OTUD6B<sup>-/+</sup> TNBC cells which fail to divide and die. As a deubiquitinase that supports KIFC1 expression, allowing pseudo-bipolar cell division and survival of cancer cells with centrosome amplification, OTUD6B has potential as a novel target for cancer-specific therapies.",

PAX-interacting protein 1 (PAXIP1) serves a key role in the development of numerous human cancer types. Nevertheless, its specific involvement in HCC remains poorly understood. Public repository systems (Integrative Molecular Database of HCC, Gene Expression Omnibus, The Cancer Genome Atlas, University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Data Analysis Portal, Tumor Immune Estimation Resource and Human Protein Atlas) were utilized to explore PAXIP1 expression in HCC and evaluate the prognostic value of PAXIP1 in patients with HCC. PAXIP1 expression was investigated, and a notable relationship between PAXIP1 expression and various cancer types was found through analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data. More specifically, patients with HCC and lower PAXIP1 levels had improved survival rates. Furthermore, using LinkedOmics, the co-expression network of PAXIP1 in HCC was determined. Colocalization analysis of PAXIP1 using chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing data suggested that PAXIP1 might act as a cofactor for MYB proto-oncogene like 2 or FOXO1 in HCC. In addition, by predicting and analyzing the potential transcription factors related to PAXIP1, nuclear respiratory factor 1 was identified as a factor upstream of PAXIP1 in HCC. Notably, PAXIP1 expression exhibited a positive association with the infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, macrophages, neutrophils and myeloid dendritic cells. Furthermore, PAXIP1 expression was associated with a range of immune markers such as programmed cell death protein 1, programmed death-ligand 1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 in HCC. The findings of the present study highlighted the prognostic relevance of PAXIP1 and its function in modulating immune cell recruitment in HCC.",

Owing to limited clinical, familial and epidemiological data, thousands of variants are considered to be variants of uncertain significance<sup>2-4</sup> (VUS). Here we have utilized CRISPR-Cas9-based saturation genome editing in a humanized mouse embryonic stem cell line to determine the functional effect of VUS. We have categorized nearly all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the region that encodes the carboxylate-terminal DNA-binding domain of BRCA2. We have generated function scores for 6,551 SNVs, covering 96.4% of possible SNVs in exons 15-26 spanning BRCA2 residues 2479-3216. These variants include 1,282 SNVs that are categorized as missense VUS in the clinical variant database ClinVar, with 77.2% of these classified as benign and 20.4% classified as pathogenic using our functional score. Our assay provides evidence that 3,384 of the SNVs in the region are benign and 776 are pathogenic. Our classification aligns closely with pathogenicity data from ClinVar, orthogonal functional assays and computational meta predictors. We have integrated our embryonic stem cell-based BRCA2-saturation genome editing dataset with other available evidence and utilized the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines for clinical classification of all possible SNVs. This classification is available as a sequence-function map and serves as a valuable resource for interpreting unidentified variants in the population and for physicians and genetic counsellors to assess BRCA2 VUS in patients.",

The RNA sequencing reads and DNA coverage were correlated to improve the detection of the actionable <i>MET</i> exon 14 skipping variant (METex14). The pathogenicity of <i>MET</i> variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) was assessed using bioinformatic methods, based on their predicted driver potential. The effects of the predicted drivers VUS T992I and H1094Y on c-MET signaling activation, proliferation, and migration were evaluated in HEK293T, BEAS-2B, and H1993 cell lines. Subsequently, c-Met inhibitors were tested in 2D and 3D cell cultures, and drug affinity was determined using 3D structure simulations. The prevalence of <i>MET</i> variants in the South American cohort was 8%, and RNA-based diagnosis detected 27% more cases of <i>METex14</i> than DNA-based methods. Notably, 20% of <i>METex14</i> cases with RNA reads below the detection threshold were confirmed using DNA analysis. The novel actionable T992I and H1094Y variants induced proliferation and migration through c-Met/Akt signaling. Both variants showed sensitivity to crizotinib and savolitinib, but the H1094Y variant exhibited reduced sensitivity to capmatinib.

Overall, this study addresses a significant research in understanding small cell neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma in vivo and provides valuable insights for guiding radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.",

Most patients with PDAC present with advanced disease and are treated with cytotoxic therapy. Genomic biomarkers prognostic of disease outcomes have been challenging to identify. Herein leveraging a cohort of 2,336 patients spanning all disease stages, we characterize the genomic and clinical correlates of outcomes in PDAC. We show that a genomic subtype of KRAS wild-type tumors is associated with early disease onset, distinct somatic and germline features, and significantly better overall survival. Allelic imbalances at the KRAS locus are widespread. KRAS mutant allele dosage gains, observed in one in five (20%) KRAS-mutated diploid tumors, are correlated with advanced disease and demonstrate prognostic potential across disease stages. With the rapidly expanding landscape of KRAS targeting, our findings have potential implications for clinical practice and for understanding de novo and acquired resistance to RAS therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Nuclear speckles are dynamic nuclear bodies characterized by high concentrations of factors involved in RNA production. Although the contents of speckles suggest multifaceted roles in gene regulation, their biological functions are unclear. Here we investigate speckle variation in human cancer, finding two main signatures. One speckle signature was similar to healthy adjacent tissues, whereas the other was dissimilar, and considered an aberrant cancer speckle state. Aberrant speckles show altered positioning within the nucleus, higher levels of the TREX RNA export complex and correlate with poorer patient outcomes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), a cancer typified by hyperactivation of the HIF-2\u03b1 transcription factor. We demonstrate that HIF-2\u03b1 promotes physical association of certain target genes with speckles depending on HIF-2\u03b1 protein speckle-targeting motifs, defined in this study. We identify homologous speckle-targeting motifs within many transcription factors, suggesting that DNA-speckle targeting may be a general gene regulatory mechanism. Integrating functional, genomic and imaging studies, we show that HIF-2\u03b1 gene regulatory programs are impacted by speckle state and by abrogation of HIF-2\u03b1-driven speckle targeting. These findings suggest that, in ccRCC, a key biological function of nuclear speckles is to modulate expression of select HIF-2\u03b1-regulated target genes that, in turn, influence patient outcomes. Beyond ccRCC, tumour speckle states broadly correlate with altered functional pathways and expression of speckle-associated gene neighbourhoods, exposing a general link between nuclear speckles and gene expression dysregulation in human cancer.",

Here, we show that IFN\u03b3 receptor-deficient B16-F10 mouse melanoma tumours are controlled as efficiently as WT tumours despite their lower MHC class I expression. Mechanistically, IFN\u03b3 receptor deletion in B16-F10 tumours increases IFN\u03b3 availability, triggering a remodelling of the immune landscape characterised by inflammatory monocyte infiltration and the generation of 'mono-macs'. This altered myeloid compartment synergises with an increase in antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to promote anti-tumour immunity against IFN\u03b3 receptor-deficient tumours, with such an immune crosstalk observed around blood vessels. Importantly, analysis of transcriptomic datasets suggests that similar immune remodelling occurs in human tumours carrying mutations in the IFN\u03b3 pathway. Our work thus serves mechanistic insight for the crosstalk between tumour IFN\u03b3 resistance and anti-tumour immunity, and implicates this regulation for future cancer therapy.",

Although several genetic alterations such as ERG-TMPRSS2 fusion, MYC amplification, PTEN deletion and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 genes play a key role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, specific gene alteration signature that could distinguish indolent from aggressive prostate cancer or may aid in patient stratification for prognosis and/or clinical management of patients with prostate cancer is still missing. Therefore, here, by a multi-omics approach we describe a prostate cancer carrying the fusion of TMPRSS2 with ERG gene and deletion of 16q chromosome arm. We have observed deletion of KDM6A gene, which may represent an additional genomic alteration to be considered for patient stratification. The cancer hallmarks gene signatures highlight intriguing molecular aspects that characterize the biology of this tumor by both a high hypoxia and immune infiltration scores. Moreover, our analysis showed a slight increase in the Tumoral Mutational Burden, as well as an over-expression of the immune checkpoints. The omics profiling integrating hypoxia, ROS and the anti-cancer immune response, optimizes therapeutic strategies and advances personalized care for prostate cancer patients. The here data reported can lay the foundation for predicting a poor prognosis for the studied prostate cancer, as well as the possibility of targeted therapies based on the modulation of hypoxia, ROS, and the anti-cancer immune response.",

We developed the <i>pyBioPortal</i> Python package, which leverages the cBioPortal REST API to access genomic and clinical data. The retrieved data is returned as a Pandas DataFrame, a format widely used for data analysis in Python. <i>pyBioPortal</i> offers an efficient interface between the user and the cBioPortal database. The data is provided in formats conducive to further analysis and visualization, promoting workflows and improving reproducibility. The development of <i>pyBioPortal</i> addresses the challenge of accessing and processing large volumes of biomedical data. By simplifying the interaction with the cBioPortal API and providing data in Pandas DataFrame format, <i>pyBioPortal</i> allows users to focus more on the analytical aspects rather than data extraction. This tool facilitates the retrieval of heterogeneous biological and clinical data in a standardized format, making it more accessible for analysis and enhancing the reproducibility of results in cancer informatics.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms driven by CYBC1 could provide new therapeutic targets and prognostic markers for GBM. Publicly available datasets were analyzed to assess CYBC1 expression in GBM and its correlation with patient survival. GBM cell lines were genetically manipulated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to deplete CYBC1. The effects of CYBC1 deficiency on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle dynamics were experimentally evaluated. Additionally, the impact of CYBC1 on the expression of NOXA1, a subunit of NADPH oxidase, and downstream signaling pathways such as nuclear factor \u043aB (NF-\u03baB) was explored. CYBC1 expression was significantly elevated in GBM tissues and correlated with poor patient survival. CYBC1 deficiency in GBM cells resulted in reduced cell viability, migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, CYBC1 positively regulated NOXA1 expression, which in turn enhanced ROS production and activated the ERK\u00b7AKT/NF-\u03baB pathways. The suppression of CYBC1 led to decreased ROS levels, reduced phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB, and downregulation of genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. CYBC1 is implicated in GBM progression by regulating NOXA1-mediated ROS production and activating the ERK\u00b7AKT/NF-\u03baB pathways. This study suggests that CYBC1 could serve as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker in GBM, warranting further investigation into its molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential.",

In the early 2000's, genetic alterations of MACF1 were identified in several cancers suggesting that this cytoskeletal crosslinker was involved in tumor development and progression, while preclinical studies provided evidence that MACF1 is a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in glioblastomas, a central nervous system cancer derived from astrocytes and neural progenitor stem cells. Furthermore, investigations in glioblastomas demonstrated that genetic inhibitory targeting of this spectraplakin protein alone and in combination with DNA damaging agents had synergistic antitumorigenic effects. The established role of MACF1 in Wnt signaling, a known mechanistic driver of central nervous system development and pro-tumorigenic cell behavior in glioblastomas, provide a premise for addressing the potential of this spectraplakin protein as a novel oncoprotein in cancers with origins in the nervous system. The present review provides a summary of the role and function of MACF1 in the central nervous system, Wnt signaling and cancer development, specifically as an oncoprotein that underlie the transformation and oncogenic properties of glioblastomas.",

The expression levels, prognostic values, genetic mutations, and DNA promoter methylation of ZBTB11 across tumor types were explored via various online websites and databases, including TIMER2.0, GEPIA2, cBioPortal, UALCAN, GSCA, CancerSEA, and others. Additionally, a competing lncRNA-miRNA network of ZBTB11 was constructed, and its interaction with chemicals and genes was investigated. Our findings revealed that ZBTB11 was aberrantly expressed in a multitude of tumor types and exhibited variability across various tumor stages. A survival analysis revealed that ZBTB11 predicted a poor prognosis in BRCA, KIRP, LIHC, PCPG, PRAD, SARC, UCEC, and a good prognosis in CHOL, ESCA, GBM, KIRC, and READ. We also found that the most frequent genetic alterations type of ZBTB11 was mutation, and the DNA methylation level of ZBTB11 decreased in various cancers. Furthermore, ZBTB11 expression correlated with immune cells infiltration and genetic markers of immunodulators in cancers. Moreover, the results of single-cell sequencing demonstrated that ZBTB11 could regulate several tumor biological behaviors, including apoptosis, DNA damage, and angiogenesis. A lncRNA-miRNA network regulating ZBTB11 expression in tumor development and progression was constructed. It is of particular significance that ZBTB11 demonstrated a correlation with the CTRP and GDSC drug sensitivity, and that it served as a mediator between chemicals and cancers. These findings demonstrate that ZBTB11 is associated with multiple tumor types and disease prognosis. ZBTB11 may represent a potential key biomarker and therapeutic target in cancers.",

At the nucleotide level, such mutations are cancer-driving nucleotides (CDNs). The full sets of CDNs are necessary, and perhaps even sufficient, for the understanding and treatment of each cancer patient. Currently, only a small fraction of CDNs is known as most mutations accrued in tumors are not drivers. We now develop the theory of CDNs on the basis that cancer evolution is massively repeated in millions of individuals. Hence, any advantageous mutation should recur frequently and, conversely, any mutation that does not is either a passenger or deleterious mutation. In the TCGA cancer database (sample size <b>n</b>=300-1000), point mutations may recur in <i>i</i> out of <b>n</b> patients. This study explores a wide range of mutation characteristics to determine the limit of recurrences (<i>i<sup>*</sup></i>) driven solely by neutral evolution. Since no neutral mutation can reach <i>i<sup>*</sup></i>=3, all mutations recurring at <i>i</i>\u22653 are CDNs. The theory shows the feasibility of identifying almost all CDNs if <b>n</b> increases to 100,000 for each cancer type. At present, only <10% of CDNs have been identified. When the full sets of CDNs are identified, the evolutionary mechanism of tumorigenesis in each case can be known and, importantly, gene targeted therapy will be far more effective in treatment and robust against drug resistance.",

          "abstract": "A central goal of cancer genomics is to identify, in each patient, all the cancer-driving mutations. Among them, point mutations are referred to as cancer-driving nucleotides (CDNs), which recur in cancers. The companion study shows that the probability of <i>i</i> recurrent hits in <b>n</b> patients would decrease exponentially with <i>i</i>; hence, any mutation with <i>i</i> \u2265 3 hits in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database is a high-probability CDN. This study characterizes the 50-150 CDNs identifiable for each cancer type of TCGA (while anticipating 10 times more undiscovered ones) as follows: (i) CDNs tend to code for amino acids of divergent chemical properties. (ii) At the genic level, far more CDNs (more than fivefold) fall on noncanonical than canonical cancer-driving genes (CDGs). Most undiscovered CDNs are expected to be on unknown CDGs. (iii) CDNs tend to be more widely shared among cancer types than canonical CDGs, mainly because of the higher resolution at the nucleotide than the whole-gene level. (iv) Most important, among the 50-100 coding region mutations carried by a cancer patient, 5-8 CDNs are expected but only 0-2 CDNs have been identified at present. This low level of identification has hampered functional test and gene-targeted therapy. We show that, by expanding the sample size to 10<sup>5</sup>, most CDNs can be identified. Full CDN identification will then facilitate the design of patient-specific targeting against multiple CDN-harboring genes.",

This study aimed to retrospectively identify overlooked MLA in a large endometrial carcinoma cohort, using a combination of immunohistochemistry (IHC), morphology and KRAS sequencing. IHC was conducted on 1094 endometrial carcinomas, identifying 16 potential MLA cases based on GATA3+ and/or TTF1+ and ER- staining patterns, which subsequently underwent detailed histological review, KRAS sequencing and ProMisE molecular classification. Of the IHC screen-positive cases, one was positive for both GATA3 and TTF1, nine were positive for GATA3 only and six were positive for TTF1 only. All IHC screen-positive cases were POLE wild-type. All five tumours in the NSMP category showed morphological features of MLA, while the three MMRd and eight p53abn tumours did not show MLA morphology. The five cases diagnosed as MLA on review were all originally diagnosed as low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma probably because of rare morphological patterns, being predominantly papillary or ductal. Four of the five cases harboured a KRAS mutation. This study highlights the importance of a comprehensive diagnostic approach for accurately identifying endometrial MLA and for pathologists to be aware of papillary and ductal patterns in endometrial carcinoma assessment. Further exploration into the molecular landscape of MLA is essential for refining diagnostic criteria and developing targeted therapies.",

          "abstract": "Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) are commonly detected pancreatic cysts that may transform into pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Predicting which IPMNs will progress to PDAC remains a clinical challenge. Moreover, identifying those clinically evident IPMNs for which a surveillance approach is best is a dire clinical need. Therefore, we aimed to identify molecular signatures that distinguished between PDAC with and without clinical evidence of an IPMN to identify novel molecular pathways related to IPMN-derived PDAC that could help guide biomarker development. Data from the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) multi-institute sequencing project were utilized to analyze 66 PDAC cases from Moffitt Cancer Center and The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, for which tumor whole transcriptome sequencing datasets were generated. Cases were classified based on whether a tumor had originated from an IPMN (<i>n</i> = 16) or presumably through the pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) pathway (<i>n</i> = 50). We then performed differential expression and pathway analysis using Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Pathway Analysis with Down-weighted Genes (PADOG) algorithms. We also analyzed immune profiles using the Tumor-Immune Microenvironment Deconvolution web portal for Bulk Transcriptomics (TIMEx). Both GSEA and TIMEx indicate that PanIN-derived PDAC tumors enrich inflammatory pathways (complement, hedgehog signaling, coagulation, inflammatory response, apical surface, IL-2/STAT5, IL-6/STAT3, EMT, KRAS signaling, apical junction, IFN-gamma, allograft rejection) and are comparatively richer in almost all immune cell types than those from IPMN-derived PDAC. IPMN-derived tumors were enriched for metabolic and energy-generating pathways (oxidative phosphorylation, unfolded protein response, pancreas beta cells, adipogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, protein secretion), and the most significantly upregulated genes (padj < 0.001) included mucin 2 (MUC2) and gastrokine-2 (GKN2). Further, the metabolic-linked gene signature enriched in the IPMN-derived samples is associated with a cluster of early-stage and long-survival (top 4th quartile) PDAC cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) expression database. Our data suggest that IPMN-derived and PanIN-derived PDACs differ in the expression of immune profiles and metabolic pathways. These initial findings warrant validation and follow-up to develop biomarker-based strategies for early PDAC detection and treatment.",

          "abstract": "Cancer is a complex disease driven by genomic alterations, and tumor sequencing is becoming a mainstay of clinical care for cancer patients. The emergence of multi-institution sequencing data presents a powerful resource for learning real-world evidence to enhance precision oncology. GENIE BPC, led by American Association for Cancer Research, establishes a unique database linking genomic data with clinical information for patients treated at multiple cancer centers. However, leveraging sequencing data from multiple institutions presents significant challenges. Variability in gene panels can lead to loss of information when analyses focus on genes common across panels. Additionally, differences in sequencing techniques and patient heterogeneity across institutions add complexity. High data dimensionality, sparse gene mutation patterns, and weak signals at the individual gene level further complicate matters. Motivated by these real-world challenges, we introduce the Bridge model. It uses a quantile-matched latent variable approach to derive integrated features to preserve information beyond common genes and maximize the utilization of all available data, while leveraging information sharing to enhance both learning efficiency and the model's capacity to generalize. By extracting harmonized and noise-reduced lower-dimensional latent variables, the true mutation pattern unique to each individual is captured. We assess model's performance and parameter estimation through extensive simulation studies. The extracted latent features from the Bridge model consistently excel in predicting patient survival across six cancer types in GENIE BPC data.",

We present multiple lines of evidence converging on a critical mechanistic connection between PHF6 and PHIP. We show that PHIP loss phenocopies PHF6 loss, and that PHF6 requires PHIP to occupy chromatin and exert its downstream transcriptional program.

We previously found the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase, NPEPPS, as a druggable driver of cisplatin resistance in vitro and in vivo and in patient-derived organoids. Here, we present a general mechanism where NPEPPS interacts with the volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) to control cisplatin import into cells and thus regulate cisplatin response across a range of cancer types. We also find the NPEPPS/VRAC gene expression ratio is a predictive measure of cisplatin response in multiple cancer cohorts, showing the broad applicability of this mechanism. Our work describes a specific mechanism of cisplatin resistance, which, given the characteristics of NPEPPS as a drug target, has the potential to improve cancer patient outcomes. In addition, we describe an intracellular mechanism regulating VRAC activity, which is critical for volume regulation in normal cells - a finding with functional implications beyond cancer.",

Our findings associate Programmed Death- Ligand1 (PD-L1) with the RPA1-ETAA1 axis, suggesting that upregulated RPA1 -dependent ETAA1 may facilitate PD-L1 nuclear accumulation. We observed strong correlations between ETAA1 and RPA1 with the components involved in HDAC2-mediated deacetylation, clathrin -dependent endocytosis, and PD-L1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, aligning with the established regulatory pathway of PD-L1 nuclear translocation. Moreover, nuclear PD-L1 transactivates a panel of pro-inflammatory and immune response transcription factors, potentially reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment. We identified a landscape of infiltrating lymphocytes influenced by ETAA1, finding that levels of ETAA1 were negatively correlated with CD8<sup>+</sup> T and Natural Killer T (NKT) cells, but positively correlated with CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper 2 (Th2) cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), neutrophils and regulatory T cells (Tregs), suggesting a potential role in immune evasion. Further analysis shows that the RPA1-ETAA1 axis is significantly associated with multiple metastasis mediators and unfavorable liver cancer progression, with higher expression observed in advanced stages and poorly differentiated subgroups. These findings expand the role of the RPA1-ETAA1 axis beyond DNA repair, highlighting its potential as a target for cancer therapy.",

STAG2 is the most frequently mutated cohesin subunit across several cancer types and is a key tumor suppressor in lung cancer. Here, we coupled somatic CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and tumor barcoding with an autochthonous oncogenic KRAS-driven lung cancer model and showed that STAG2 is uniquely tumor-suppressive among all core and auxiliary cohesin components. The heterodimeric complex components PAXIP1 and PAGR1 have highly correlated effects with STAG2 in human lung cancer cell lines, are tumor suppressors in vivo, and are epistatic to STAG2 in oncogenic KRAS-driven lung tumorigenesis in vivo. STAG2 inactivation elicits changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and 3D genome conformation that impact the cancer cell state. Gene expression and chromatin accessibility similarities between STAG2- and PAXIP1-deficient neoplastic cells further relate STAG2-cohesin to PAXIP1/PAGR1. These findings reveal a STAG2-PAXIP1/PAGR1 tumor-suppressive axis and uncover novel PAXIP1-dependent and PAXIP1-independent STAG2-cohesin-mediated mechanisms of lung tumor suppression.",

          "abstract": "Since its introduction in the 1970s, endocrine therapy that targets the estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) signaling pathway has had tremendous success in the clinic in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. However, resistance to endocrine therapy eventually develops in virtually all patients with metastatic disease. Endocrine resistance is a primary unaddressed medical need for ER+ metastatic breast cancer patients. It has been shown that tumors become resistant through various mechanisms, converging on the acquisition of genetic alterations of ER, components of the MAP kinase pathway, or transcription factors (TFs). For instance, mutations in the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) lead to complete resistance to all current endocrine therapies including aromatase inhibitors, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and selective estrogen receptor degraders, as well as cross-resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6is). Emerging evidence points to an intriguing connection between endocrine-resistant tumors and the HER2-low subtype. Specifically, recent studies and our analysis of a publicly available breast cancer dataset both indicate that metastatic ER+ breast cancer with endocrine resistance conferred through acquired genetic alterations can often be classified as HER2-low rather than HER2-0/HER2-negative. Limited data suggest that acquired endocrine resistance can also be accompanied by a subtype switch. Therefore, we suggest that there is an underappreciated association between the HER2-low subtype and endocrine resistance. In this perspective piece, we explore the evidence linking the HER2-low subtype with the various pathways to endocrine resistance and suggest that there are signaling networks in HER2-low tumors that intersect endocrine resistance and can be effectively targeted.",

Among metastatic cases receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors, compared with LUAD<sup>non-muc</sup> (n\u00a0= 1511), LUAD<sup>Muc</sup> (n\u00a0= 112) had a lower objective response rate (ORR 8.4% versus 25.9%, P < 0.0001), and shorter median progression-free survival (mPFS 2.6 versus 3.9 months, P < 0.0001) and overall survival (mOS 9.9 versus 17.2 months, P < 0.0001). Similarly, patients with LUAD<sup>Muc</sup> had worse outcomes to chemoimmunotherapy. LUAD<sup>Muc</sup> (n\u00a0= 18) and LUAD<sup>non-muc</sup> (n\u00a0= 150) had similar ORR (16.7% versus 34.9%, P\u00a0= 0.12) and mPFS (4.6 versus 5.6 months, P\u00a0= 0.17) to treatment with KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitors, but LUAD<sup>Muc</sup> had shorter mOS (6.8 versus 10.8 months, P\u00a0= 0.018).

These mutations are characterized by low/absent BRAF kinase domain activation and are believed to amplify already active RAS signaling, potentially triggered by receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR. Two patients with <i>BRAF</i> class 3-mutated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were treated with erlotinib at our Institution after failure of standard therapies. Two cell lines were established from patients with <i>BRAF</i> class 3-mutated NSCLC, and their sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) was assessed using <i>EGFR-</i>mutated, <i>BRAF</i> class 1 and 2-mutated, and <i>KRAS</i>-mutated NSCLC cell lines as controls. Patient 1, a 60-year-old male with BRAF<sup>D594N</sup>-mutated NSCLC, achieved complete response to erlotinib after progression on first- and second-line chemotherapy. Patient 2, a 60-year-old female with BRAF<sup>D594G</sup>-mutated NSCLC, achieved partial response to erlotinib after progression on first-line chemoimmunotherapy. High baseline phosphorylated EGFR values and reduced EGFR activation following erlotinib were observed in <i>BRAF</i> class 3-mutated and <i>EGFR</i>-mutated cell lines, but not in <i>BRAF</i> class 1-mutated, <i>BRAF</i> class 2-mutated, or <i>KRAS</i>-mutated lines.

These findings were corroborated by 3-dimensional and sphere formation assays. In the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, <i>BRAF</i> class 3-mutated NSCLC cell lines showed greater sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs compared with <i>BRAF</i> class 2-mutated and <i>KRAS</i>-mutated lines. <i>BRAF</i> class 3 mutations in NSCLC may identify a novel targetable population sensitive to EGFR-TKIs.",

However, the cell type-specific epigenetic landscape of RCC-broadly and in the context of these mutations-is incompletely understood. To investigate these open questions, we integrated single nucleus ATAC sequencing data from RCC tumors across four independent cohorts. In clear cell RCC tumors, we identified four shared malignant epigenetic programs related to angiogenesis, proximal tubule-like features, interferon (IFN) signaling, and one that lacked distinct genomic regions with increased accessibility. Among the mutated epigenetic regulators, <i>BAP1</i> mutation exhibited the most significant impact on chromatin accessibility in tumor cells, and the associated epigenetic changes were linked to IFN response. We identify multiple potential sources of elevated IFN signaling in these lesions, such as increased immune infiltration and increased accessibility and expression of an IFN-associated ERV, ERV3-16A3_LTR. We find that the expression of ERV3-16A3_LTR may itself be a negative prognostic biomarker in ccRCC. Our findings highlight the convergence of malignant epigenetic programs across ccRCC tumors and suggest that <i>BAP1</i> loss, potentially through ERV3-16A3_LTR dysregulation, is associated with an IFN response-high epigenetic program.",

KIF18A plays a vital role in controlling microtubule length, which is crucial for maintaining proper cell function and division. Notably, increased expression levels of KIF18A have been observed in various types of cancer, indicating its potential involvement in tumour progression. Although preclinical studies have demonstrated that KIF18A is not essential for normal somatic cell division, it appears to be crucial for the survival and division of cancer cells, particularly those exhibiting chromosomal instability. This dependency makes KIF18A a promising target for developing new therapeutic strategies aimed at treating chromosomally unstable cancers.

          "abstract": "In early-stage, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), immune cell infiltration contributes to cancer cell survival, tumor invasion, and metastasis. High TNBC glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in early-stage TNBC is associated with poor long-term outcomes; it is unknown if high GR expression is associated with an immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment. We hypothesized that high tumor GR expression would be associated with an immune-suppressed tumor microenvironment, which could thus account for the poor prognosis observed in GR-positive TNBC. Formalin fixed-paraffin embedded tissue (n\u2009=\u200947) from patients diagnosed with early-stage TNBC from The University of Chicago (2002-2014) were evaluated for both tumor cell anti-GR immunohistochemistry and for infiltrating immune cells by immunofluorescence. Multiplexed antibodies were used to enumerate CD8+, FOXP3+, and BATF3+ immune cells infiltrating within pan-cytokeratin positive tumor cell regions of interest, and nonparametric tests compared absolute counts of each of these tumor-infiltrating immune cell types. The average age of patients represented in this study was 52\u00a0years, and 63% self-identified as Black. There was no significant association between tumor GR expression and age, race, or clinical stage at diagnosis. Compared to GR-low tumors, high GR expression in early-stage, treatment-na\u00efve TNBC was associated with relatively increased numbers of immunosuppressive FOXP3 + regulatory T cells (p\u2009=\u20090.046) and BATF3+immune cells (p\u2009=\u20090.021). While there was a positive correlation with high GR expression and CD8+ cell infiltration, it was not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.068). The ratio of CD8+/FOXP3+cells was also not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.24). These data support the hypothesis that in early-stage TNBC, high GR expression is significantly associated with infiltration of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, suggesting a tumor-intrinsic role in shaping the immunosuppressive immune cell milieu. Furthermore, suppression of GR activity may regulate the tumor immune microenvironment and improve long-term outcomes in GR-high TNBC.",

Network analysis of POLE showed interaction of this protein in biological processes such as DNA repair, the cell proliferation cycle, and mechanisms of resistance to platinum. Immune infiltration analysis showed that T cell CD8+, T cell memory activated CD4+, T cell follicular helper, T cell gamma delta and macrophage M1 were more infiltrated in EC <i>POLE</i>mut tumors.

The emergence of multi-institution sequencing data presents a powerful resource for learning real-world evidence to enhance precision oncology. GENIE BPC, led by American Association for Cancer Research, establishes a unique database linking genomic data with clinical information for patients treated at multiple cancer centers. However, leveraging sequencing data from multiple institutions presents significant challenges. Variability in gene panels can lead to loss of information when analyses focus on genes common across panels. Additionally, differences in sequencing techniques and patient heterogeneity across institutions add complexity. High data dimensionality, sparse gene mutation patterns, and weak signals at the individual gene level further complicate matters. Motivated by these real-world challenges, we introduce the Bridge model. It uses a quantile-matched latent variable approach to derive integrated features to preserve information beyond common genes and maximize the utilization of all available data, while leveraging information sharing to enhance both learning efficiency and the model's capacity to generalize. By extracting harmonized and noise-reduced lower-dimensional latent variables, the true mutation pattern unique to each individual is captured. We assess model's performance and parameter estimation through extensive simulation studies. The extracted latent features from the Bridge model consistently excel in predicting patient survival across six cancer types in GENIE BPC data.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, the expansion of molecularly targeted cancer therapies has significantly advanced precision oncology. Parallel developments in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have also improved precision oncology applications, making genomic analysis of tumors more affordable and accessible. Targeted NGS panels now enable the rapid identification of diverse actionable mutations, requiring clinicians to efficiently assess the predictive value of cancer biomarkers for specific treatments. The urgency for timely and accurate decision-making in oncology emphasizes the importance of reliable precision oncology software. Online clinical decision-making tools and associated cancer databases have been designed by consolidating genomic data into standardized, accessible formats. These new platforms are highly integrated and crucial for identifying actionable somatic genomic biomarkers essential for tumor survival, determining corresponding drug targets, and selecting appropriate treatments based on the mutational profile of each patient's tumor. To help oncologists and translational cancer researchers unfamiliar with these tools, we review the utility, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of several commonly used precision medicine software options currently available. Our analysis categorized selected genomic databases based on their primary content, utility, and how well they provide practical guidance for interpreting somatic biomarker data. We identified several comprehensive, mostly open-access platforms that are easy to use for genetic biomarker searches, each with unique features and limitations. Among the precision oncology tools we evaluated, we found MyCancerGenome and OncoKB to be the first choice, offering comprehensive, accurate up-to-date information on the clinical significance of somatic mutations. To illustrate the application of these precision oncology tools in clinical settings, we evaluated three case studies to see how use of the platforms could have influenced treatment planning. Most of the precision oncology software evaluated could be easily streamlined into clinical workflows to provide updated information on approved drugs and clinical trials related the actionable mutations detected. Some platforms were very intuitive and easy to use, while others, often developed in smaller academic settings, were more difficult to navigate and may not be updated consistently. Future enhancements, incorporating artificial intelligence algorithms, are likely to improve integration of the platforms with diverse big data sources, enabling more accurate predictions of potential therapeutic responses.",

Increasing evidence suggests that PPARs are closely associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, the exact role of PPARs in energy metabolism and cancer stem cell (CSC) proliferation remains unclear. This study investigated the role of PPARs in energy metabolism and tumorigenesis in ovarian CSCs. The expression of PPARs and fatty acid consumption as an energy source increased in spheroids derived from A2780 ovarian cancer cells (A2780-SP) compared with their parental cells. GW6471, a PPAR\u03b1 inhibitor, induced apoptosis in A2780-SP. PPAR\u03b1 silencing mediated by small hairpin RNA reduced A2780-SP cell proliferation. Treatment with GW6471 significantly inhibited the respiratory oxygen consumption of A2780-SP cells, with reduced dependency on fatty acids, glucose, and glutamine. In a xenograft tumor transplantation mouse model, intraperitoneal injection of GW6471 inhibited in vivo tumor growth of A2780-SP cells. These results suggest that PPAR\u03b1 plays a vital role in regulating the proliferation and energy metabolism of CSCs by altering mitochondrial activity and that it offers a promising therapeutic target to eradicate CSCs.",

          "abstract": "Ubiquitously distributed environmental electrophiles covalently modify DNA and proteins, potentially leading to adverse health effects. However, the impacts of specific electrophiles on target proteins and their physiological roles remain largely unknown. In the present study, we focused on DNA methylation, which regulates gene expression and physiological responses. A total of 45 environmental electrophiles were screened for inhibitory effects on the activity of DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B), a key enzyme in DNA methylation, and four compounds were identified. We focused on 1,2-naphthoquinone (1,2-NQ), an air pollutant whose toxicity has been reported previously. Interestingly, we found that 1,2-NQ modified multiple lysine and histidine residues in DNMT3B, one of which was near the active site in DNMT3B. It was found that 1,2-NQ altered gene expression and evoked inflammatory responses in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Furthermore, we found that 1,2-NQ upregulated <i>CXCL8</i> expression through DNA demethylation of the distal enhancer and promoted cancer cell growth. Our study reveals novel mechanisms of epigenetic regulation by environmental electrophiles through the inhibition of DNMT3B activity and suggests their physiological impact.",

          "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) poses a significant global health challenge, particularly due to its progression into aggressive forms like neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). This study developed and validated a stemness-associated gene signature using advanced machine learning techniques, including Random Forest and Lasso regression, applied to large-scale transcriptomic datasets. The resulting seven-gene signature (<i>KMT5C</i>, <i>DPP4</i>, <i>TYMS</i>, <i>CDC25B</i>, <i>IRF5</i>, <i>MEN1</i>, and <i>DNMT3B</i>) was validated across independent cohorts and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. This signature demonstrated strong prognostic value for progression-free, disease-free, relapse-free, metastasis-free, and overall survival. Importantly, the signature not only identified specific NEPC subtypes, such as large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, which is associated with very poor outcomes, but also predicted a poor prognosis for PCa cases that exhibit this molecular signature, even when they were not histopathologically classified as NEPC. This dual prognostic and classifier capability makes the seven-gene signature a robust tool for personalized medicine, providing a valuable resource for predicting disease progression and guiding treatment strategies in PCa management.",

Current treatment strategies have failed to significantly improve the prognosis for MM patients. This study aims to identify therapeutic targets and develop combination strategies by investigating the mechanisms underlying the tumorigenesis and progression of MM. We analyzed the copy number amplification of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (<i>EZH2</i>) in 547 melanoma patients and investigated its correlation with clinical prognosis. Utilizing cell lines, organoids, and patient-derived xenograft models, we assessed the impact of <i>EZH2</i> on cell proliferation and sensitivity to ferroptosis. Further, we explored the mechanisms of ferroptosis resistance associated with <i>EZH2</i> by conducting RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. <i>EZH2</i> copy number amplification was closely associated with malignant phenotype and poor prognosis in MM patients. <i>EZH2</i> was essential for MM cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, genetic perturbation of <i>EZH2</i> rendered MM cells sensitized to ferroptosis. Combination treatment of <i>EZH2</i> inhibitor with ferroptosis inducer significantly inhibited the growth of MM. Mechanistically, <i>EZH2</i> inhibited the expression of Kr\u00fcpple-Like factor 14 (<i>KLF14</i>), which binds to the promoter of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (<i>SLC7A11</i>) to repress its transcription. Loss of <i>EZH2</i> therefore reduced the expression of <i>SLC7A11</i>, leading to reduced intracellular <i>SLC7A11</i>-dependent glutathione synthesis to promote ferroptosis. Our findings not only establish <i>EZH2</i> as a biomarker for MM prognosis but also highlight the <i>EZH2-KLF14-SLC7A11</i> axis as a potential target for MM treatment.",

This study aimed to evaluate histopathologic features in SOC, correlating these with prognostic outcomes, and explore the potential clinical implications. We analysed 51 SOC cases for lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), tumour border configuration (TBC), microvessel density (MVD), tumour budding (TB), the tumour-stroma ratio (TSR), the stromal type, tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). A validation cohort of 54 SOC cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used for comparison. In the discovery set, significant predictors of aggressive behaviour included LVSI, high MVD, high TB, and low TILs. These findings were validated in the validation set where the absence of TLSs, lower peritumoural TILs, immature stromal type, and low TSR were associated with worse survival outcomes. The stromal type was identified as an independent prognostic predictor in SOC across both datasets. Inter-observer variability analysis demonstrated substantial to almost perfect agreement for these features, ensuring the reproducibility of the findings. The histopathological evaluation of immune and stromal features, such as TILs, TLSs, TB, TSR, and stromal type, provides critical prognostic information for SOC. Incorporating these markers into routine pathological assessments could enhance risk stratification and guide treatment, offering practical utility, particularly in low-resource settings when molecular testing is not feasible.",

By annotating 705,241 radiology reports, MSK-CHORD also uncovers predictors of metastasis to specific organ sites, including a relationship between SETD2 mutation and lower metastatic potential in immunotherapy-treated lung adenocarcinoma corroborated in independent datasets. We demonstrate the feasibility of automated annotation from unstructured notes and its utility in predicting patient outcomes.

However, the relevance of PTTG1 in tumour prognosis, immunotherapy response, and medication sensitivity in human pan-cancer has to be determined. TIMER, GEPIA, the human protein atlas, GEPIA, TISCH2, and cBioportal examined the gene expression, protein expression, prognostic value, and genetic modification landscape of PTTG1 in 33 malignancies based on the TCGA cohort. The association between PTTG1 and tumour immunity, tumour microenvironment, immunotherapy response, and anticancer drug sensitivity was investigated using GSCA, TIDE, and CellMiner CDB. Molecular docking was used to validate the possible chemotherapeutic medicines for PTTG1. Additionally, siRNA-mediated knockdown was employed to confirm the probable role of PTTG1 in paclitaxel-resistant cells. PTTG1 is overexpressed and associated with poor survival in most tumors. Functional enrichment study revealed that PTTG1 is involved in the cell cycle and DNA replication. A substantial connection between PTTG1 expression and immune cell infiltration points to PTTG1's possible role in the tumour microenvironment. High PTTG1 expression is associated with tumour immunotherapy resistance. The process could be connected to PTTG1, which mediates T cell exhaustion and promotes cytotoxic T lymphocyte malfunction. Furthermore, PTTG1 was found to be substantially linked with sensitivity to several anticancer medications. Suppressing PTTG1 with siRNA reduced clone formation and migration, implying that PTTG1 may play a role in paclitaxel resistance. PTTG1 shows potential as a cancer diagnostic, prognostic, and chemosensitivity marker. Increased PTTG1 expression is linked to resistance to cancer treatment. The mechanism could be linked to PTTG1's role in promoting cytotoxic T lymphocyte dysfunction and mediating T cell exhaustion. It is feasible to consider PTTG1, which is expressed on Treg and Tprolif cells, as a new therapeutic target for overcoming immunotherapy resistance.",

Lung cancer is broadly categorized into small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the latter being most prevalent. The primary histological subtypes of NSCLC are lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). In the present work, we primarily extracted mRNA count data from a publicly accessible database followed by differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed mitophagy-related genes (DEMRGs) identification in case of both LUAD and LUSC cohorts. Next, we identified important DEMRGs via clustering approach followed by enrichment, survival, and mutational analyses. Lastly, the finalized prognostic biomarker was validated using wet-lab experimentations. Primarily, we obtained 986 and 1714 DEGs across LUAD and LUSC cohorts. Only 7 DEMRGs from both cohorts had significant membership values as indicated by the clustering analysis. Most significant pathway, Gene Ontology (GO)-biological process (BP), GO-molecular function (MF), GO-cellular compartment (CC) terms were macroautophagy, GTP metabolic process, magnesium ion binding, mitochondrial outer membrane. Among all, only <i>TDRKH</i> reported significant overall survival (OS) and 14% amplification across LUAD patients. Lastly, we validated <i>TDRKH</i> via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In conclusion, our findings advocate for the exploration of <i>TDRKH</i> and their genetic alterations in precision oncology therapeutic approaches for LUAD, emphasizing the potential for target-driven therapy and early diagnostics<i>.</i> The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-024-04127-y.",

          "abstract": "The initial step in pre-mRNA splicing involves formation of a spliceosome commitment complex (CC) or E-complex by factors that serve to bind and mark the exon-intron boundaries that will undergo splicing. The CC component U1 snRNP assembles at the 5'-splice site (ss), whereas SF1, U2AF2, and U2AF1 define the 3'-ss of the intron. A PRP40 protein bridges U1 snRNP with factors at the 3'-ss. To determine how defects in CC components impact cancers, we analyzed human gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patient tissue and clinical data from cBioPortal. cBioPortal datasets were analyzed for CC factor alterations and patient outcomes in GI cancers (bowel, stomach, esophagus, pancreas, and liver). In addition, co-expression datasets were used to determine the splicing targets of the CC. Our analysis found that frequency of genetic changes was low (1%-13%), but when combined with changes in expression levels, there was an overall surprisingly high incidence of CC component (>30%) alterations in GI cancers. Colon cancer patients carrying <i>BRAF</i> driver gene mutations had high incidences of CC alterations (19%-61%), whereas patients with <i>APC</i>, <i>KRAS</i>, or <i>TP53</i> gene mutations had low (<5%) incidences of CC alterations. Most significantly, patients with mutations in CC genes exhibited a consistent trend of favorable survival rates, indicating that mutations that impair or lower CC component expression favor patient survival. Conversely, patients with high CC expression had worse survival. Pathway analysis indicates that the CC regulates specific metabolic and tumor suppressor pathways. Metabolic pathways involved in cell survival, nutrition, biosynthesis, autophagy, cellular movement (invasion), or immune surveillance pathways correlated with CC factor upregulation, whereas tumor suppressor pathways, which regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis, were inversely correlated with CC factor upregulation. This study demonstrates the versatility of in silico analysis to determine molecular function of large macromolecular complexes such as the spliceosome CC. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that therapeutic lowering of CC levels in colon cancer patients may enhance patient survival.",

Here, we report a rare case of a <i>TP63</i>-associated disease identified through this NBS program. Dried blood spots from newborns were initially screened for TREC/KREC levels, and those with values below the cut-off underwent confirmatory testing and further genetic analysis, including whole-exome sequencing (WES). A male newborn was identified with significantly reduced TREC values, indicative of T cell lymphopenia. Genetic analysis revealed a heterozygous NM_003722.5:c.1027C>T variant in <i>TP63</i>, leading to the p.(Arg343Trp) substitution within the DNA binding domain. This mutation has been previously associated with Ectrodactyly-Ectodermal Dysplasia-Cleft lip/palate syndrome (EEC) syndrome and shown to reduce the transactivation activity of TP63 in a dominant-negative manner. This case represents one of the few instances of immune system involvement in a patient with a <i>TP63</i> mutation, highlighting the need for further investigation into the immunological aspects of <i>TP63</i>-associated disorders. Our findings suggest that comprehensive immunological evaluation should be considered for patients with <i>TP63</i> mutations to better understand and manage potential immune dysfunctions.",

          "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment of brain metastases has become a focus in the development of immunotherapeutic drugs. However, countless patients with brain metastasis have not experienced clinical benefit. Thus, understanding the immune cell composition within brain metastases and how immune cells interact with each other and other microenvironmental cell types may be critical for optimizing immunotherapy. We applied spatial whole-transcriptomic profiling with extensive multiregional sampling (19-30 regions per sample) and multiplex IHC on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung cancer brain metastasis samples. We performed deconvolution of gene expression data to infer the abundances of immune cell populations and inferred spatial relationships from the multiplex IHC data. We also described cytokine networks between immune and tumor cells and used a protein language model to predict drug-target interactions. Finally, we performed deconvolution of bulk RNA data to assess the prognostic significance of immune-metastatic tumor cellular networks. We show that immune cell infiltration has a negative prognostic role in lung cancer brain metastases. Our in-depth multiomics analyses further reveal recurring intratumoral immune heterogeneity and the segregation of myeloid and lymphoid cells into distinct compartments that may be influenced by distinct cytokine networks. By using computational modeling, we identify drugs that may target genes expressed in both tumor core and regions bordering immune infiltrates. Finally, we illustrate the potential negative prognostic role of our immune-metastatic tumor cell networks. Our findings advocate for a paradigm shift from focusing on individual genes or cell types toward targeting networks of immune and tumor cells. Immune cell signatures are conserved across lung cancer brain metastases, and immune-metastatic tumor cell networks have a prognostic effect, implying that targeting cytokine networks between immune and metastatic tumor cells may generate more precise immunotherapeutic approaches.",

The resulting 7-gene signature (<i>KMT5C, MEN1, TYMS, IRF5, DNMT3B, CDC25B and DPP4</i>) was validated across independent cohorts and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. The signature demonstrated strong prognostic value for progression-free, disease-free, relapse-free, metastasis-free, and overall survival. Importantly, the signature not only identified specific NEPC subtypes, such as large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, which is associated with very poor outcomes, but also predicted a poor prognosis for PCa cases that exhibit this molecular signature, even when they were not histopathologically classified as NEPC. This dual prognostic and classifier capability makes the 7-gene signature a robust tool for personalized medicine, providing a valuable resource for predicting disease progression and guiding treatment strategies in PCa management.",

          "abstract": "Prostate cancer is a disease with heterogeneous characteristics, making its treatability and curability dependent on the cancer's stage. While prostate cancer is often indolent, some cases can be aggressive and evolve into metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), which is lethal. A significant subset of individuals with mCRPC exhibit germline and somatic variants in components of the DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway. Recently, PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have shown promise in treating mCRPC patients who carry deleterious alterations in BRCA2 and 13 other DDR genes that are important for the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway. These inhibitors function by trapping PARP, resulting in impaired PARP activity and increased DNA damage, ultimately leading to cell death through synthetic lethality. However, the response to these inhibitors only lasts for 3-4 months, after which the cancer becomes\u00a0PARPi resistant. Cancer cells can develop resistance to PARPi through numerous mechanisms, such as secondary reversion mutations in DNA repair pathway genes, heightened drug efflux, loss of PARP expression, HRR reactivation, replication fork stability, and upregulation of Wnt/Catenin and ABCB1 pathways. Overcoming\u00a0PARPi resistance is a critical and complex process, and there are two possible ways to sensitize the resistance. The first approach is to potentiate the\u00a0PARPi agents through chemo/radiotherapy and combination therapy, while the second approach entails targeting different signaling pathways. This review article highlights the latest evidence on the resistance mechanism of\u00a0PARPi in lethal prostate cancer and discusses additional therapeutic opportunities available for prostate cancer patients with DDR gene alterations who do not respond to\u00a0PARPi.",

Currently, somatic mutations are used for tracing the dynamics of the tumor via LB. However, the analysis of the dynamic changes in the molecular signatures such as microsatellite instability (MSI) is not currently used. We hypothesized that changes in blood MSI burden (bMSI) could be registered using serial LB sampling in the course of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), and that its changes could potentially correlate with treatment outcomes. We report the preliminary findings of the observational trial launched to study (NCT06414304) the dynamics of bMSI in 9 MSI-positive CRC patients receiving ICI. NGS-based MSI testing was performed on both pre-treatment FFPE and serial LB samples. For patients who had detectable bMSI burden in any of the LB samples (n\u2009=\u20098, 89%), median bMSI was 1.4% (range, 0.01-40%). Among patients with detectable MSI in available FFPE samples, median MSI burden was 29.3% (range, 10-40%). bMSI detected in baseline LB and FFPE samples were positively correlated (Pearson's R 0.47). Maximal variant allele frequencies of driver mutations observed in LB were also positively correlated with bMSI burden (Pearson's R 0.7). Patients who had clinical benefit had undetectable bMSI burden at follow-up. Our results provide the rationale for further validation of bMSI as a predictive biomarker of ICI in MSI-positive patients.",

Despite medical advancement, the prognosis for advanced-stage patients remains extremely low due to high recurrence rates and resistance to existing treatments. Thereby, the search for potential prognostic biomarkers is heightened to unravel new modalities of CC pathogenesis and to develop novel anti-cancer therapies. Epitranscriptomic modifications, reversible epigenetic RNA modifications, regulate various biological processes by deciding RNA fate to mediating RNA interactions. This narrative review provides insight into the cellular and molecular roles of endogenous RNA-editing proteins and their associated epitranscriptomic modifications, especially <i>N<sup>6</sup></i>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A), 5-methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C) and <i>N<sup>1</sup></i>-methyladenosine (m<sup>1</sup>A), in governing the development, progression and metastasis of CC.

Additionally, we provided a concise overview of the therapeutic potential of targeting the altered expression of endogenous RNA-editing proteins and aberrant deposition of RNA modifications on both coding and non-coding RNAs in CC.",

We demonstrate that these models capture the cellular and molecular complexity of human disease and reveal key factors shaping the tumor microenvironment and influencing ICB response. BR1-responsive tumor cells express inflammatory programs that polarize microglia into reactive states, eliciting robust T cell recruitment. In contrast, BR3-resistant melanoma cells are enriched in neurological programs and exploit tolerance mechanisms to maintain microglia homeostasis and limit T cell infiltration. In humans, BR1 and BR3 expression signatures correlate positively or negatively with T cell infiltration and BrM patient outcomes, respectively.

Increasing CIN above a maximally tolerated threshold leads to cell death due to loss of essential chromosomes. Here, we show in two tissue contexts that otherwise isogenic cancer cells with higher levels of CIN are more sensitive to ionizing radiation, which itself induces CIN. CIN also sensitizes HPV-positive and HPV-negative head and neck cancer patient derived xenograft (PDX) tumors to radiation. Moreover, laryngeal cancers with higher CIN prior to treatment show improved response to radiation therapy. In addition, we reveal a novel mechanism of radiosensitization by docetaxel, a microtubule stabilizing drug commonly used in combination with radiation. Docetaxel causes cell death by inducing CIN due to abnormal multipolar spindles rather than causing mitotic arrest, as previously assumed. Docetaxel-induced CIN, rather than mitotic arrest, is responsible for the enhanced radiation sensitivity observed in vitro and in vivo, challenging the mechanistic dogma of the last 40 years. These results implicate CIN as a potential biomarker and inducer of radiation response, which could provide valuable cancer therapeutic opportunities. Cancer cells and laryngeal tumors with higher chromosome missegregation rates are more sensitive to radiation therapy, supporting chromosomal instability as a promising biomarker of radiation response.",

          "abstract": "Rare genetic variants can have strong effects on phenotypes, yet accounting for rare variants in genetic analyses is statistically challenging due to the limited number of allele carriers and the burden of multiple testing. While rich variant annotations promise to enable well-powered rare variant association tests, methods integrating variant annotations in a data-driven manner are lacking. Here we propose deep rare variant association testing (DeepRVAT), a model based on set neural networks that learns a trait-agnostic gene impairment score from rare variant annotations and phenotypes, enabling both gene discovery and trait prediction. On 34 quantitative and 63 binary traits, using whole-exome-sequencing data from UK Biobank, we find that DeepRVAT yields substantial gains in gene discoveries and improved detection of individuals at high genetic risk. Finally, we demonstrate how DeepRVAT enables calibrated and computationally efficient rare variant tests at biobank scale, aiding the discovery of genetic risk factors for human disease traits.",

This study was designed to evaluate the extent to which genetic alterations of the PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR can predict protein activation of this signalling axis in MBCs. Molecular profiles were generated by CLIA-certified laboratories from a real-world evidence cohort of 171 MBC patients. Genetic alterations of the PIK3CA pathway were measured using next-generation sequencing. Activation levels of AKT and downstream signalling molecules were quantified using two orthogonal proteomic methods. Protein activity was correlated with underlying genomic profiles and response to CDK4/6 inhibition in combination with endocrine treatment (ET). Oncogenic alterations of the PIK3CA/AKT/PTEN pathway were identified in 49.7% of cases. Genomic profiles emerged as poor predictors of protein activity (AUC:0.69), and AKT phosphorylation levels mimicked those of mutant lesions in 76.9% of wild-type tumours. High phosphorylation levels of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR downstream target p70S6 Kinase (T389) were associated with shorter PFS in patients treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with ET (HR:4.18 95%CI:1.19-14.63); this association was not seen when patients were classified by mutational status. Phosphoprotein-based measurements of drug targets and downstream substrates should be captured along with genomic information to identify MBCs driven by the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling.",

Claudins are transmembrane proteins that form the tight junction, and their expression is reduced in aggressive breast tumors. However, claudins' roles during breast cancer metastasis remain unclear. We used gain- and loss-of-function genetics in organoids isolated from murine breast cancer models to establish that Cldn7 suppresses invasion and metastasis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Cldn7 knockdown induced smooth muscle actin (SMA)-related genes and a broader mesenchymal phenotype. We validated our results in human cell lines, fresh human tumor tissue, bulk RNA-seq, and public single-cell RNA-seq data. We consistently observed an inverse relationship between Cldn7 expression and expression of SMA-related genes. Furthermore, knockdown and overexpression of SMA-related genes demonstrated that they promote breast cancer invasion. Our data reveal that Cldn7 suppresses breast cancer invasion and metastasis through negative regulation of SMA-related and mesenchymal gene expression.",

Hispanic people constitute approximately 19% of the nation's total population according to the US Census. Hispanic patients have the highest relative incidence rates of liver cancer compared to non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks, a disparity frequently overlooked in cancer research. In this study, our primary objective was to analyze the potential underrepresentation of Hispanic individuals in liver cancer research databases. We identified databases that had liver cancer-specific studies and be population-based in the United States. Our search yielded 7 cancer genomic databases, which were analyzed according to incidence percentages across ethnicity and race categories. Our study included 3104 patients; ethnic data was not reported for 13.1% (n\u2009=\u2009406) of the patients. Samples were predominantly from individuals who identified as Not Hispanic (81.0%), Hispanic individuals represented 5.9%. Race was reported as follows: non-Hispanic Whites (61.0%), Asians (22.0%), non-Hispanic Blacks (5.4%), Other (3.1%), Native American/American Indian/Alaska Native (0.4%), Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian (0.2%) and not reported (7.9%). These findings collectively underscore significant disparities in the representation of ethnic and racial groups, particularly Hispanics. Given the present racial and ethnic demographics of the US population and the projected surge in the Hispanic population in forthcoming years, it becomes imperative to address health disparities that may worsen without efforts to enhance proper inclusion in cancer research.",

A comprehensive analysis of their mutation patterns and significant gene ontology terms can provide insights into cancer emergence and suggest potential targets for drug development. This study analyzes twelve cancer subtypes by focusing on significant genetic and molecular factors. Two common genetic mutations associated with cancer are single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number alterations (CNAs). Oncogenes, derived from mutated proto-oncogenes, disrupt normal cell functions and promote cancer, while tumor suppressor genes, often inactivated by mutations, regulate cell processes like proliferation and DNA damage response. This study analyzed datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which provides extensive genomic data across various cancers. In our analysis results, many genes with significant <i>p</i>-values based on Kaplan Meier gene expression data were identified in eight cancers (BRCA, BLCA, HNSC, KIRC, LUAD, KIRP, LUSC, STAD). Moreover, STAD is the only cancer for genes with both significant <i>p</i>-values and functional terms reported. Interestingly, we found that LIHC was the cancer reported with only one CNA mutated gene and its survival plot <i>p</i>-value being significant. Additionally, KICH has no reported significant genes at all. Our study proposed the relationship between tumor suppressor and oncogenes and shed light on cancer tumorigenesis due to genetic mutations.",

We used quantitative mass spectrometry (SWATH MS) to identify differentially expressed proteins in paired CRC cell models of the SW480 and SW620 cell lines in response to AGR2 protein level manipulation. Relying on the results from SWATH MS and subsequent immunochemical validation, we selected NMP3 as the top candidate protein associated with AGR2 in CRC tumour cells in our screen. RT\u2012qPCR and immunochemical analysis confirmed the involvement of AGR2-mediated regulation of NPM3 at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Since PD-L1 is a constituent of the NPM3 regulatory axis, we aimed to correlate the changes in PD-L1 to the differential expression of AGR2 in our cell models. We found that AGR2 positively regulates PD-L1 levels in both SW480 and SW620 cell lines; additionally, several different CRC patient transcriptome cohorts confirmed the association of AGR2 with PD-L1. Our work reveals a new AGR2-NPM3 regulatory axis and the involvement of AGR2 in the regulation of PD-L1, which paves the way for the association of AGR2 with immune evasion in CRC cells.",

          "abstract": "Amivantamab is an FDA-approved bispecific antibody targeting EGF and Met receptors, with clinical activity against EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Amivantamab efficacy has been demonstrated to be linked to three mechanisms of action (MOA): immune cell-mediated killing, receptor internalization and degradation, and inhibition of ligand binding to both EGFR and Met receptors. Among the EGFR ligands, we demonstrated that amphiregulin (AREG) is highly expressed in wild-type (WT) EGFR (EGFR<sup>WT</sup>) NSCLC primary tumors, with significantly higher circulating protein levels in NSCLC patients than in healthy volunteers. Treatment of AREG-stimulated EGFR<sup>WT</sup> cells/tumors with amivantamab or with an AREG-targeting antibody inhibited ligand-induced signaling and cell/tumor proliferation/growth. Across 11 EGFR<sup>WT</sup> NSCLC patient-derived xenograft models, amivantamab efficacy correlated with AREG RNA levels. Interestingly, in these models, amivantamab anti-tumor activity was independent of Fc engagement with immune cells, suggesting that, in this context, the ligand-blocking function is sufficient for amivantamab maximal efficacy. Finally, we demonstrated that in lung adenocarcinoma patients, high expression of AREG and EGFR mutations were mutually exclusive. In conclusion, these data 1) highlight EGFR ligand AREG as a driver of tumor growth in some EGFR<sup>WT</sup> NSCLC models, 2) illustrate the preclinical efficacy of amivantamab in ligand-driven EGFR<sup>WT</sup> NSCLC, and 3) identify AREG as a potential predictive biomarker for amivantamab activity in EGFR<sup>WT</sup> NSCLC.",

The terminal unfolded protein response (UPR) is an emerging anti-cancer approach, although its role in pediatric T-ALL remains unclear. In our pediatric T-ALL cohort from different centers, a lower QRICH1 expression was found associated with a worse prognosis of pediatric T-ALL. Overexpression of QRICH1 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and stimulated apoptosis of T-ALL both in vitro and in vivo. Upregulation of QRICH1 significantly downregulated 78 KDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) and upregulated CHOP, thus activating the terminal UPR. Co-overexpression of GRP78 in T-ALL cells overexpressing QRICH1 partially reverted the inhibited proliferation and stimulated apoptosis. QRICH1 bound to the residues Asp212 and Glu155 of the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of GRP78, thereby inhibiting its ATP hydrolysis activity. In addition, QRICH1 was associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in T-ALL, and overexpression of QRICH1 reversed drug resistance. Overall, low QRICH1 expression is an independent risk factor for a poor prognosis of pediatric T-ALL. By inhibiting GRP78, QRICH1 suppresses pediatric T-ALL.",

          "abstract": "Tumour dormancy, a resistance mechanism employed by cancer cells, is a significant challenge in cancer treatment, contributing to minimal residual disease (MRD) and potential relapse. Despite its clinical importance, the mechanisms underlying tumour dormancy and MRD remain unclear. In this study, we employed two syngeneic murine models of myeloid leukemia and melanoma to investigate the genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic and protein signatures associated with tumour dormancy. We used a multiomics approach to elucidate the molecular mechanisms driving MRD and identify potential therapeutic targets. We conducted an in-depth omics analysis encompassing whole-exome sequencing (WES), copy number variation (CNV) analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), transcriptome and proteome investigations. WES analysis revealed a modest overlap of gene mutations between melanoma and leukemia dormancy models, with a significant number of mutated genes found exclusively in dormant cells. These exclusive genetic signatures suggest selective pressure during MRD, potentially conferring resistance to the microenvironment or therapies. CNV, histone marks and transcriptomic gene expression signatures combined with Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis highlighted the potential functional roles of the mutated genes, providing insights into the pathways associated with MRD. In addition, we compared \"murine MRD genes\" profiles to the corresponding human disease through public datasets and highlighted common features according to disease progression. Proteomic analysis combined with multi-omics genetic investigations, revealed a dysregulated proteins signature in dormant cells with minimal genetic mechanism involvement. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed the metabolic, differentiation and cytoskeletal remodeling processes involved in MRD. Finally, we identified 11 common proteins differentially expressed in dormant cells from both pathologies. Our study underscores the complexity of tumour dormancy, implicating both genetic and nongenetic factors. By comparing genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic datasets, our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular landscape of minimal residual disease. These results provide a robust foundation for forthcoming investigations and offer potential avenues for the advancement of targeted MRD therapies in leukemia and melanoma patients, emphasizing the importance of considering both genetic and nongenetic factors in treatment strategies.",

          "abstract": "<i>CTNNB1</i> pathogenic variants are related to the improper functioning of the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway, promoting the development of different types of cancer of somatic origin. Bioinformatics analyses of genetic variation are a great tool to understand the possible consequences of these variants on protein structure and function and their probable implication in pathologies. The objective of this study is to describe the impact of the missense variants of uncertain significance (VUS) of the <i>CTNNB1</i> gene on structure and function of the \u03b2-catenin protein. The <i>CTNNB1</i> variants were obtained from the GnomAD v2.1.1 database; subsequently, a bioinformatic analysis was performed using the VarSome, UCSC Genome Browser, UniProt, the Kinase Library database, and DynaMut2 platforms to evaluate clinical significance, gene conservation, consensus sites for post-translational modifications, and the dynamics and stability of proteins. The GnomAD v2.1.1 database included 826 variants of the <i>CTNNB1</i> gene, of which 385 were in exons and exon/intron boundaries. Among these variants, 214 were identified as missense, of which 146 were classified as VUS. Notably, 12 variants were in proximity to consensus sites for post-translational modifications (PTMs). The in silico analysis showed a slight tendency towards probably pathogenic for c.59C>T (p.Ala20Val) and c.983T>C (p.Met328Thr) missense VUS. These findings provide possible functional implications of these variants in some types of cancer.",

Recent studies have highlighted the potential prognostic value of evaluating the tumor microenvironment, including the presence of a histologically overt stromal response (HOST-response) characterized by peri-glandular stromal changes and architectural distortions. This retrospective study examined patient records from The Cancer Genome Atlas database to identify genomic alterations associated with the HOST-response in prostate cancer. Among 348 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, 160 (45.98%) were identified as having a HOST-response. A gene expression analysis revealed 1263 genes with significantly higher expression in patients with a HOST-response. A protein-protein interaction network analysis identified seven hub genes (<i>KIF2C, CENPA, CDC20, UBE2C, ESPL1, KIF23,</i> and <i>PLK1</i>) highly interconnected in the network. A functional enrichment analysis revealed alterations in the cell division, cytoskeletal organization, cytokinesis, and interleukin-16 signaling pathways in patients with a HOST-response, suggesting dysregulated proliferation and inflammation. The distinct molecular signature associated with the HOST-response provides insights into the tumor-stroma interactions driving adverse outcomes and potential targets for tailored therapeutic interventions in this subset of patients with prostate cancer.",

          "abstract": "The transcription factor \u0394Np63 plays a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity of stratified epithelial tissues by regulating the expression of distinct target genes involved in lineage specification, cell stemness, cell proliferation and differentiation. Here, we identified the ABC transporter subfamily member <i>ABCC1</i> as a novel \u0394Np63 target gene. We found that in immortalized human keratinocytes and in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells, \u2206Np63 induces the expression of ABCC1 by physically occupying a p63-binding site (p63 BS) located in the first intron of the <i>ABCC1</i> gene locus. In cutaneous SCC and during the activation of the keratinocyte differentiation program, \u2206Np63 and ABCC1 levels are positively correlated raising the possibility that ABCC1 might be involved in the regulation of the proliferative/differentiative capabilities of squamous tissue. However, we did not find any gross alteration in the structure and morphology of the epidermis in humanized <i>hABCC1</i> knock-out mice. Conversely, we found that the genetic ablation of <i>ABCC1</i> led to a marked reduction in inflammation-mediated proliferation of keratinocytes, suggesting that ABCC1 might be involved in the regulation of keratinocyte proliferation upon inflammatory/proliferative signals. In line with these observations, we found a significant increase in ABCC1 expression in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), a tumor type characterized by keratinocyte hyper-proliferation and a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Collectively, these data uncover <i>ABCC1</i> as an additional \u2206Np63 target gene potentially involved in those skin diseases characterized by dysregulation of proliferation/differentiation balance.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer (BRCA) remains a significant global health challenge due to its prevalence and lethality, exacerbated by the development of resistance to conventional therapies. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning chemoresistance is crucial for improving therapeutic outcomes. Human deoxycytidine triphosphate pyrophosphatase 1 (DCTPP1) has emerged as a key player in various cancers, including BRCA. DCTPP1, involved in nucleotide metabolism and maintenance of genomic stability, has been linked to cancer cell proliferation, survival, and drug resistance. This study evaluates the role of DCTPP1 in BRCA prognosis and chemotherapy response. Data from the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repositories, analyzed using GEPIA and Kaplan-Meier Plotter, indicate that high DCTPP1 expression correlates with poorer overall survival and increased resistance to chemotherapy in BRCA patients. Further analysis reveals that <i>DCTPP1</i> gene expression is up-regulated in non-responders to chemotherapy, particularly in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, luminal A subtype patients, with significant predictive power. Additionally, in vitro studies show that <i>DCTPP1</i> gene expression increases in response to 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin treatments in luminal A BRCA cell lines, suggesting a hypothetical role in chemoresistance. These findings highlight DCTPP1 as a potential biomarker for predicting chemotherapy response and as a therapeutic target to enhance chemotherapy efficacy in BRCA patients.",

          "abstract": "Identifying the key molecular pathways that enable metastasis by analyzing the eventual metastatic tumor is challenging because the state of the founder subclone likely changes following metastatic colonization. To address this challenge, we labeled primary mouse pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) subclones with DNA barcodes to characterize their pre-metastatic state using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq and determine their relative <i>in vivo</i> metastatic potential prospectively. We identified a gene signature separating metastasis-high and metastasis-low subclones orthogonal to the normal-to-PDAC and classical-to-basal axes. The metastasis-high subclones feature activation of IL-1 pathway genes and high NF-\u03baB and Zeb/Snail family activity and the metastasis-low subclones feature activation of neuroendocrine, motility, and Wnt pathway genes and high CDX2 and HOXA13 activity. In a functional screen, we validated novel mediators of PDAC metastasis in the IL-1 pathway, including the NF-\u03baB targets <i>Fos</i> and <i>Il23a</i>, and beyond the IL-1 pathway including <i>Myo1b</i> and <i>Tmem40</i>. We scored human PDAC tumors for our signature of metastatic potential from mouse and found that metastases have higher scores than primary tumors. Moreover, primary tumors with higher scores are associated with worse prognosis. We also found that our metastatic potential signature is enriched in other human carcinomas, suggesting that it is conserved across epithelial malignancies. This work establishes a strategy for linking cancer cell state to future behavior, reveals novel functional regulators of PDAC metastasis, and establishes a method for scoring human carcinomas based on metastatic potential.",

Much work remains to understand how to target these tumor-myeloid interactions to improve treatment outcomes. Noncanonical Hedgehog signaling is an essential component of bone metastatic tumor progression, and prior literature suggests a potential role for Hedgehog signaling and its downstream effector Gli2 in modulating immune responses. In this work, we sought to identify if inhibition of noncanonical Hedgehog signaling alters the cytokine profile of osteolytic breast cancer cells and the subsequent communication between the tumor cells and myeloid cells. Examination of large patient databases revealed significant relationships between Gli2 expression and expression of markers of myeloid maturation and activation as well as cytokine expression. We found that treatment with HPI-1 reduced tumor cell expression of numerous cytokine genes, including <i>CSF1</i>, <i>CSF2</i>, and <i>CSF3</i>, as well as <i>CCL2</i> and <i>IL6</i>. Secreted CSF-1 (M-CSF) was also reduced by treatment. Changes in tumor-secreted factors resulted in polarization of THP-1 monocytes toward a proinflammatory phenotype, characterized by increased CD14 and CD40 surface marker expression. We therefore propose M-CSF as a novel target of Hedgehog inhibition with potential future applications in altering the immune microenvironment in addition to its known roles in reducing tumor-induced bone disease.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) participate critically in various physiological and pathological processes through posttranscriptional regulation of downstream genes. Our preliminary findings identified miR-338-5p, potentially linked to metastasis in breast cancer, a previously unexplored area. Analysis of the GSE38867 dataset revealed the decreased miR-338-5p expression in metastatic breast cancer compared to normal tissues. Cellular function experiments and a xenograft tumor model demonstrated the inhibitory function of miR-338-5p on the progression of breast cancer <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Furthermore, it downregulated the expression of mesenchymal biomarkers and NOTCH1 significantly. With the predicting targets of miR-338-5p and transcription factors of the NOTCH1 gene, coupled with dual luciferase reporter assays, it is identified ETS1 as the interactor between miR-338-5p and NOTCH1. In breast cancer tissues, as well as in our xenograft tumor model, expression of ETS1 and NOTCH1 was positively correlated using immunohistochemical staining. This study reports, for the first time, on the miR-338-5p/ETS1/NOTCH1 axis and its pivotal role in breast cancer proliferation and metastasis. These findings propose a novel therapeutic strategy for breast cancer patients and lays a foundation for its clinical detection and treatment evaluation.",

GBM patients have a low survival rate owing to their aggressive nature, poor prognosis, genomic variations among patients, and histopathological differences. In this study, we used several bioinformatics platforms, namely Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Data Analysis Portal (UALCAN) databases, Kaplan-Meier plotter, and cBioPortal, to conduct a comprehensive analysis to highlight the expression of epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) in patients with GBM. Our study highlights EGFR as a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker. According to the TIMER database, EGFR was upregulated in five cancers, including GBM, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, kidney renal cell carcinoma, kidney renal cell papillary cell carcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma, whereas it was downregulated in breast invasive carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, prostate adenocarcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. Our investigation highlighted the expression of EGFR in various clinicopathological parameters, which include age, sex, gender, and TP53 mutation status in patients with GBM. We found that EGFR was upregulated in middle-aged and older adults compared to normal tissues, while it was not significantly downregulated in young adults and older adults. EGFR was upregulated in Caucasians compared to normal tissue, whereas it was downregulated in Asian and African American populations, but this was not statistically significant. In terms of gender, EGFR was upregulated in the male population compared to the female population. Furthermore, EGFR was upregulated in patients with TP53 mutations compared to normal tissues. We also examined the correlation between EGFR gene expression and immune cell infiltration in GBM patients and the impact of EGFR mutations on patient prognosis. Our results revealed a significant positive correlation between EGFR, B cells, and macrophages, but this was not significant for other cell types. This study signified that upregulation of EGFR was associated with a poor prognosis in patients with GBM validated by the GEPIA and UALCAN databases.",

CDK9 is now emerging as a potential therapeutic target for cancer, since its overexpression has been found to correlate with cancer development and worse clinical outcomes.

Many solid cancers also overexpress CDK9 and depend on its activity to promote downstream oncogenic signaling pathways. In this review, we summarize the latest knowledge of CDK9 biology in solid tumors and the studies of small molecule CDK9 inhibitors. We discuss the results of the latest clinical trials of CDK9 inhibitors in solid tumors, with a focus on key issues to consider for improving the therapeutic impact of this drug class.",

          "abstract": "Ribosomal proteins (RPs) play an important role in the overall stability, function, and integrity of ribosomes. Ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4), which is encoded by <i>RPL4</i>, is assumed to play different roles in different cancers due to the strong correlation between them. However, research based on the underlying mechanisms of this correlations is limited. Therefore, this study investigated the biological role of RPL4 in various cancers. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases were used to compare the differential expression of RPL4 in tumor and normal tissues. The Sangerbox database and Kaplan-Meier method were employed to assess RPL4's impact on the prognosis of pan-cancer. Analyses using the cBioPortal tool, Shiny Methylation Analysis Resource Tool (SMART), and MethSurv provided insights into the methylation and epigenetic alterations of <i>RPL4</i>. Gene enrichment analysis revealed that <i>RPL4</i> is involved in ribosome biogenesis through multiple pathways, and its enrichment in signaling pathways directly or indirectly influence tumor development. Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub (TISCH) was used to analyze <i>RPL4</i> expression levels and cellular functions in the tumor microenvironment. Tumor Immune Estimation Resource Database 2.0 (TIMER2.0) and Tumor-Immune System Interactions Database (TISIDB) tools revealed that RPL4 affected the immune infiltration potential of tumors. Furthermore, the application of the ROC mapper and CellMiner databases indicated an association between RPL4 and sensitivity to multiple antitumor drugs. Additionally, RPL4 was found to remodel the tumor immune microenvironment, leading to the development of chemoresistance. In conclusion, the findings suggest that RPL4 can be used as a potential tumor biomarker and may serve as a target for immunotherapy in various cancers. Genetic testing of RPL4 provides a foundation for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of clinical tumors.",

          "abstract": "High-grade gliomas including glioblastoma (GBM) and diffuse midline gliomas (DMG) represent the most lethal and aggressive brain cancers where current treatment modalities offer limited efficacy. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have emerged as a promising strategy, boasting tumor-specific targeting and the unique ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. However, the effective clinical application hinges on the optimal choice of antigen, with a limited number, currently under investigation. We employed cell surface proteomic analysis of primary human high-grade glioma samples from both adult and pediatric patients. This led to the identification of Ephrin type-A receptor 3 (EphA3) as a prevalently expressed target. We engineered a second-generation EphA3-targeted CAR T cell and assessed function using in vitro and in vivo models of GBM and DMG. EphA3-targeted CAR T cells demonstrated robust antigen-specific killing of human GBM and DMG cell lines in vitro. In an orthotopic xenograft NSG mouse model, EphA3-targeted CAR T cells not only effectively eradicated tumors but also established a functional T cell population protective on rechallenge. Remarkably, mice rechallenged with a second contralateral orthotopic tumor implantation achieved complete tumor clearance and maintained a sustained complete response 6\u2009months following initial treatment. Building on the proven safety profile of EphA3 antibodies in clinical settings, our study provides compelling preclinical evidence supporting the efficacy of EphA3-targeted CAR T cells against high-grade gliomas. These findings underscore the potential for transitioning this innovative therapy into clinical trials, aiming to revolutionize the treatment landscape for patients afflicted with these formidable brain cancers.",

          "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is a malignancy arising from the endocrine or exocrine compartment of this organ. Tumors from exocrine origin comprise over 90% of all pancreatic cancers diagnosed. Of these, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common histological subtype. The five-year survival rate for PDAC ranged between 5 and 9% for over four decades, and only recently saw a modest increase to \u223c12-13%, making this a severe and lethal disease. Like other cancers, PDAC initiation stems from genetic changes. However, therapeutic targeting of PDAC genetic drivers has remained relatively unsuccessful, thus the focus in recent years has expanded to the non-genetic factors underlying the disease pathogenesis. Specifically, it has been proposed that dynamic changes in the epigenetic landscape promote tumor growth and metastasis. Emphasis has been given to the re-organization of enhancers, essential regulatory elements controlling oncogenic gene expression, commonly marked my histone 3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1). H3K4me1 is typically deposited by histone lysine methyltransferases (KMTs). While well characterized as oncogenes in other cancer types, recent work has expanded the role of KMTs as tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer. Here, we review the role and translational significance for PDAC development and therapeutics of KMTs.",

We demonstrate that binding and the functional impact of WT and mutant CTCF depend not only on the unique properties of each protein, but also on the genomic context of bound sites. Our studies also highlight the reciprocal relationship between CTCF and chromatin, demonstrating that the unique binding properties of WT and mutant proteins have a distinct impact on accessibility, TF binding, cohesin overlap, chromatin interactivity and gene expression programs, providing insight into their cancer and brain related effects.",

We assessed the association between circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) identified using amplicon sequencing and evidence of recurrence on CT surveillance. A prospective cohort study of NSCLC patients with early-stage disease undergoing curative-intent resection was conducted. Surveillance was performed post-operatively at pre-defined intervals with both liquid biopsy and chest CT imaging. Amplicon panel next-generation sequencing was performed on DNA and RNA from tumor tissue and on plasma cell-free DNA for tumor-informed ctDNA detection. Resected tumors from 78 NSCLC patients were analyzed. Alterations were detected on the DNA assay for 65 tumors and only on the RNA assay for 4 tumors. Of the 65 patients with alterations detected on the tumor DNA assay, 29 completed post-operative liquid biopsy testing. Four of those 29 patients had evidence of recurrence on imaging, of whom two had biopsy confirmation of recurrence and detectable ctDNA at the 12-month follow-up. Molecular confirmation of NSCLC recurrence can be provided through amplicon sequencing of plasma cell-free DNA in cases with imaging evidence of recurrence. Invasive tissue diagnosis may be avoidable in patients with ctDNA confirmation of recurrence that is suspected based on imaging. Further study of ctDNA assessment technologies in the setting of suspected recurrence is necessary to inform post-operative lung cancer surveillance guidelines.",

Somatic copy number alterations showed little variation by smoking status, suggesting that aneuploidy may be a general characteristic of lung cancer regardless of smoke exposure. Similarly, clock-like and APOBEC mutation signatures were prevalent but did not differ in tumors from smokers and never-smokers. However, mutations in both EGFR and KRAS showed unique allelic differences determined by smoking status that are known to alter tumor response to targeted therapy. Mutations in the MYC-network member MGA were more prevalent in tumors from smokers. Fusion events in ALK, RET, and ROS1 were absent, likely due to age-related differences in fusion prevalence. Our work underscores the profound effect of smoking status, age, and sex on the tumor mutational landscape and identifies areas of unmet medical need.",

A total of 73 women diagnosed with ER+/ERBB2- EBC between January 10, 2004, and June 2, 2008, were followed up until December 31, 2022. Univariate and multivariate Cox models were constructed to plot the relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). The log-rank test derived p-value was obtained. For external validation, we performed a survival analysis of 1163 comparable patients retrieved from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset. At follow-up, 16 (21.9%) patients had relapsed, while 21 (nearly 29%) harbored mutant genes. Thirty-three missense mutations were detected in 14 genes. The median ages were 51 and 46\u2009years in patients with and without mutations, respectively. Patients with any mutation had a 1.85-fold higher risk of relapse (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.60-5.69) compared to those without any mutation. Patients who harbored any of the six genes (MAP2K4, FGFR3, APC, KIT, RB1, and PTEN) had a nearly 6-fold increase in the risk of relapse (HR: 5.82, 95% CI: 1.31-18.56; p\u2009=\u20090.0069). Multivariate Cox models revealed that the adjusted HR for RFS and OS were 6.67 (95% CI: 1.32-27.57) and 8.31 (p\u2009=\u20090.0443), respectively. METABRIC analysis also demonstrated a trend to significantly worse RFS (p\u2009=\u20090.0576) in the subcohort grouped by having a mutation in any of the six genes. Our single-institution tissue bank study of Taiwanese women with ER+/ERBB2- EBC suggests that a novel combination of six gene mutations might have prognostic capability for survival outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Nucleoli are large nuclear sub-compartments where vital processes, such as ribosome assembly, take place. Technical obstacles still limit our understanding of the biological functions of nucleolar proteins in cell homeostasis and cancer pathogenesis. Since most nucleolar proteins are essential, their abrogation cannot be achieved through conventional approaches. Additionally, the biological activities of many nucleolar proteins are connected to their physiological concentration. Thus, artificial overexpression might not fully recapitulate their endogenous functions. Proteolysis-based approaches, such as the Auxin Inducible Degron (AID) system paired with CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in gene-editing, have the potential to overcome these limitations, providing unprecedented characterization of the biological activities of endogenous nucleolar proteins. We applied this system to endogenous nucleolin (NCL), one of the most abundant nucleolar proteins, and characterized the impact of its acute depletion on Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cell behavior. Abrogation of endogenous NCL reduced proliferation and caused defective cytokinesis, resulting in bi-nucleated tetraploid cells. Bioinformatic analysis of patient data, and quantitative proteomics using our experimental NCL-depleted model, indicated that NCL levels are correlated with the abundance of proteins involved in chromosomal segregation. In conjunction with its effects on sister chromatid dynamics, NCL abrogation enhanced the anti-proliferative effects of chemical inhibitors of mitotic modulators such as the Anaphase Promoting Complex. In summary, using the AID system in combination with CRISPR/Cas9 for endogenous gene editing, our findings indicate a novel role for NCL in supporting the completion of the cell division in TNBC models, and that its abrogation could enhance the therapeutic activity of mitotic-progression inhibitors.",

Modeling these so-called multi-omic data is especially beneficial in disease analysis, where observations across omic data types may reveal unexpected patient groupings and inform clinical outcomes and treatments. We present Multi-omic Pathway Analysis of Cells (MPAC), a computational framework that interprets multi-omic data through prior knowledge from biological pathways. MPAC leverages network relationships encoded in pathways through a factor graph to infer consensus activity levels for proteins and associated pathway entities from multi-omic data, runs permutation testing to eliminate spurious activity predictions, and groups biological samples by pathway activities to allow identifying and prioritizing proteins with potential clinical relevance, e.g., associated with patient prognosis. Using DNA copy number alteration and RNA-seq data from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas as an example, we demonstrate that MPAC predicts a patient subgroup related to immune responses not identified by analysis with either input omic data type alone. Key proteins identified via this subgroup have pathway activities related to clinical outcome as well as immune cell compositions. Our MPAC R package, available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/MPAC, enables similar multi-omic analyses on new datasets.",

However, due to the volume and inherent complexity of high-throughput omics data, analysis of this is limited by the capacity for performing data processing through programming languages such as R or Python. Existing webtools lack functionality that supports large-scale analysis; typically, users can only input one gene, or a gene list condensed into a gene set, instead of individual gene-level analysis. Furthermore, analysis results are usually displayed without other sample-level molecular or clinical annotations. To address these gaps in the existing webtools, we have developed Evergene using R and Shiny. Evergene is a user-friendly webtool that utilizes RNA-sequencing data, alongside other sample and clinical annotation, for large-scale gene-centric analysis, including principal component analysis (PCA), survival analysis (SA), and correlation analysis (CA). Moreover, Evergene achieves in-depth analysis of cancer transcriptomic data which can be explored through dimensional reduction methods, relating gene expression with clinical events or other sample information, such as ethnicity, histological classification, and molecular indices. Lastly, users can upload custom data to Evergene for analysis. Evergene webtool is available at https://bshihlab.shinyapps.io/evergene/.

          "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is a malignant digestive tract tumor with a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. Fucosylation is important in tumor glycosylation, in which the key enzyme is fucosyltransferase (FUT). FUT11 is a member of the fucosyltransferase family and has been closely associated with the development of multiple cancers. However, the specific relationship between FUT11 and GC prognosis and its molecular mechanism has not been fully studied. This study explored FUT11 expression, clinical correlation, and its role in GC occurrence and development to deepen understanding of its function. FUT11 expression in 33 cancers was preliminarily analyzed using the Tumor Immunoassay Resource (TIMER2.0) database. FUT11 expression in GC was evaluated using The Cancer Genome Atlas stomach adenocarcinoma (TCGA-STAD) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA2) data and verified using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) GSE65801 dataset. Furthermore, we studied the survival prognosis of FUT11 in GC and analyzed its effect on the survival rate of patients with GC using the KM-plotter. We also performed COX regression analysis on TCGA GC clinical data and analyzed FUT11 expression in the pathway using the STRING and LinkedOmics databases. Moreover, the relationship between FUT11 and GC immune infiltration level was examined, and the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis diagram was constructed. The FUT11 genetic variation information was retrieved using cBioPortal, and its drug sensitivity was analyzed using CellMiner. Finally, differential FUT11 expression in GC tissues was verified using immunohistochemistry. The data mining and analysis demonstrated that FUT11 expression was abnormally elevated in GC tissues and correlated with poor patient prognosis. The FUT11 expression level was an independent prognostic factor for GC. The difference in FUT11 expression level resulted in different degrees of immune cell infiltration in the patients with GC, which might regulate the tumor microenvironment. FUT11 affected GC development by participating in cancer pathways such as PI3K-AKT, neuroactive ligand-receptor, and MAPK. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that FUT11 was highly expressed in GC. This study revealed that FUT11 expression is significantly increased in GC tissues. This increase is associated with poor prognosis and might affect immune regulation. FUT11 might have immunological and targeted therapeutic value, providing a new approach to GC treatment.",

They are also recurrent (along with <i>IDH1</i> mutations) in gliomas, acute myeloid leukemia, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Commonly reported mutations, all associated with aberrant IDH2 enzymatic activity, include R172K, R172S, R172T, R172G, and R172M. We present a case of SNUC with a never-before-described <i>IDH2</i> mutation, R172A. Our report compares the methylation pattern of our sample to other cases from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Hierarchical clustering suggests a strong association between our sample and other IDH-mutant SNUCs and a clear distinction between sinonasal normal tissues and tumors. Principal component analysis (PCA), using 100 principal components explaining 94.5% of the variance, showed the position of our sample to be within 1.02 standard deviation of the other IDH-mutant SNUCs. A molecular modeling analysis of the <i>IDH2</i> R172A versus other R172 variants provides a structural explanation to how they affect the protein active site. Our findings thus suggest that the R172A mutation in <i>IDH2</i> confers a gain of function similar to other R172 mutations in <i>IDH2</i>, resulting in a similar hypermethylated profile.",

We conducted a retrospective cohort study to address the association of serum bone turnover markers with oncologic outcomes. We included 80 women with BC, who were operated on at the Department of Gynecology, Obstetrics and Reproductive Medicine, Homburg/Saar, Germany. Serum samples were obtained prior to surgery and were used for estimation of the concentration of tumor and bone turnover markers using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and radioimmunoassay (RIA). At baseline, pyridinoline cross-linked carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type-1 collagen (ICTP) concentrations were higher in nodal positive vs. negative tumors (Mann-Whitney test <i>p</i> = 0.04). After a median follow-up of 79.4 months, 17 patients developed metastases, with 9 demonstrating, among other organs, osseous metastases. ICTP demonstrated the best area under the curve in the predection of osseous metastases in our cohort (AUC = 0.740, DeLong Test <i>p</i> = 0.005). Univariable Cox proportional hazard models failed to demonstrate significant associations between serum bone turnover markers and oncologic outcomes (progression-free survival, overall survival). Serum bone turnover markers (e.g., ICTP) were able to predict the development of osseous metastases but were not associated with oncologic outcomes. Further investigation and validation are required for the use of such markers in clinical practice.",

Using this model, we investigated the morphologic and signaling consequences of the KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> mutation, a commonly identified oncogene in human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We show that expression of the mutant KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> isoform in iAT2s leads to a hyperproliferative response and morphologic dysregulation in the epithelial monolayer. Interestingly, the mutant epithelia also drive an angiogenic response in the adjacent vasculature that is mediated by enhanced secretion of the pro-angiogenic factor soluble uPAR.

We report a method for simultaneously measuring non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR), and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). Using this method, we show that patient-derived glioblastoma (GBM) samples with acquired temozolomide (TMZ) resistance display elevated HR and MMEJ activity, suggesting that these pathways contribute to treatment resistance. We screen clinically relevant small molecules for DSBR inhibition with the aim of identifying improved GBM combination therapy regimens. We identify the ATM kinase inhibitor, AZD1390, as a potent dual HR/MMEJ inhibitor that suppresses radiation-induced\u00a0phosphorylation of DSBR proteins, blocks DSB end resection, and enhances the cytotoxic effects of TMZ in treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-resistant GBMs with TP53 mutation. We further show that a combination of G2/M checkpoint deficiency and reliance upon ATM-dependent DSBR renders TP53 mutant GBMs hypersensitive to TMZ/AZD1390 and radiation/AZD1390 combinations.

Here, we find that PTPRK regulates cell adhesion signalling, suppresses invasion and promotes collective, directed migration in colorectal cancer cells. In vivo, PTPRK supports recovery from inflammation-induced colitis. In addition, we confirm that PTPRK functions as a tumour suppressor in the mouse colon and in colorectal cancer xenografts. PTPRK regulates growth factor and adhesion signalling, and suppresses epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Contrary to the prevailing notion that PTPRK directly dephosphorylates EGFR, we find that PTPRK regulation of both EGFR and EMT is independent of its catalytic function.

Signals downstream of prolactin receptor (PRLR) could synergize with ER\u03b1 in breast cancer progression. However, the potential effect of targeting PRL-PRLR axis combined with tamoxifen has not been thoroughly investigated. High-throughput RNA-seq data obtained from TCGA, Metabric and GEO datasets were analyzed to explore PRLR expression in breast cancer cell and the association of PRLR expression with tamoxifen treatment. Exogenous or PRL overexpression cell models were employed to investigate the role of activated PRLR pathway in mediating tamoxifen insensitivity. Immunotoxin targeting PRLR (N8-PE24) was constructed with splicing-intein technique, and the efficacy of N8-PE24 against breast cancer was evaluated using in vitro and in vivo methods, including analysis of cells growth or apoptosis, 3D spheroids culture, and animal xenografts. PRLR pathway activated by PRL could significantly decrease sensitivity of ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer cells to tamoxifen. Tamoxifen treatment upregulated transcription of PRLR and could induce significant accumulation of PRLR protein in breast cancer cells by alkalizing lysosomes. Meanwhile, tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 achieved by long-term tamoxifen pressure exhibited both upregulated transcription and protein level of PRLR. Immunotoxin N8-PE24 enhanced sensitivity of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen both in vitro and in vivo. In xenograft models, N8-PE24 significantly enhanced the efficacy of tamoxifen and paclitaxel when treating PRLR-positive triple-negative breast cancer. PRL-PRLR axis potentially associates with tamoxifen insensitivity in ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer cells. N8-PE24 could inhibit cell growth of the breast cancers and promote drug sensitivity of PRLR-positive breast cancer cells to tamoxifen and paclitaxel. Our study provides a new perspective for targeting PRLR to treat breast cancer.",

Systematic exploration of transcriptional responses to paclitaxel and cancer-associated microenvironmental factors revealed common gene programs induced by paclitaxel, IFNB, and IFNG. Transcription factor (TF) enrichment analysis identified 13 TFs that were both enriched based on activity of downstream targets and also significantly upregulated after paclitaxel treatment. Functional assessment with siRNA knockdown confirmed that the TFs FOSL1, NFE2L2 and ELF3 mediate cellular proliferation and also regulate nuclear structure. We further explored the influence of these TFs on paclitaxel-induced cell cycle behavior via live cell imaging, which revealed altered progression rates through G1, S/G2 and M phases. We found that ELF3 knockdown synergized with paclitaxel treatment to lock cells in a G1 state and prevent cell cycle progression. Analysis of publicly available breast cancer patient data showed that high ELF3 expression was associated with poor prognosis and enrichment programs associated with cell cycle progression. Together these analyses disentangle the diverse aspects of paclitaxel response and identify ELF3 upregulation as a putative biomarker of paclitaxel resistance in TNBC.",

We examined the relationship between cell line genomic alterations and therapeutic response. In addition, using DepMap's Celligner tool, we identified which preclinical models are most representative of specific prostate cancer patient populations on cBioPortal.

          "abstract": "Obesity is a modifiable predisposition factor for postmenopausal breast cancer. This suggests a localized, reciprocal interaction between breast cancer cells and the surrounding mammary white adipose tissue. To investigate how breast cancer cells alter the composition and function of adipose tissue, we screened the secretomes of 10 human breast cancer cell lines for the ability to modulate the differentiation of adipocyte stem and progenitor cells. The screen identified an adipogenic modulator, zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein (ZAG/AZGP1) that is secreted by triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. TNBC-secreted ZAG inhibits adipogenesis and instead induces the expression of fibrotic genes. Accordingly, depletion of ZAG in TNBC cells attenuates fibrosis in white adipose tissue and inhibits tumor growth. Further, high expression of ZAG is linked to poor prognosis in patients with TNBC but not in patients with other clinical subtypes of breast cancer. Our findings suggest a role of TNBC-secreted ZAG in promoting the transdifferentiation of adipocyte stem and progenitor cells into cancer-associated fibroblasts to support tumorigenesis. Functional screening of breast cancer secretomes revealed that triple-negative breast cancer promotes fibrosis in the adipose tissue microenvironment by secreting zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein and promoting the transdifferentiation of adipocyte stem cells into myofibroblasts.",

Here we present transcriptional profiling of HER2+ breast cancer cells transitioning from dormant drug tolerant cells to re-proliferating cells under continuous HER2 inhibitor (HER2i) therapy. Focusing on phosphatases, expression of dual-specificity phosphatase DUSP6 was found inhibited in dormant cells, but strongly induced upon regrowth. DUSP6 expression also selectively associated with poor patient survival in HER2+ breast cancers. DUSP6 overexpression conferred apoptosis resistance, whereas its pharmacological blockade prevented therapy tolerance development under HER2i therapy. DUSP6 targeting also synergized with clinically used HER2i combination therapies. Mechanistically DUSP6 is a positive regulator of HER3 expression, and its impact on HER2i tolerance was mediated by neuregulin-HER3 axis. In vivo, genetic targeting of DUSP6 reduced tumor growth in brain metastasis model, whereas its pharmacological targeting induced synthetic lethal therapeutic effect in combination with HER2i. Collectively this work demonstrates that DUSP6 drives escape from HER2i-induced dormancy, and that DUSP6 is a druggable target to overcome HER3-driven TKI resistance.",

          "abstract": "The histone methyltransferase ASH1L, first discovered for its role in transcription, has been shown to accelerate the removal of ultraviolet (UV) light-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) by nucleotide excision repair. Previous reports demonstrated that CPD excision is most efficient at transcriptional regulatory elements, including enhancers, relative to other genomic sites. Therefore, we analyzed DNA damage maps in ASH1L-proficient and ASH1L-deficient cells to understand how ASH1L controls enhancer stability. This comparison showed that ASH1L protects enhancer sequences against the induction of CPDs besides stimulating repair activity. ASH1L reduces CPD formation at C-containing but not at TT dinucleotides, and no protection occurs against pyrimidine-(6,4)-pyrimidone photoproducts or cisplatin crosslinks. The diminished CPD induction extends to gene promoters but excludes retrotransposons. This guardian role against CPDs in regulatory elements is associated with the presence of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone marks, which are known to interact with the PHD and BRD motifs of ASH1L, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations identified a DNA-binding AT hook of ASH1L that alters the distance and dihedral angle between neighboring C nucleotides to disfavor dimerization. The loss of this protection results in a higher frequency of C->T transitions at enhancers of skin cancers carrying ASH1L mutations compared to ASH1L-intact counterparts.",

We explored the patterns and biological functions of CHRGs in AML. Using independent cohorts, including TCGA-GTEx, GSE114868, GSE37642, and clinical samples, we identified 826 common differentially expressed genes. Specifically, 12 cuproptosis-related genes (e.g., ATP7A, ATP7B) were upregulated, while 17 cuproplasia-associated genes (e.g., ATOX1, ATP7A) were downregulated in AML. We used LASSO-Cox, Kaplan-Meier, and Nomogram analyses to establish prognostic risk models, effectively stratifying patients with AML into high- and low-risk groups. Subgroup analysis revealed that high-risk patients exhibited poorer overall survival and involvement in fatty acid metabolism, apoptosis, and glycolysis. Immune infiltration analysis indicated differences in immune cell composition, with notable increases in B cells, cytotoxic T cells, and memory T cells in the low-risk group, and increased monocytes and neutrophils in the high-risk group. Single-cell sequencing analysis corroborated the expression characteristics of critical CHRGs, such as MAPK1 and ATOX1, associated with the function of T, B, and NK cells. Drug sensitivity analysis suggested potential therapeutic agents targeting copper homeostasis, including Bicalutamide and Sorafenib. PCR validation confirmed the differential expression of 4 cuproptosis-related genes (LIPT1, SLC31A1, GCSH, and PDHA1) and 9 cuproplasia-associated genes (ATOX1, CCS, CP, MAPK1, SOD1, COA6, PDK1, DBH, and PDE3B) in AML cell line. Importantly, these genes serve as potential biomarkers for patient stratification and treatment. In conclusion, we shed light on the expression patterns and biological functions of CHRGs in AML. The developed risk models provided prognostic implications for patient survival, offering valuable information on the regulatory characteristics of CHRGs and potential avenues for personalized treatment in AML.",

Glutamine metabolism is frequently dysregulated in cancers and is being exploited as a potential therapeutic target. Using CRISPR/Cas9 interference (CRISPRi) screening, we identified TARBP1 (TAR (HIV-1) RNA Binding Protein 1) as a critical regulator involved in glutamine reliance of cancer cell. Consistent with this discovery, TARBP1 amplification and overexpression are frequently observed in various cancers. Knockout of TARBP1 significantly suppresses cell proliferation, colony formation and xenograft tumor growth. Mechanistically, TARBP1 selectively methylates and stabilizes a small subset of tRNAs, which promotes efficient protein synthesis of glutamine transporter-ASCT2 (also known as SLC1A5) and glutamine import to fuel the growth of cancer cell. Moreover, we found that the gene expression of TARBP1 and ASCT2 are upregulated in combination in clinical cohorts and their upregulation is associated with unfavorable prognosis of HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma). Taken together, this study reveals the unexpected role of TARBP1 in coordinating the tRNA availability and glutamine uptake during HCC progression and provides a potential target for tumor therapy.",

A targeted tumour sequencing test enables comprehensive assessment of alterations in cancer-related genes, including ERBB2. This study aimed to evaluate the concordance between the targeted tumour sequencing test and IHC/FISH for detecting HER2-positive GC and to clarify the significance of ERBB2 AMP and concomitant genetic alterations in HER2 downstream pathways (DPs) in anti-HER2 therapy for unresectable metastatic GC patients. ERBB2 copy number alteration (CNA) was examined via a targeted tumour sequencing test in 152 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) GC tissues. ERBB2 CNA was compared to HER2 status evaluated by IHC/FISH in FFPE block sections, which were identical to those subjected to the targeted tumour sequencing test. Treatment outcomes of anti-HER2 therapy in 11 patients with unresectable metastatic GC was evaluated. ERBB2 AMP (\u2265\u20092.5-fold change) was detected by the targeted tumour sequencing test in 15 patients (9.9%), and HER2 positivity (IHC 3\u2009+\u2009or IHC 2+/FISH positive) was detected in 21 patients (13.8%). The overall percent agreement, positive percent agreement, negative percent agreement and Cohen's kappa between ERBB2 CNA and HER2 status were 94.7%, 66.7%, 99.2% and 0.75, respectively. Progression-free survival for trastuzumab therapy in patients with ERBB2 AMP was significantly longer than that in patients with no ERBB2 AMP detected by the targeted tumour sequencing test (median 14 months vs. 4 months, P\u2009=\u20090.007). Treatment response to trastuzumab therapy was reduced in patients with ERBB2 AMP and concomitant CNAs of genes in HER2 DPs. One patient with ERBB2 AMP and concomitant CNAs of genes in HER2 DPs achieved a durable response to trastuzumab deruxtecan as fourth-line therapy. A targeted tumour sequencing test is a reliable modality for identifying HER2-positive GC. ERBB2 AMP and concomitant genetic alterations detected through the targeted tumour sequencing test are potential indicators of treatment response to trastuzumab therapy. The targeted tumour sequencing test has emerged as a plausible candidate for companion diagnostics to determine indications for anti-HER2 therapy in the era of precision medicine for GC.",

The aim of this study was to uncover the distinctive transcriptomic characteristics and monitoring prognosis potential of peritumoral tissue in early-stage cases. RNA was isolated from tumoral, peritumoral, and non-tumoral breast tissue from surgical resection of 10 luminal early-stage invasive ductal carcinoma patients. Transcriptome expression profiling for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identification was carried out through microarray analysis. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathways enrichment analysis were explored for functional characterization of identified DEGs. Protein-Protein Interactions (PPI) networks analysis was performed to identify hub nodes of peritumoral tissue alterations and correlated with Overall Survival and Relapse Free Survival. DEGs closely related with cell migration, extracellular matrix organization, and cell cycle were upregulated in peritumoral tissue compared to non-tumoral. Analyzing PPI networks, we observed that the proximity to tumor leads to the alteration of gene modules involved in cell proliferation and differentiation signaling pathways. In fact, in the peritumoral area were identified the top ten upregulated hub nodes including CDK1, ESR1, NOP58, PCNA, EZH2, PPP1CA, BUB1, TGFBR1, CXCR4, and CCND1. A signature performed by four of these hub nodes (CDK1, PCNA, EZH2, and BUB1) was associated with relapse events in untreated luminal breast cancer patients. In conclusion, our study characterizes in depth breast peritumoral tissue providing clues on the changes that tumor signaling could cause in patients with early-stage breast cancer. We propose that the use of a four gene signature could help to predict local relapse. Overall, our results highlight the value of peritumoral tissue as a potential source of new biomarkers for early detection of relapse and improvement in invasive ductal carcinoma patient's prognosis.",

Importantly, the ongoing molecular characterisation of GCs continues to uncover potentially actionable molecular targets. Among these, aberrant FGFR2-driven signalling, predominantly arising from <i>FGFR2</i> amplification, occurs in approximately 3-11% of GCs. However, whilst several inhibitors of FGFR have been clinically tested to-date, there are currently no approved FGFR-directed therapies for GC. In this review, we summarise the significance of FGFR2 as an actionable therapeutic target in GC, examine the recent pre-clinical and clinical data supporting the use of small-molecule inhibitors, antibody-based therapies, as well as novel approaches such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) for targeting FGFR2 in these tumours, and discuss the ongoing challenges and opportunities associated with their clinical development.",

To this end, we combined the activated form of the PI 3-kinase harboring the H1047R mutation with the inactivation of the histone lysine methyl-transferase KMT2D in the non-tumorigenic human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A. We found that PI 3-kinase activation promoted cell-cycle progression, especially when growth signals were limiting, as well as cell migration, both in a collective monolayer and as single cells. Furthermore, we showed that KMT2D inactivation had relatively little influence on these processes, except for single-cell migration, which KMT2D inactivation promoted in synergy with PI 3-kinase activation. The combination of these two genetic alterations induced expression of the <i>ARPC5L</i> gene that encodes a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex. ARPC5L depletion fully abolished the enhanced migration persistence exhibited by double-mutant cells. Our reconstitution approach in MCF10A has thus revealed both the cell function and the single-cell migration, and the underlying Arp2/3-dependent mechanism, which are synergistically regulated when KMT2D inactivation is combined with the activation of the PI 3-kinase.",

Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were investigated in a cohort of 616 female patients using NGS and/or MLPA methods followed by software-based data analysis and classification according to international guidelines. Out of the 616 female patients included in this study, we found that 482 patients (78.2%) did not have any mutation present in the two genes investigated; 69 patients (11.2%) had a <i>BRCA1</i> mutation, 34 (5.5%) had a <i>BRCA2</i> mutation, and 31 (5%) presented different type of mutations with uncertain clinical significance, moderate risk or a large mutation in the <i>BRCA1</i> gene. Our investigation indicates the most common mutations in the <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> genes, associated with breast and ovarian cancer in the Romanian population. Our results also bring more data in support of the frequency of the c.5266 mutation in the BRCA1 gene, acknowledged in the literature as a founder mutation in Eastern Europe. We consider that the results of our study will provide necessary data regarding <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> mutations that would help to create a genetic database for the Romanian population.",

          "abstract": "ATP-binding cassette transporters represent a superfamily of dynamic membrane-based proteins with diverse yet common functions such as use of ATP hydrolysis to efflux substrates across cellular membranes. Three major transporters-P-glycoprotein (P-gp or ABCB1), multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1 or ABCC1), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP or ABCG2) are notoriously involved in therapy resistance in cancer patients. Despite exhaustive individual characterizations of each of these transporters, there is a lack of understanding in terms of the functional role of mutations in substrate binding and efflux, leading to drug resistance. We analyzed clinical variations reported in endometrial cancers for these transporters. For ABCB1, the majority of key mutations were present in the membrane-facing region, followed by the drug transport channel and ATP-binding regions. Similarly, for ABCG2, the majority of key mutations were located in the membrane-facing region, followed by the ATP-binding region and drug transport channel, thus highlighting the importance of membrane-mediated drug recruitment and efflux in ABCB1 and ABCG2. On the other hand, for ABCC1, the majority of key mutations were present in the inactive nucleotide-binding domain, followed by the drug transport channel and membrane-facing regions, highlighting the importance of the inactive nucleotide-binding domain in facilitating indirect drug efflux in ABCC1. The identified key mutations in endometrial cancer and mapped common mutations present across different types of cancers in ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2 will facilitate the design and discovery of inhibitors targeting unexplored structural regions of these transporters and re-engineering of these transporters to tackle chemoresistance.",

Previous research has aimed at exploring the genetic basis of NSCLC through individual approaches, but studies have yet to investigate the results of combining them. Here we show that analyzing NSCLC genetics through three approaches simultaneously creates unique insights into our understanding of the disease. Through a combination of previous research and bioinformatics tools, we determined 35 NSCLC candidate genes. We analyzed these genes in 3 different approaches. First, we found the gene fusions between these candidate genes. Second, we found the common superfamilies between genes. Finally, we identified mutational signatures that are possibly associated with NSCLC. Each approach has its individual, unique results. Fusion relationships identify specific gene fusion targets, common superfamilies identify possible avenues to determine novel target genes, and identifying NSCLC associated mutational signatures has diagnostic and prognostic benefits. Combining the approaches, we found that gene CD74 has significant fusion relationships, but it has no association with the other two approaches, suggesting that CD74 is associated with NSCLC mainly because of its fusion relationships. Targeting the gene fusions of CD74 may be an alternative NSCLC treatment. This genetic analysis has indeed created unique insight into NSCLC genes. Both the results from each of the approaches separately and combined allow pursuit of more effective treatment strategies for this cancer. The methodology presented can also apply to other cancers, creating insights that current analytical methods could not find.",

Mounting evidence suggests that PKC\u03b8 may be involved in cancer, particularly blood cancers, breast cancer, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, yet how to target this kinase (as an oncogene or as a tumor suppressor) has not been established. Here, we examine the effect of four cancer-associated mutations, R145H/C in the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate, E161K in the regulatory C1A domain, and R635W in the regulatory C-terminal tail, on the cellular activity and stability of PKC\u03b8. Live-cell imaging studies using the genetically-encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based reporter for PKC activity, C kinase activity reporter 2 (CKAR2), revealed that the pseudosubstrate and C1A domain mutations impaired autoinhibition to increase basal signaling. This impaired autoinhibition resulted in decreased stability of the protein, consistent with the well-characterized behavior of Ca2+-regulated PKC isozymes wherein mutations that impair autoinhibition are paradoxically loss-of-function because the mutant protein is degraded. In marked contrast, the C-terminal tail mutation resulted in enhanced autoinhibition and enhanced stability. Thus, the examined mutations were loss-of-function by different mechanisms: mutations that impaired autoinhibition promoted the degradation of PKC, and those that enhanced autoinhibition stabilized an inactive PKC. Supporting a general loss-of-function of PKC\u03b8 in cancer, bioinformatics analysis revealed that protein levels of PKC\u03b8 are reduced in diverse cancers, including lung, renal, head and neck, and pancreatic. Our results reveal that PKC\u03b8 function is lost in cancer.",

The prevalence of ARID1A alterations in gynecologic precancers and cancers is summarized from the literature, and the putative mechanisms of tumor suppressive action examined both in benign/precursor lesions including endometriosis and atypical hyperplasia and in malignancies of the ovary, uterus, cervix and vagina. ARID1A alterations in gynecologic cancers are usually loss-of-function mutations, resulting in diminished or absent protein expression. ARID1A deficiency results in pleiotropic downstream effects related not only to its role in transcriptional regulation as a SWI/SNF complex subunit, but also related to the functions of ARID1A in DNA replication and repair, immune modulation, cell cycle progression, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress. The most promising actionable signaling pathway interactions and therapeutic vulnerabilities of ARID1A mutated cancers are presented with a critical review of the currently available experimental and clinical evidence. The role of ARID1A in response to chemotherapeutic agents, radiation therapy and immunotherapy is also addressed. In summary, the multi-faceted role of ARID1A mutation in precancer and cancer is examined through a clinical lens focused on development of novel preventive and therapeutic interventions for gynecological cancers.",

          "abstract": "The immune microenvironment impacts tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and patient survival and may provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Although never studied as a potential modulator of the immune response in most cancers, Keratin 17 (K17), a biomarker of the most aggressive (basal) molecular subtype of PDAC, is intimately involved in the histogenesis of the immune response in psoriasis, basal cell carcinoma, and cervical squamous cell carcinoma. Thus, we hypothesized that K17 expression could also impact the immune cell response in PDAC, and that uncovering this relationship could provide insight to guide the development of immunotherapeutic opportunities to extend patient survival. Multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) and automated image analysis based on novel computational imaging technology were used to decipher the abundance and spatial distribution of T cells, macrophages, and tumor cells, relative to K17 expression in 235 PDACs. K17 expression had profound effects on the exclusion of intratumoral CD8+ T cells and was also associated with decreased numbers of peritumoral CD8+ T cells, CD16+ macrophages, and CD163+ macrophages (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The differences in the intratumor and peritumoral CD8+ T cell abundance were not impacted by neoadjuvant therapy, tumor stage, grade, lymph node status, histologic subtype, nor KRAS, p53, SMAD4, or CDKN2A mutations. Thus, K17 expression correlates with major differences in the immune microenvironment that are independent of any tested clinicopathologic or tumor intrinsic variables, suggesting that targeting K17-mediated immune effects on the immune system could restore the innate immunologic response to PDAC and might provide novel opportunities to restore immunotherapeutic approaches for this most deadly form of cancer.",

We have previously demonstrated that the PI3K pathway regulates ER activity through phosphorylation of the chromatin modifier KMT2D. Here, we discovered a methylation site on KMT2D, at K1330 directly adjacent to S1331, catalyzed by the lysine methyltransferase SMYD2. SMYD2 loss attenuates alpelisib-induced KMT2D chromatin binding and alpelisib-mediated changes in gene expression, including ER-dependent transcription. Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of SMYD2 sensitizes breast cancer cells, patient-derived organoids, and tumors to PI3K/AKT inhibition and endocrine therapy in part through KMT2D K1330 methylation. Together, our findings uncover a regulatory crosstalk between post-translational modifications that fine-tunes KMT2D function at the chromatin. This provides a rationale for the use of SMYD2 inhibitors in combination with PI3K\u03b1/AKT inhibitors in the treatment of ER+/PIK3CA mutant breast cancer.",

Here, we identified a chromosome 3q amplicon that serves as a platform for secretory regulation in cancer. The 3q amplicon encodes multiple Golgi-resident proteins, including the scaffold Golgi integral membrane protein 4 (GOLIM4) and the ion channel ATPase secretory pathway Ca2+ transporting 1 (ATP2C1). We show that GOLIM4 recruited ATP2C1 and Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) to coordinate Ca2+-dependent cargo loading, Golgi membrane bending, and vesicle scission. GOLIM4 depletion disrupted the protein complex, resulting in a secretory blockade that inhibited the progression of 3q-amplified malignancies. In addition to its role as a scaffold, GOLIM4 maintained intracellular manganese (Mn) homeostasis by binding excess Mn in the Golgi lumen, which initiated the routing of Mn-bound GOLIM4 to lysosomes for degradation. We show that Mn treatment inhibited the progression of multiple types of 3q-amplified malignancies by degrading GOLIM4, resulting in a secretory blockade that interrupted prosurvival autocrine loops and attenuated prometastatic processes in the tumor microenvironment. As it potentially underlies the selective activity of Mn against 3q-amplified malignancies, ATP2C1 coamplification increased Mn influx into the Golgi lumen, resulting in a more rapid degradation of GOLIM4. These findings show that functional cooperativity between coamplified genes underlies heightened secretion and a targetable secretory addiction in 3q-amplified malignancies.",

Further, its overexpression is associated with the aggressiveness of several types of solid cancers. This study investigated COMP's role in ovarian cancer, exploring clinicopathological links and mechanistic insights. To study the association of COMP expression in cancer cells and stroma with clinicopathological features of ovarian tumor patients, we analyzed an epithelial ovarian tumor cohort by immunohistochemical analysis. Subsequently, to study the functional mechanisms played by COMP, an in vivo xenograft mouse model and several molecular biology techniques such as transwell migration and invasion assay, tumorsphere formation assay, proximity ligation assay, and RT-qPCR array were performed. Based on immunohistochemical analysis of epithelial ovarian tumor tissues, COMP expression in the stroma, but not in cancer cells, was linked to worse overall survival (OS) of ovarian cancer patients. A xenograft mouse model showed that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) expressing COMP stimulate the growth and metastasis of ovarian tumors through the secretion of COMP. The expression of COMP was upregulated in CAFs stimulated with TGF-\u03b2. Functionally, secreted COMP by CAFs enhanced the migratory capacity of ovarian cancer cells. Mechanistically, COMP activated the Notch3 receptor by enhancing the Notch3-Jagged1 interaction. The dependency of the COMP effect on Notch was confirmed when the migration and tumorsphere formation of COMP-treated ovarian cancer cells were inhibited upon incubation with Notch inhibitors. Moreover, COMP treatment induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and upregulation of active \u03b2-catenin in ovarian cancer cells. This study suggests that COMP secretion by CAFs drives ovarian cancer progression through the induction of the Notch pathway and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.",

          "abstract": "Bariatric surgery is associated with improved outcomes for several cancers, including breast cancer (BC), although the mechanisms mediating this protection are unknown. We hypothesized that elevated bile acid pools detected after bariatric surgery may be factors that contribute to improved BC outcomes. Patients with greater expression of the bile acid receptor FXR displayed improved survival in specific aggressive BC subtypes. FXR is a nuclear hormone receptor activated by primary bile acids. Therefore, we posited that activating FXR using an established FDA-approved agonist would induce anticancer effects. Using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we determined the anti-tumor potential of bile acid receptor agonism. Indeed, FXR agonism by the bile acid mimetic known commercially as Ocaliva (\"OCA\"), or Obeticholic acid (INT-747), significantly reduced BC progression and overall tumor burden in a pre-clinical model. The transcriptomic analysis of tumors in mice subjected to OCA treatment revealed differential gene expression patterns compared to vehicle controls. Notably, there was a significant down-regulation of the oncogenic transcription factor MAX (MYC-associated factor X), which interacts with the oncogene MYC. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) further demonstrated a statistically significant downregulation of the Hallmark MYC-related gene set (MYC Target V1) following OCA treatment. In human and murine BC analyses in vitro, agonism of FXR significantly and dose-dependently inhibited proliferation, migration, and viability. In contrast, the synthetic agonism of another common bile acid receptor, the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor TGR5 (GPBAR1) which is mainly activated by secondary bile acids, failed to significantly alter cancer cell dynamics. In conclusion, agonism of FXR by primary bile acid memetic OCA yields potent anti-tumor effects potentially through inhibition of proliferation and migration and reduced cell viability. These findings suggest that FXR is a tumor suppressor gene with a high potential for use in personalized therapeutic strategies for individuals with BC.",

This retrospective study analyzed data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and included PC patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) and had pathology slides available for the assessment of CP4. A multivariable competing risk regression analysis was used to assess the association between CP4 and progression-free survival (PFS) while adjusting for established PC prognostic factors. The frequency of genomic alterations was compared between patients with and without CP4 using the Fisher's exact test. Among the 394 patients analyzed, 129 (32.74%) had CP4. After a median follow-up of 40.50 months (IQR: 23.90, 65.60), the presence of CP4 was significantly associated with lower PFS (AHR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.08 to 3.114; <i>p</i> = 0.023) after adjusting for covariates. Seven hub genes-KRT13, KRT5, KRT15, COL17A1, KRT14, KRT16, and TP63-had significantly lower mRNA expression levels in patients with CP4 compared to those without. PC patients with CP4 have distinct genomic alterations and are at a high risk of disease progression following RP. Therefore, these patients may benefit from additional post-RP treatments and should be the subject of a prospective randomized clinical trial.",

          "abstract": "Genetic alterations are well characterized as contributors to the pathogenesis of cancers. Epigenetic abnormalities can lead to perturbations of the expression of genes in cancer cells without structural defects. Deregulation of proteins of the transcription machinery may result in perturbations of target genes. Mediator, a multiprotein component of the transcription machinery facilitates the function of RNA polymerase II, which transcribes most human genes. A part of the mediator with kinase activity, called the Mediator kinase module shows genetic alterations in a sub-set of colorectal cancers. Data from publicly available genomic series of colorectal cancer patients were examined to determine alterations of Mediator kinase module component genes, including MED12, MED12L, MED13, MED13L, CDK8, CDK19, and CCNC. The prevalence of alterations in genomically defined colorectal cancer sub-sets was also interrogated. The effect of Mediator kinase module member gene expression on colorectal cancer relapse-free survival was investigated. Mutations in genes of the Mediator kinase module were present in a small percentage of colorectal cancers, ranging between 2 to 10% for MED12 and MED13 and alternative units MED12L and MED13L and below 2% for kinases CDK8 and CDK19 and cyclin C. Amplifications of the CDK8 gene were observed in 3% to 5% of colorectal cancers. The highest prevalence of mutations was observed in MSI cancers and the equivalent CMS1 group, with other genomic groups showing much lower frequency. An association of higher expression of MED12 with inferior relapse-free survival was observed. In contrast, higher expression of cyclin C was associated with improved survival. Colorectal cancer cell lines with CDK8 amplifications displayed sensitivity to several small molecule inhibitors of the KRAS/PI3K pathway but not to BET inhibitors. The Mediator kinase module is deregulated in a sub-set of colorectal cancers with differences observed in genomically defined groups. These variations may result in differences in sensitivity to targeted therapies and may have to be taken into consideration as such therapies are developed.",

Despite therapeutic progress, understanding molecular intricacies is essential. This study explored the role of PON2, a multifunctional enzyme implicated in antiapoptotic mechanisms. Aberrant PON2 expression in oral cancers raises questions regarding its involvement in evading programmed cell death and treatment resistance. Patients with locally advanced disease were enrolled, and molecular analyses were undertaken on the collected tumor and normal tissues. Utilizing computational datasets, this study used in silico gene expression analysis, differential gene expression analysis in our patient cohort, survival analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis to unravel role of PON2 in disease prognosis. The results showed elevated PON2 levels in advanced tumor stages, correlating with factors such as tobacco exposure, higher tumor grade, and nodal metastasis. Survival analysis revealed prognostic relevance of PON2, with lower expression linked to extended survival rates. Gene set enrichment analysis identified pathways aiding in cancer metastasis influenced by PON2. This study underscores the significance of PON2 expression as a prognostic marker for oral malignancies, with increased expression associated with advanced disease stages. Understanding the molecular profile of the PON2 gene suggests its potential as a valuable biomarker for the management of cancer.",

Here we report the activity of CHK1i in platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) with measurable and biopsiable disease (cohort 5), or without biopsiable disease (cohort 6). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary outcomes were safety and progression-free survival (PFS). 49 heavily pretreated patients were enrolled (24 in cohort 5, 25 in cohort 6). Among the 39 RECISTv1.1-evaluable patients, ORR was 33.3% in cohort 5 and 28.6% in cohort 6. Primary endpoint was not evaluable due to early stop of the trial. The median PFS was 4\u00a0months in cohort 5 and 6\u00a0months in cohort 6. Toxicity was manageable. Translational research was an exploratory endpoint. Potential biomarkers were investigated using pre-treatment fresh biopsies and serial blood samples. Transcriptomic analysis revealed high levels of DNA replication-related genes (POLA1, POLE, GINS3) associated with lack of clinical benefit [defined post-hoc as PFS <\u00a06 months]. Subsequent preclinical experiments demonstrated significant cytotoxicity of POLA1 silencing in combination with CHK1i in platinum-resistant HGSOC cell line models. Therefore, POLA1 expression may be predictive for CHK1i resistance, and the concurrent POLA1 inhibition may improve the efficacy of CHK1i monotherapy in this hard-to-treat population, deserving further investigation.",

Utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and biochemical techniques, we mapped the conformational changes induced by this mutation and investigated its role in CTLA-4 activity. Our findings reveal that this mutation leads to a distinct conformational alteration, enhancing protein-membrane interactions. Moreover, functional assays demonstrated an improved capacity of the G199R mutant to downregulate T-cell activation, underscoring its potential role in immune-related disorders.

Through applying systematic bioinformatic analysis, we determined that out of 31 chromatin remodeling factors in six gastrointestinal cancers, only PR/SET domain 1 (PRDM1) showed both expression alteration and prognosis prediction. Analyses on pathways, therapies, and mediators showed that cell cycle, bromodomain inhibitor IBET151, and BET protein BRD4 were, respectively involved in PRDM1-high stomach cancer, while cell line experiments validated that PRDM1 knockdown in human stomach cancer cell line SNU-1 decreased its proliferation, BRD4 expression, and responsiveness to IBET151; accordingly, these results indicate the contribution by PRDM1 in stomach cancer formation and its association with BRD4 modulation as well as BET inhibitor treatment.",

Tumor tissues showed decreased coagulation, hematopoiesis, and innate immune pathways, whereas complement- and coagulation-related genes were prominent in the tumor immune gene network. The average numbers of neighbors, clustering coefficients, network diameters, path lengths, densities, and heterogeneities were highest for normal tissue, followed by LUAD and LUSC. Decreased coagulation genes, which were prominent in tumor immune networks, imply functional attenuation. LUAD was deviated from normal tissue, based on network parameters.

Here we evaluated safety and tolerability of a therapeutic vaccine encoding 20 shared neoantigens derived from selected common oncogenic driver mutations as primary endpoints in an ongoing phase 1/2 study in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors. Secondary endpoints included immunogenicity, overall response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival. Eligible patients were selected if their tumors expressed one of the human leukocyte antigen-matched tumor mutations included in the vaccine, with the majority of patients (18/19) harboring a mutation in KRAS. The vaccine regimen, consisting of a chimp adenovirus (ChAd68) and self-amplifying mRNA (samRNA) in combination with the immune checkpoint inhibitors ipilimumab and nivolumab, was shown to be well tolerated, with observed treatment-related adverse events consistent with acute inflammation expected with viral vector-based vaccines and immune checkpoint blockade, the majority grade 1/2. Two patients experienced grade 3/4 serious treatment-related adverse events that were also dose-limiting toxicities. The overall response rate was 0%, and median progression-free survival and overall survival were 1.9\u2009months and 7.9\u2009months, respectively. T cell responses were biased toward human leukocyte antigen-matched TP53 neoantigens encoded in the vaccine relative to KRAS neoantigens expressed by the patients' tumors, indicating a previously unknown hierarchy of neoantigen immunodominance that may impact the therapeutic efficacy of multiepitope shared neoantigen vaccines. These data led to the development of an optimized vaccine exclusively targeting KRAS-derived neoantigens that is being evaluated in a subset of patients in phase 2 of the clinical study.

Despite the identification of distinct CAF subtypes using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), their functional impact on hindering T-cell infiltration remains unclear, particularly in soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) characterized by low response rates to T cell-based therapies. In this study, we characterize the STS microenvironment using murine models (in female mice) with distinct immune composition by scRNA-seq, and identify a subset of CAFs we termed glycolytic cancer-associated fibroblasts (glyCAF). GlyCAF rely on GLUT1-dependent expression of CXCL16 to impede cytotoxic T-cell infiltration into the tumor parenchyma. Targeting glycolysis decreases T-cell restrictive glyCAF accumulation at the tumor margin, thereby enhancing T-cell infiltration and augmenting the efficacy of chemotherapy. These findings highlight avenues for combinatorial therapeutic interventions in sarcomas and possibly other solid tumors. Further investigations and clinical trials are needed to validate these potential strategies and translate them into clinical practice.",

Previous study has identified that missense mutation or loss of the NER genes Excision Repair Cross Complementation Group 1 and 2 (<i>ERCC1</i> and <i>ERCC2</i>) leads to improved patient outcomes after treatment with Pt-based chemotherapies. Although most NER gene alterations found in patient tumors are missense mutations, the impact of mutations in the remaining nearly 20 NER genes is unknown. Towards this goal, we previously developed a machine learning strategy to predict genetic variants in an essential NER protein, Xeroderma Pigmentosum Complementation Group A (XPA), that disrupt repair. In this study, we report in-depth analyses of a subset of the predicted variants, including <i>in vitro</i> analyses of purified recombinant protein and cell-based assays to test Pt agent sensitivity in cells and determine mechanisms of NER dysfunction. The most NER deficient variant Y148D had reduced protein stability, weaker DNA binding, disrupted recruitment to damage, and degradation. Our findings demonstrate that tumor mutations in XPA impact cell survival after cisplatin treatment and provide valuable mechanistic insights to improve variant effect prediction. Broadly, these findings suggest XPA tumor variants should be considered when predicting chemotherapy response.",

To investigate how breast cancer cells alter the composition and function of adipose tissue, we screened the secretomes of ten human breast cancer cell lines for the ability to modulate the differentiation of adipocyte stem and progenitor cells (ASPC). The screen identified a key adipogenic modulator, Zinc Alpha-2-Glycoprotein (ZAG/AZGP1), secreted by triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. TNBC-secreted ZAG inhibits adipogenesis and instead induces the expression of fibrotic genes. Accordingly, depletion of ZAG in TNBC cells attenuates fibrosis in white adipose tissue and inhibits tumor growth. Further, high expression of ZAG in TNBC patients, but not other clinical subtypes of breast cancer, is linked to poor prognosis. Our findings suggest a role of TNBC-secreted ZAG in promoting the transdifferentiation of ASPCs into cancer-associated fibroblasts to support tumorigenesis.",

          "abstract": "Complex and expanding data sets in clinical oncology applications require flexible and interactive visualization of patient data to provide the maximum amount of information to physicians and other medical practitioners. Interdisciplinary tumor conferences in particular profit from customized tools to integrate, link, and visualize relevant data from all professions involved. The scoping review proposed in this protocol aims to identify and present currently available data visualization tools for tumor boards and related areas. The objective of the review will be to provide not only an overview of digital tools currently used in tumor board settings, but also the data included, the respective visualization solutions, and their integration into hospital processes. The planned scoping review process is based on the Arksey and O'Malley scoping study framework. The following electronic databases will be searched for articles published in English: PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and SCOPUS. Eligible articles will first undergo a deduplication step, followed by the screening of titles and abstracts. Second, a full-text screening will be used to reach the final decision about article selection. At least 2 reviewers will independently screen titles, abstracts, and full-text reports. Conflicting inclusion decisions will be resolved by a third reviewer. The remaining literature will be analyzed using a data extraction template proposed in this protocol. The template includes a variety of meta information as well as specific questions aiming to answer the research question: \"What are the key features of data visualization solutions used in molecular and organ tumor boards, and how are these elements integrated and used within the clinical setting?\" The findings will be compiled, charted, and presented as specified in the scoping study framework. Data for included tools may be supplemented with additional manual literature searches. The entire review process will be documented in alignment with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) flowchart. The results of this scoping review will be reported per the expanded PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A preliminary search using PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and Scopus resulted in 1320 articles after deduplication that will be included in the further review process. We expect the results to be published during the second quarter of 2024. Visualization is a key process in leveraging a data set's potentially available information and enabling its use in an interdisciplinary setting. The scoping review described in this protocol aims to present the status quo of visualization solutions for tumor board and clinical oncology applications and their integration into hospital processes.

Refinement of ATM loss of function (LOF) as a predictive biomarker of response is urgently needed. We present the first disclosure and preclinical development of a novel, selective ATR inhibitor, ART0380, and test its antitumor activity in multiple preclinical cancer models. To refine ATM LOF as a predictive biomarker, we performed a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of ATM variants in patient tumors and then assessed the ATM variant-to-protein relationship. Finally, we assessed a novel ATM LOF biomarker approach in retrospective clinical data sets of patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy or ATR inhibition. ART0380 had potent, selective antitumor activity in a range of preclinical cancer models with differing degrees of ATM LOF. Pan-cancer analysis identified 10,609 ATM variants in 8,587 patient tumors. Cancer lineage-specific differences were seen in the prevalence of deleterious (Tier 1) versus unknown/benign (Tier 2) variants, selective pressure for loss of heterozygosity, and concordance between a deleterious variant and ATM loss of protein (LOP). A novel ATM LOF biomarker approach that accounts for variant classification, relationship to ATM LOP, and tissue-specific penetrance significantly enriched for patients who benefited from platinum-based chemotherapy or ATR inhibition. These data help to better define ATM LOF across tumor types in order to optimize patient selection and improve molecularly targeted therapeutic approaches for patients with ATM LOF cancers.",

Increasing evidence indicates that both the aberrant expression and oncogenic function of EREG play pivotal roles in tumor development in many human cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). EREG overexpression is induced by activating mutations in the <i>EGFR</i>, <i>KRAS</i>, and <i>BRAF</i> and contributes to the aggressive phenotypes of NSCLC with oncogenic drivers. Recent studies have elucidated the roles of EREG in a tumor microenvironment, including the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and resistance to anticancer therapy. In this review, we summarized the current understanding of EREG as an oncogene and discussed its oncogenic role in lung tumorigenesis and therapeutic resistance.",

Stromal status is significantly associated with the depth of tumor invasion. Patient survival rate was found to be higher in the SP compared to the SR tumor group and, hence, abundant stroma was identified as a significant risk factor in univariable analysis but had no independent prognostic impact. We also investigated the mRNA levels of KRT8 and the associated transcriptional signatures using the molecular data of 82 PCGC cases divided into KRT8-high and KRT8-low groups. KRT8-high tumors were enriched in proteins localized in the extracellular compartment and their expression levels correlated with longer survival in the KRT8-high group and shorter overall survival in the KRT8-low group. Comprehensively, we find that relative intralesional stromal content is a marker of aggressiveness in PCGC tumors and that extracellular proteins characterize functionally and clinically different PCGC subgroups.",

          "abstract": "Myelofibrosis (MF) is an essential element of primary myelofibrosis, whereas secondary MF may develop in the advanced stages of other myeloid neoplasms, especially polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. Over the last two decades, advances in molecular diagnostic techniques, particularly the integration of next-generation sequencing in clinical laboratories, have revolutionized the diagnosis, classification, and clinical decision making of myelofibrosis. Driver mutations involving <i>JAK2</i>, <i>CALR</i>, and <i>MPL</i> induce hyperactivity in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which plays a central role in cell survival and proliferation. Approximately 80% of myelofibrosis cases harbor additional mutations, frequently in the genes responsible for epigenetic regulation and RNA splicing. Detecting these mutations is crucial for diagnosing myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), especially in cases where no mutations are present in the three driver genes (triple-negative MPNs). While fibrosis in the bone marrow results from the disturbance of inflammatory cytokines, it is fundamentally associated with mutation-driven hematopoiesis. The mutation profile and order of acquiring diverse mutations influence the MPN phenotype. Mutation profiling reveals clonal diversity in MF, offering insights into the clonal evolution of neoplastic progression. Prognostic prediction plays a pivotal role in guiding the treatment of myelofibrosis. Mutation profiles and cytogenetic abnormalities have been integrated into advanced prognostic scoring systems and personalized risk stratification for MF. Presently, JAK inhibitors are part of the standard of care for MF, with newer generations developed for enhanced efficacy and reduced adverse effects. However, only a minority of patients have achieved a significant molecular-level response. Clinical trials exploring innovative approaches, such as combining hypomethylation agents that target epigenetic regulators, drugs proven effective in myelodysplastic syndrome, or immune and inflammatory modulators with JAK inhibitors, have demonstrated promising results. These combinations may be more effective in patients with high-risk mutations and complex mutation profiles. Expanding mutation profiling studies with more sensitive and specific molecular methods, as well as sequencing a broader spectrum of genes in clinical patients, may reveal molecular mechanisms in cases currently lacking detectable driver mutations, provide a better understanding of the association between genetic alterations and clinical phenotypes, and offer valuable information to advance personalized treatment protocols to improve long-term survival and eradicate mutant clones with the hope of curing MF.",

We used GBM-based data from The Cancer Genome Atals databases to analyze the expression pattern of miR-29b and different target genes, including NG2. Moreover, we investigated the regulatory function of miR-29b on NG2 expression and NG2-related signaling pathways. We further studied upstream mechanisms affecting miR-29b-dependent NG2 expression. We found that miR-29b downregulates NG2 expression directly and indirectly via the transcription factor Sp1. Furthermore, we identified the NG2 coreceptor platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)\u03b1 as an additional miR-29b target. As shown by a panel of functional cell assays, a reduced miR-29b-dependent NG2 expression suppresses tumor cell proliferation and migration. Signaling pathway analyses revealed that this is associated with a decreased ERK1/2 activity. In addition, we found that the long noncoding RNA H19 and c-Myc act as upstream repressors of miR-29b in GBM cells, resulting in an increased NG2 expression. These findings indicate that the c-Myc/H19/miR-29b axis crucially regulates NG2 expression in GBM and, thus, represents a target for the development of future GBM therapies.",

Although several existing online tools can annotate clusters with functional terms, there is no all-in-one webserver to effectively prioritize genes/clusters using gene essentiality as well as congruency of mRNA-protein expression. Hence, we developed CAP-RNAseq that makes possible (1) upload and clustering of bulk RNA-seq data followed by identification, annotation and network visualization of all or selected clusters; and (2) prioritization using DepMap gene essentiality and/or dependency scores as well as the degree of correlation between mRNA and protein levels of genes within an expression cluster. In addition, CAP-RNAseq has an integrated primer design tool for the prioritized genes. Herein, we showed using comparisons with the existing tools and multiple case studies that CAP-RNAseq can uniquely aid in the discovery of co-expression clusters enriched with essential genes and prioritization of novel biomarker genes that exhibit high correlations between their mRNA and protein expression levels.

          "abstract": "Replication stress (RS) is a characteristic state of cancer cells as they tend to exchange precision of replication for fast proliferation and increased genomic instability. To overcome the consequences of improper replication control, malignant cells frequently inactivate parts of their DNA damage response (DDR) pathways (the ATM-CHK2-p53 pathway), while relying on other pathways which help to maintain replication fork stability (ATR-CHK1). This creates a dependency on the remaining DDR pathways, vulnerability to further destabilization of replication and synthetic lethality of DDR inhibitors with common oncogenic alterations such as mutations of <i>TP53</i>, <i>RB1</i>, <i>ATM</i>, amplifications of <i>MYC</i>, <i>CCNE1</i> and others. The response to RS is normally limited by coordination of cell cycle, transcription and replication. Inhibition of WEE1 and PKMYT1 kinases, which prevent unscheduled mitosis entry, leads to fragility of under-replicated sites. Recent evidence also shows that inhibition of Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), such as CDK4/6, CDK2, CDK8/19 and CDK12/13 can contribute to RS through disruption of DNA repair and replication control. Here, we review the main causes of RS in cancers as well as main therapeutic targets-ATR, CHK1, PARP and their inhibitors.",

          "abstract": "For patients with high-risk or relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and the graft-versus-leukemia effect mediated by donor T cells, offer the best chance of long-term remission. However, the concurrent transfer of alloreactive T cells can lead to graft-versus-host disease that is associated with transplant-related morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, \u223c60% of patients will ultimately relapse after allo-HSCT, thus, underscoring the need for novel therapeutic strategies that are safe and effective. In this study, we explored the feasibility of immunotherapeutically targeting neoantigens, which arise from recurrent nonsynonymous mutations in AML and thus represent attractive targets because they are exclusively present on the tumor. Focusing on 14 recurrent driver mutations across 8 genes found in AML, we investigated their immunogenicity in 23 individuals with diverse HLA profiles. We demonstrate the immunogenicity of AML neoantigens, with 17 of 23 (74%) reactive donors screened mounting a response. The most immunodominant neoantigens were IDH2R140Q (n\u00a0= 11 of 17 responders), IDH1R132H (n\u00a0= 7 of 17), and FLT3D835Y (n\u00a0= 6 of 17). In-depth studies of IDH2R140Q-specific T cells revealed the presence of reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T\u00a0cells capable of recognizing distinct mutant-specific epitopes restricted to different HLA alleles. These neo-T cells could selectively recognize and kill HLA-matched AML targets endogenously expressing IDH2R140Q both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Overall, our findings support the clinical translation of neoantigen-specific T cells to treat relapsed/refractory AML.",

          "abstract": "Wound healing can be influenced by genes that control the circadian cycle, including Per2\u00a0and BMAL1, which coordinate the functions of several organs, including the skin. The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of PER2 during experimental skin wound healing. Two groups (control and Per2-KO), consisting of 14 male mice each, were anesthetized by inhalation, and two 6\u2009mm wounds were created on their dorsal skin using a punch biopsy. A silicone ring was sutured around the wound perimeter to restrict contraction. The wound healing process was clinically measured daily (closure index) until complete wound repair. On Day 6, histomorphometric analysis was performed using the length and thickness of the epithelial migration tongue, in addition to counting vessels underlying the lesion by immunofluorescence assay and maturation of collagen fibers through picrosirius staining. Bromodeoxyuridine\u00a0(BrdU) incorporation and quantification were performed using the subcutaneous injection technique 2\u2009h before euthanasia and through immunohistochemical analysis of the proliferative index. In addition, the qualitative analysis of myofibroblasts and periostin distribution in connective tissue was performed by immunofluorescence. Statistically significant differences were observed in the healing time between the experimental groups (means: 15.5 days for control mice and 13.5 days for Per2-KO; p\u2009=\u20090.001). The accelerated healing observed in the Per2-KO group (p\u2009<\u20090.05) was accompanied by statistical differences in wound diameter and length of the migrating epithelial tongue (p\u2009=\u20090.01) compared to the control group. Regarding BrdU immunoreactivity, higher expression was observed in the intact epithelium of Per2-KO animals (p\u2009=\u20090.01), and this difference compared to control was also present, to a lesser extent, at the wound site (p\u2009=\u20090.03). Immunofluorescence in the connective tissue underlying the wound showed a higher angiogenic potential in the Per2-KO group in the intact tissue area and the wound region (p\u2009<\u20090.01), where increased expression of myofibroblasts was also observed. Qualitative analysis revealed the distribution of periostin protein and collagen fibers in the connective tissue underlying the wound, with greater organization and maturation during the analyzed period. Our research showed that the absence of the Per2 gene positively impacts the healing time of the skin in vivo.\u00a0This acceleration depends on the increase of epithelial proliferative and angiogenic capacity of cells carrying the Per2 deletion.",

Hyperactivation of RAF proteins, particularly BRAF and CRAF, drives tumour progression and drug resistance in many types of cancer. Although BRAF is the most studied RAF protein, partially owing to its high mutation incidence in melanoma, the role of CRAF in tumourigenesis and drug resistance is becoming increasingly clinically relevant. Here, we summarize the main known regulatory mechanisms and gene alterations that contribute to CRAF activity, highlighting the different oncogenic roles of CRAF, and categorize RAF1 (CRAF) mutations according to the effect on kinase activity. Additionally, we emphasize the effect that CRAF alterations may have on drug resistance and how precision therapies could effectively target CRAF-dependent tumours.

          "abstract": "Dysregulated Notch signalling contributes to breast cancer development and progression, but validated tools to measure the level of Notch signalling in breast cancer subtypes and in response to systemic therapy are largely lacking. A transcriptomic signature of Notch signalling would be warranted, for example to monitor the effects of future Notch-targeting therapies and to learn whether altered Notch signalling is an off-target effect of current breast cancer therapies. In this report, we have established such a classifier. To generate the signature, we first identified Notch-regulated genes from six basal-like breast cancer cell lines subjected to elevated or reduced Notch signalling by culturing on immobilized Notch ligand Jagged1 or blockade of Notch by \u03b3-secretase inhibitors, respectively. From this cadre of Notch-regulated genes, we developed candidate transcriptomic signatures that were trained on a breast cancer patient dataset (the TCGA-BRCA cohort) and a broader breast cancer cell line cohort and sought to validate in independent datasets. An optimal 20-gene transcriptomic signature was selected. We validated the signature on two independent patient datasets (METABRIC and Oslo2), and it showed an improved coherence score and tumour specificity compared with previously published signatures. Furthermore, the signature score was particularly high for basal-like breast cancer, indicating an enhanced level of Notch signalling in this subtype. The signature score was increased after neoadjuvant treatment in the PROMIX and BEAUTY patient cohorts, and a lower signature score generally correlated with better clinical outcome. The 20-gene transcriptional signature will be a valuable tool to evaluate the response of future Notch-targeting therapies for breast cancer, to learn about potential effects on Notch signalling from conventional breast cancer therapies and to better stratify patients for therapy considerations.",

In the present study, we particularly focused on elucidating the factors impacting on the clinical translation of MTB recommendations, utilizing data generated from gene panel mediated comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of 554 patients at the MTB of the Comprehensive Cancer Center Erlangen, Germany, during the years 2016 to 2020. A subgroup analysis of cases with available follow-up data (<i>n</i> = 332) revealed 139 cases with a molecularly informed MTB recommendation, which was successfully implemented in the clinic in 44 (31.7%) of these cases. Here, the molecularly matched treatment was applied in 45.4% (<i>n</i> = 20/44) of cases for \u22656 months and in 25% (<i>n</i> = 11/44) of cases for 12 months or longer (median time to treatment failure, TTF: 5 months, min: 1 month, max: 38 months, ongoing at data cut-off). In general, recommendations were preferentially implemented in the clinic when of high (i.e., tier 1) clinical evidence level. In particular, this was the case for MTB recommendations suggesting the application of PARP, PIK3CA, and IDH1/2 inhibitors. The main reason for non-compliance to the MTB recommendation was either the application of non-matched treatment modalities (<i>n</i> = 30)/stable disease (<i>n</i> = 7), or deteriorating patient condition (<i>n</i> = 22)/death of patient (<i>n</i> = 9). In summary, this study provides an insight into the factors affecting the clinical implementation of molecularly informed MTB recommendations, and careful considerations of these factors may guide future processes of clinical decision making.",

Thus, more effective therapeutics are needed to improve patient outcomes. We evaluated the radiosensitizing effects of ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related (ATR) inhibitor (ATRi) BAY 1895344 in preclinical models of HNSCC. Murine and human HPV-negative HNSCC cells (MOC2, MOC1, JHU-012) were treated with vehicle or ATRi with or without 4 Gy. Checkpoint kinase 1 phosphorylation and DNA damage (\u03b3H2AX) were evaluated by Western blot, and ATRi half-maximal inhibitory concentration was determined by MTT assay for HNSCC cells and immortalized murine oral keratinocytes. In vitro radiosensitization was tested by clonogenic assay. Cell cycle distribution and mitotic catastrophe were evaluated by flow cytometry. Mitotic aberrations were quantified by fluorescent microscopy. Tumor growth delay and survival were assessed in mice bearing MOC2 or JHU-012 transplant tumors treated with vehicle, ATRi, RT (10 Gy \u00d7 1 or 8 Gy \u00d7 3), or combined ATRi + RT. ATRi caused dose-dependent reduction in checkpoint kinase 1 phosphorylation at 1 hour post-RT (4 Gy) and dose-dependent increase in \u03b3H2AX at 18 hours post-RT. Addition of RT to ATRi led to decreased BAY 1895344 half-maximal inhibitory concentration in HNSCC cell lines but not in normal tissue surrogate immortalized murine oral keratinocytes. Clonogenic assays demonstrated radiosensitization in the HNSCC cell lines. ATRi abrogated the RT-induced G2/M checkpoint, leading to mitosis with unrepaired DNA damage and increased mitotic aberrations (multinucleated cells, micronuclei, nuclear buds, nucleoplasmic bridges). ATRi and RT significantly delayed tumor growth in MOC2 and JHU-012 in vivo models, with improved overall survival in the MOC2 model. These findings demonstrated that BAY 1895344 increased in vitro and in vivo radiosensitivity in HPV-negative HNSCC preclinical models, suggesting therapeutic potential warranting evaluation in clinical trials for patients with locally advanced or recurrent HPV-negative HNSCC.",

Applying this methodology to lymphoma cells, we conducted a genome-wide screen to identify novel inhibitors of tumour expansion that are induced by the tumour suppressor TRP53. We discovered that the absence of Arrestin domain containing 3 (ARRDC3) increases the survival and long-term competitiveness of MYC-driven lymphoma cells when treated with anti-cancer agents that activate TRP53. Deleting Arrdc3 in mice caused perinatal lethality due to various developmental abnormalities, including cardiac defects. Notably, the absence of ARRDC3 markedly accelerated MYC-driven lymphoma development. Thus, ARRDC3 is a new mediator of TRP53-mediated suppression of tumour expansion, and this discovery may open new avenues to harness this process for cancer therapy.",

Here, through a bioinformatic analysis of public databases, we performed a characterization of GLYAT expression levels in KIRC cases. Our goal is to evaluate whether GLYAT could serve as a compelling candidate for an in-depth study, given its pivotal role in metabolic regulation and previously established links to other malignancies. The analysis showed a marked decrease in GLYAT expression in all stages and grades of KIRC, regardless of mutation rates, suggesting an alternative mechanism of regulation along the tumor development. Additionally, we observed a hypomethylation in the GLYAT promoter region and a negative correlation between the expression of the GLYAT and the levels of cancer-associated fibroblasts. Finally, the data show a correlation between higher levels of GLYAT expression and better patient prognosis. In conclusion, this article underscores the potential of GLYAT as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in KIRC.",

From now on, the issue is to shorten the time to treatment. Here, we challenge two well-known rapid strategies for <i>EGFR</i> testing: the cartridge-based platform Idylla\u2122 (Biocartis) and a digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) approach (ID_Solution). To thoroughly investigate each testing performance, we selected a highly comprehensive cohort of 39 unique del19 (in comparison, the cbioportal contains 40 unique del19), and 9 samples bearing unique polymorphisms in exon 19. Additional L858R (N = 24), L861Q (N = 1), del19 (N = 63), and WT samples (N = 34) were used to determine clear technical and biological cutoffs. A total of 122 DNA samples extracted from formaldehyde-fixed samples was used as input. No false positive results were reported for either of the technologies, as long as careful droplet selection (ddPCR) was ensured for two polymorphisms. ddPCR demonstrated higher sensitivity in detecting unique del19 (92.3%, 36/39) compared to Idylla (67.7%, 21/31). However, considering the prevalence of del19 and L858R in the lung cancer population, the adjusted theranostic values were similar (96.51% and 95.26%, respectively). ddPCR performs better for small specimens and low tumoral content, but in other situations, Idylla is an alternative (especially if a molecular platform is absent).",

This protein is also known as LASS2 (LAG1 longevity assurance homolog 2) and TMSG1 (tumor metastasis-suppressor gene 1). Although previously described as a tumor suppressor for different types of cancer, such as prostate or liver cancer, it has also been observed to promote tumor growth in adenocarcinoma. In this review, we focus on the influence of CERS2 in bladder cancer (BC), approaching the existing literature about its structure and activity, as well as the miRNAs regulating its expression. From a mechanistic point of view, different explanations for the role of CERS2 as an antitumor protein have been proposed, including the production of long-chain ceramides, interaction with vacuolar ATPase, and its function as inhibitor of mitochondrial fission. In addition, we reviewed the literature specifically studying the expression of this gene in both BC and biopsy-derived tumor cell lines, complementing this with an analysis of public gene expression data and its association with disease progression. We also discuss the importance of CERS2 as a biomarker and the presence of CERS2 mRNA in extracellular vesicles isolated from urine.",

In vitro experiments confirmed that overexpression of KCNQ4 inhibited cell migration and invasion and promoted apoptosis. In summary, our comprehensive pan-cancer analysis highlights the potential of KCNQ4 as a cancer marker, and can be used as an auxiliary prognostic indicator and an indicator for immunotherapy in certain tumor types.",

These routes of metastatic dissemination can be reconstructed from tumor sequencing data, but current reconstruction methods scale poorly or rely on assumptions that do not reflect known biology. Metient overcomes these limitations using gradient-based, multiobjective optimization to generate multiple hypotheses of metastatic spread that are rescored using independent genetic distance and organotropism data. Unlike current methods, Metient can be used with both clinical sequencing data and barcode-based lineage tracing in preclinical models. Here, applied to data from 167 patients and 479 tumors, Metient identifies distinct trends of metastatic dissemination in melanoma, high-risk neuroblastoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Its reconstructions usually match expert analyses but Metient often finds other plausible migration histories, ultimately positing more polyclonal and metastasis-to-metastasis seeding than previously reported. Metient's reconstructions thus challenge existing assumptions about metastatic dissemination and offer insights into cancer type-specific patterns of metastatic spread.",

Most of these genes play a role in the occurrence and progression of some solid tumors. Sufficient systematic studies have not been performed on the expression characteristics of the role of NTN1 and its receptors in the context of pan-cancer. Based on data from 10,437 subjects with 33 types of solid tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we systematically analyzed the tumor molecular biological characteristics of NTN1 and its receptors through bioinformatics. Candidate small-molecule drugs were identified based on molecular docking analysis. Netrin-1 and its receptors exhibited stereotypical genetic alterations in tumor-suppressor genes or oncogenes. Promoter methylation and miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional inhibition likely represent the primary regulatory mechanisms, whereas the promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) emerges as a conserved cellular function. we predicted potential small-molecule drugs that could bind to Netrin1 receptors. NTN1 and its receptors can be used as potential targets for tumor immunotherapy. Our results showed the important cancer biological functions of NTN1 and its receptors and their transformational value as candidate tumor biomarkers. This study also showed some critical potential immune-related therapeutic targets and provided a basis for future studies on their role in clinical immunotherapy.",

This study aims to define the pan-cancer immunological significance and therapeutic potential of MCRS1, with focused mechanistic dissection of its epigenetic-driven roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. An integrated multi-omics approach was employed, encompassing bulk transcriptomics, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), and functional validation. Data from public repositories including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) were analyzed using tools such as SangerBox, University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer (UALCAN), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), Kaplan-Meier plotter, and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER). Expression patterns, prognostic significance, epigenetic regulation, interactions with immune infiltrates, and functional impact of MCRS1 on HCC malignant phenotypes were comprehensively assessed. MCRS1 was upregulated in 24 malignancies (including HCC) and correlated with advanced stage, poor differentiation, and reduced survival (P<0.001). Hypomethylation of the MCRS1 promoter drove its overexpression in HCC, strongly associating with tumor progression. MCRS1 recruited M2-polarized macrophages (Rho =0.423, P=1.90e-16) and myeloid dendritic cells (Rho =0.560, P=7.87e-30). Spatial mapping confirmed MCRS1<sup>+</sup>/CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophage colocalization in tumor niches. MCRS1 knockdown suppressed HCC proliferation, migration, and invasion. scRNA-seq revealed MCRS1 enrichment in immunosuppressive clusters expressing <i>VEGFA</i>/<i>TGFB1</i>. Our pan-cancer analysis identifies MCRS1 as a key node linking epigenetic dysregulation and immunosuppression in HCC. Its promoter hypomethylation-driven overexpression is associated with an M2 macrophage-polarized, immune-resistant niche. These findings suggest that targeting MCRS1 may represent a strategy to overcome resistance to current immunotherapies.",

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were performed on cDNA microarrays to verify the transcriptional levels of potential antigens. The immune subtypes were delineated using consensus clustering and module eigengenes were calculated by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). We identified 5 tumor antigens with overexpression and mutation, which were associated with antigen-presentation and poor prognosis. A total of two subtypes (IS1 and IS2) were identified, and IS1 showed a better prognosis. The mutation count and tumor mutation burden were slightly higher, whereas immune checkpoint genes were lower in IS2. Compared with IS1, an increase in immune and stromal cell infiltration was associated with IS2, indicating that IS2 is immunologically \"hot\" and IS1 is immunologically \"cold\". Furthermore, ESCA patients' immune cell components were identified and survival outcome predictions were made by immune landscape construction. Immune hub genes, such as DKK1, could serve as biomarkers for predicting the prognosis and for vaccination. Finally, drug sensitivity analysis showed that IS1 patients might have higher sensitivity to TOP9 drugs with significant differences, which emphasized the importance of individualized treatment for ESCAs. We identified ANGPT2, CRIPT, GLA, LMNB1, and MARVELD3 as potential tumor antigens. Our study implies that IS2 phenotype might benefit from mRNA vaccination.",

Significant correlations between microbiota and AP-2 were observed in 18 of 33 analyzed tumor types; <i>TFAP2E-AS1</i> was most recurrent among AP-2 members, and Halomonas was most recurrent among genera. Further species-level verification and prognostic importance nominated three promising pairs: <i>Paraburkholderia fungorum-TFAP2E</i> in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), <i>Actinomyces oris-TFAP2E</i> in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBC), and <i>Cutibacterium granulosum-TFAP2B</i> in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD). An attempt to define a consensus expression signature driven by microbiota and AP-2, yet independent of the specific species or family member, revealed genes regulating various biological processes and pathways. ACC and DLBC shared a consensus expression program, whereas STAD diverged; chromatin analysis showed AP-2 motifs near microbe-responsive genes in ACC and DLBC but not STAD, supporting cohort-specific regulation.

The <i>TP53</i> R273C mutation, frequently observed in brain tumors, may influence LGIMA biology and aggressiveness. We analyzed 14 <i>TP53</i>-mutant LGIMAs using NGS. Five tumors (33.3%) carried the R273C mutation; these were mostly of grade 2 and all from female patients. Ki-67 levels in R273C-mutant tumors were higher compared with those in other <i>TP53</i>-mutant grade 2 tumors but lower than those in grade 3 tumors, which may suggest that R273C defines a more aggressive grade 2 profile. This mutation was linked to loss of the wild-type allele, supporting a loss-of-function mechanism. Its frequency was found to be potentially higher in women, and this sex-based difference reached statistical significance when incorporating TCGA LGIMA data. Overall, the R273C mutation, although mechanistically unclear, is more prevalent than other <i>TP53</i> variants and defines a distinct biological subset of LGIMAs, marked by increased Ki-67 and female predominance. Incorporating <i>TP53</i> and broader genetic profiling via NGS could improve our understanding of LGIMAs and support a refined classification system, enhancing diagnostic and prognostic accuracy.",

          "abstract": "KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> is one of the most prevalent driver mutations in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC). Although this genetic alteration is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy, additional genomic features may contribute to the behavior of KRAS-mutant PDACs and CRCs. Here, we aimed at defining the landscape of these additional genomic features of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>-mutant PDAC and CRC, and their impact on clinical outcomes. This retrospective analysis utilized circulating tumor DNA data from two cohorts with advanced CRC and PDAC: a national cohort from Guardant (n = 27,497) and a Mayo Clinic cohort (n = 1434). Patients were categorized into three groups: KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> alone, KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> with putative resistance alterations, and KRAS not detected (ND). Genomic co-occurrences were summarized. Overall survival (OS) was compared among groups using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable survival analysis. Among patients with KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> mutation, additional oncogenic alterations were detected in 34.5% of CRC and 11.5% of PDAC in the national cohort; 38.9% of CRC, and 17.4% of PDAC in the Mayo cohort. Common additional oncogenic alterations included EGFR amplifications, additional KRAS point mutations, and alterations in NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA. Patients with KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> and these alterations had significantly shorter median OS compared with those with KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> alone and KRAS ND for CRC (p < 0.0001) and PDAC (p < 0.0001). Presence of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> and additional oncogenic alterations was the only variable significantly associated with OS outcomes in both CRC and PDAC. We described the genomic landscape of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>-mutant CRC and PDAC, demonstrating that cases often have additional oncogenic alterations linked to resistance to KRAS inhibition. These alterations are also associated with a worse prognosis. Recognizing these alterations may inform new therapeutic strategies. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings in ongoing clinical trials.",

          "abstract": "Drug resistance remains a major obstacle to successful chemotherapy, leading to treatment failure and tumor recurrence. Recent studies indicate that mutations in FAT Atypical Cadherin 1 (<i>FAT1</i>) contribute to drug resistance in cancer cells. However, the precise role and underlying mechanisms of <i>FAT1</i> in breast cancer (BC) remain insufficiently explored. Here, we conducted a comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analysis, identifying <i>FAT1</i> as a crucial tumor suppressor gene in BC. Our study demonstrates that genomic alterations in <i>FAT1</i> are associated with the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway activation. We further show that <i>FAT1</i> loss induces cyclophosphamide (CTX) resistance and leads to the upregulation of the Wnt signaling cascade, accompanied by the accumulation of CTNNB1 transcription factors. Notably, combination therapy effectively alleviates drug resistance by suppressing the Wnt pathway. These findings highlight the critical role of <i>FAT1</i> loss in mediating CTX resistance in BC and provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting the Wnt pathway.",

          "abstract": "Baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis protein repeat-containing protein 5 (BIRC5), also known as survivin, belongs to the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) family and serves as a key regulator of cellular survival and programmed cell death. Current research has demonstrated that BIRC5 exhibits high expression levels in many cancers. Furthermore, its overexpression significantly correlates with poor clinical outcomes and contributes to tumor progression and metastasis. We utilized TCGAplot R package (v8.0.0), Sangerbox3.0, GEPIA2, cBioPortal, UALCAN, TISIDB, BioGRID, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to decipher the close association of BIRC5 with tumor occurrence and development as well as its involvement in gene mutations, methylation patterns, immune infiltration levels, functional aspects, and prognosis outcomes. Additionally, the expression of BIRC5 was assessed through western blot analysis following siRNA transfection in Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell lines. CCK-8 and Colony Formation Assays quantified proliferative changes in H1299 and A549 cells following BIRC5 downregulation. Pan-cancer\u00a0analysis has demonstrated that BIRC5 expression is frequently upregulated in various tumor types. The dysregulation of BIRC5 has been strongly linked to poor clinical prognosis across various cancers. Moreover, alterations in BIRC5 gene have been observed in different tumors. Compared with normal tissues, the BIRC5 promoter region shows abnormal methylation levels in most cancer tissues. Additionally, BIRC5 is implicated in immune infiltration and immune cell composition with the tumor microenvironment (TME), suggesting its potential role in shaping the immunological landscape of cancer. The study also elucidates the correlation between BIRC5 and immune checkpoint (ICP) expression. Furthermore, scRNA-seq findings underscore the pivotal role played by BIRC5 in regulating a wide range of biological behaviors such as cell cycle progression, DNA damage, DNA repair response, proliferation, and invasion within tumors. Experimental evidence further confirms that knockdown of BIRC5 effectively inhibits LUAD proliferation. Our research systematically highlighted the profound association between BIRC5 expression and various clinical characteristics, survival, mutation patterns, and TME in many cancers. These analyses yield valuable perspectives on BIRC5\u2019s function across different cancers. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12885-025-15184-8.",

We first identified differentially expressed SE-associated genes between BC patients and healthy controls. Subsequently, Cox regression analysis and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm were applied to evacuate SE-associated genes that related to the overall survival (OS) of patients. The Super-Enhancer-Related Score (SERS) was then calculated based on the LASSO coefficients and incorporated with clinical features to construct a clinical prediction model. Besides, we applied multiple bioinformatic approaches to investigate the potential regulatory mechanism of SE-associated genes using bulk RNA and single-cell RNA sequencing data. Finally, the hub gene was identified using various machine learning methods and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay. We found that SERS was negatively correlated with OS of BC patients. Both time-dependent ROC analysis and calibration curves demonstrated the strong predictive ability and high accuracy of the prediction model we built. Significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of tumor mutation burden, tumor immune microenvironment, and drug sensitivity. Importantly, we identified TFF1 as the core gene, and the immunohistochemical (IHC) assay using the tissue microarray revealed that TFF1-positive patients had significantly better OS than their counterparts. We constructed a highly precise clinical prediction model based on SERS, demonstrating the impact of SE-associated genes on the prognosis of BC patients and their regulatory effects on somatic mutations, tumor immune microenvironment, and drug sensitivity in BC.",

Ribonucleotide reductase subunit M2 (RRM2) has been implicated in the progression of various cancers, but its role in LUAD remains underexplored. This study aims to elucidate the expression patterns, clinical significance, and regulatory mechanisms of RRM2 in LUAD. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of RRM2 expression using data from the Genomic Data Commons Data Portal and The Cancer Genome Atlas. Survival analysis was performed using the KM plotter tool. The starBase database was utilized to identify miRNAs associated with RRM2. Single-cell RNA sequencing data was analyzed to explore the correlation between RRM2 and immune cell infiltration. <i>In vitro</i> experiments were conducted to validate the regulatory role of let-7c-5p on RRM2 in LUAD cell lines. We found that the expression of RRM2 in LUAD tissues was significantly higher than in normal tissues, and its expression was associated with advanced pathological stage and poor overall survival. Additionally, we identified Let-7c-5p as a potential upstream regulator of RRM2, which is down-regulated in LAUD and negatively correlated with RRM2 expression. <i>In vitro</i> experiments showed that overexpression of let-7c-5p reduced RRM2 levels and inhibited LUAD cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, RRM2 expression was positively correlated with the infiltration of certain immune cells, suggesting its role in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment. Our findings suggest that RRM2 is closely associated with the malignant progression of LUAD and may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker with clinical relevance.

The results were validated using in vitro clonal survival assays of CRISPR-engineered NSCLC cell lines. A total of 181 patients were analyzed, with a median follow-up of 15.2 months (IQR, 8.0-31.9 months). The 3-year risk of local failure was 0.15 (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.20).

Utilizing bulk RNA-seq (TCGA/GTEx/CPTAC), immune deconvolution, proteomics, and functional enrichment, we analyzed UBD expression, survival prognosis, immune infiltration, and molecular pathways across 33 cancers. Molecular docking and MD simulations were performed to assess UBD-protein interactions. Through lentivirus-mediated overexpression, functional assays (CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, and Transwell), transcriptome sequencing, and biochemical validation, we demonstrated that UBD promotes malignant phenotypes in esophageal cancer via the TP53 signaling pathway. UBD was upregulated in 14 cancers but downregulated in thyroid carcinoma (THCA) and kidney chromophobe (KICH). ROC analysis highlighted UBD's diagnostic potential (AUC >0.8 in gastrointestinal tumors). High UBD conferred protection in melanoma (SKCM, HR\u00a0=\u00a00.891) and sarcoma (SARC, HR\u00a0=\u00a00.899) but predicted poor outcomes in uveal melanoma (UVM, HR\u00a0=\u00a01.298) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD, HR\u00a0=\u00a01.143).UBD positively correlated with the IFN-\u03b3-dominant immune subtype (C2), characterized by CD8+ T cells/M1 macrophages. Drug sensitivity profiling nominated imatinib (Vina score: -8.9 kcal/mol) and TTNPB as potential therapies for UBD-high tumors, validated by stable MD simulations. In esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), UBD expression escalated with tumor stage and predicted poor survival (p<0.05).UBD enhances the proliferation and migration of esophageal cancer cells by modulating the TP53 signaling pathway, as validated through transcriptomic analysis and functional assays.

Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, genome-wide association studies, and bioinformatics methods have revealed greater insights into the pathogenesis of complex diseases. Network biology-based approaches have been used to identify complex protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that can lead to potential drug targets. There is a need to better understand PPIs specific to urothelial carcinoma. This study aimed to elucidate PPIs specific to papillary and nonpapillary urothelial carcinoma and identify the most connected or \"hub\" proteins, as these are potential drug targets. A novel PPI analysis tool, Proteinarium, was used to analyze RNA sequencing data from 132 patients with papillary and 270 patients with nonpapillary urothelial carcinoma from the TCGA Cell 2017 dataset and 39 patients with papillary and 88 patients with nonpapillary urothelial carcinoma from the TCGA Nature 2014 dataset. Hub proteins were identified in distinct PPI networks specific to papillary and nonpapillary urothelial carcinoma. Statistical significance of clusters was assessed using the Fisher exact test (P<.001), and network separation was quantified using the interactome-based separation score. RPS27A, UBA52, and VAMP8 were the most connected or \"hub\" proteins identified in the network specific to the papillary urothelial carcinoma. In the network specific to the nonpapillary carcinoma, GNB1, RHOA, UBC, and FPR2 were found to be the hub proteins. Notably, GNB1 and FPR2 were among the proteins that have existing drugs targeting them.

However, recent publications show that many premalignant lesions comprise multiple clones expressing different mutant APC proteins<sup>1-4</sup>. Here, by mediating transformation on different mouse backgrounds containing mutations in Kras or other common CRC driver genes, we establish that the presence of diverse priming events in the normal mouse intestinal epithelium can change the transformation and clonal-selection landscape, permitting the fixation of strong driver mutations in Apc and Ctnnb1 that are otherwise lost due to negative selection. These findings, combined with our demonstration of mutational patterns consistent with similar priming events in human CRC, suggest that the order in which driver mutations occur in intestinal epithelium can determine whether clones are positively or negatively selected and can shape subsequent tumour development.",

A defining feature of GBM is the existence of spatially and functionally distinct cellular niches, where malignant cells engage in paracrine crosstalk with cell types comprising the tumor microenvironment. Here, we identify pericytes as the most active paracrine signaling hub within the tumor parenchyma. Their depletion through genetic engineering results in accelerated tumor progression and shortened survival. Mechanistic studies reveal that pericyte deficiency remodels the endothelium and impacts the immune cell landscape, exacerbating tumor cell invasion and immune suppression. Specifically, the pericyte-deprived endothelium recruits perivascular, tumor-associated macrophages polarized towards an immune-suppressive phenotype. The recruited macrophages express Hepatocyte Growth Factor, which reinforces activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase MET on GBM cells harboring a pronounced mesenchymal subtype driven by the key phenotypic regulator Fosl1. Indeed, orthotopic implantation of MET-expressing GBM cells corroborates their superior tumor-initiating and invasive capabilities. Thus, pericytes represent critical modulators of GBM development by orchestrating a tumor-suppressive microenvironment, highlighting the importance of their preservation in therapy.",

Nevertheless, the prognostic implications of ZHX factors in esophageal carcinoma (EC) remain unclear. Bioinformatic analyses were conducted to evaluate the transcription levels of ZHX factors and their corresponding prognostic significance in EC. Immunohistochemistry was further utilized to assess the association between ZHX3 protein expression and clinicopathologic variables as well as survival outcomes in patient with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Data from online databases showed no association between ZHX mRNA expression levels and overall survival (OS) in EC patients. However, subgroup analyses revealed significant associations between the expression of ZHX factors and survival outcomes in selected patient cohorts. Immunohistochemical analysis supported that high ZHX3 protein expression was associated with advanced histological grade and unfavorable OS in ESCC patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that ZHX3 expression was an independent prognostic predictor for patient survival. These observations by means of combining bioinformatics and immunohistochemical analyses suggest that ZHX factors is involved in disease progression and may be potential biomarkers for predicting more accurate prognosis for EC patients.",

          "abstract": "TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion (T:E fusion) in prostate adenocarcinoma (PCa) puts ERG under androgen receptor-regulated (AR-regulated) TMPRSS2 expression. T:E fusion is associated with PTEN loss and is highly associated with decreased INPP4B expression, which together may compensate for ERG-mediated suppression of AKT signaling. We confirmed in PCa cells and a mouse PCa model that ERG suppresses IRS2 and AKT activation. In contrast, ERG downregulation did not increase INPP4B, suggesting its decrease is indirect and reflects selective pressure to suppress INPP4B function. Notably, INPP4B expression was decreased in PTEN-intact and PTEN-deficient T:E fusion tumors, suggesting selection for a nonredundant function. As ERG in T:E fusion tumors is AR regulated, we further assessed whether AR inhibition increases AKT activity in T:E fusion tumors. A T:E fusion-positive PDX had increased AKT activity in vivo and response to AKT inhibition in vitro after androgen deprivation. Moreover, two clinical trials of neoadjuvant AR inhibition prior to radical prostatectomy showed greater increases in AKT activation in the T:E fusion-positive versus -negative tumors. These findings indicate that AKT activation may mitigate the efficacy of AR-targeted therapy in T:E fusion PCa and that these patients may most benefit from combination therapy targeting AR and AKT.",

Here, we identified Zinc Finger MIZ-Type Containing 1 (Zmiz1) as a coregulator of uterine estrogen signaling. ZMIZ1 is colocalized with an estrogen receptor \u03b1-binding (ESR1-binding) super enhancer. ZMIZ1 mutations are found in endometrial cancer and its RNA levels trend toward reduction in endometrium of patients with endometriosis. ZMIZ1 is dynamically expressed in human endometrial tissues during the menstrual cycle. Disrupting ZMIZ1 in cultured human endometrial stromal cells resulted in impaired cell proliferation and decidual differentiation. Ablation of Zmiz1 using the PgrCre mouse (Zmiz1d/d) resulted in infertility and accelerated age-dependent uterine fibrosis. Zmiz1d/d mice showed reduced ovulation and progesterone levels while maintaining normal serum prolactin during pregnancy. Uteri of Zmiz1d/d mice were unable to undergo a hormonally induced decidual response, had decreased expression of stromal progesterone receptor (PGR) and decreased stromal and epithelial cell proliferation. Analysis of the transcriptome of Zmiz1d/d mouse uteri showed decreased E2F, CCNA2, and FOXM1 signaling. Challenging ovariectomized Zmiz1d/d mice with estrogen resulted in a decreased amplitude of some estrogen-regulated gene responses. Our findings demonstrate the importance of ZMIZ1 as an ESR1 coregulator in uterine biology and pathology.",

          "abstract": "Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is an aggressive malignancy with high recurrence and poor survival, accounting for the majority of bladder cancer-related deaths. A subset of MIBC harbors FGFR1 amplification or overexpression, associated with increased proliferation and poor prognosis. Although the pan-FGFR inhibitor erdafitinib has demonstrated clinical benefit in patients with FGFR3/FGFR2 alterations, primarily in non-MIBC, its efficacy is limited by resistance and toxicity. Moreover, its effectiveness in FGFR1-driven MIBC remains unclear. To address this gap, we investigated erdafitinib response and resistance mechanisms in JMSU1 cells, a model of FGFR1-amplified MIBC. While erdafitinib initially suppressed tumor growth, prolonged treatment led to resistance, characterized by persistent activation of ERK, AKT, and STAT1 signaling pathways. Mechanistic studies identified MET activation, driven by MET gene amplification, as a key driver of resistance. Notably, exogenous hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) not only induced resistance but also accelerated the emergence of MET-amplified, HGF-independent subpopulations under drug pressure. We also identified SHP2 as a critical mediator of FGFR1-driven ERK activation in parental cells. In resistant cells, MET activation enhanced SHP2-ERK signaling through the adaptor protein GAB1, reinforcing the resistant phenotype. Combined inhibition of FGFR1 and MET significantly suppressed tumor growth in resistant cells. These findings establish MET amplification and GAB1-SHP2 signaling as central mediators of erdafitinib resistance in FGFR1-amplified MIBC and support dual FGFR1/MET targeting as a promising therapeutic strategy.",

          "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with limited therapeutic options. Neoantigen-based immunotherapy offers a promising avenue, but its efficacy primarily depends on the ability of somatic mutations to generate immunogenic peptides effectively presented by HLA class I molecules and recognized by cytotoxic T cells, in concert with innate immune mechanisms such as NK-cell activation and DAMP/PAMP signaling. This study aimed to characterize the MHC-I binding diversity of peptides derived from GBM-associated somatic variants, with a particular focus on interactions involving HLA-A68:01 and HLA-B15:01 alleles. These alleles were selected based on their ethnic prevalence and potential structural compatibility with neoepitopes. <b>Methods:</b> Somatic missense variants from TCGA-GBM were filtered using high-confidence genomic databases, including dbSNP, COSMIC, and MANE. Neoepitope prediction was performed across multiple HLA class I alleles using binding affinity algorithms (MHCflurry2). Peptide-HLA interactions were characterized through motif analysis and anchor residue enrichment. Structural modeling of peptide-HLA complexes was conducted using ColabFold (AlphaFold2-multimer v3) to evaluate conformational stability. The population frequency of selected HLA alleles was examined through epidemiological comparisons. <b>Results:</b> Canonical GBM driver mutations (e.g., EGFR, TP53, PIK3R1) are recurrent and biologically relevant, although pharmacological inhibition of EGFR alone has not consistently improved patient outcomes, underscoring the complex signaling redundancy in glioblastoma. HLA-A68:01 exhibited high binding affinity and favorable motif compatibility, supporting its potential for effective neoantigen presentation. HLA-B15:01 was identified as a viable presenter for the EGFR p.Arg108Lys variant. Structural modeling confirmed stable peptide insertion into the MHC-I binding groove, with high-confidence folding and preserved interface integrity. Ethnic distribution analysis revealed varying GBM incidence across populations expressing these alleles. <b>Conclusions:</b> This integrative analysis identified structurally validated, immunogenically promising neoantigens derived from GBM mutations, particularly for HLA-A68:01 and HLA-B15:01. These findings support allele-informed neoepitope prioritization in personalized immunotherapy, especially for patient populations with corresponding HLA genotypes and MHC-I presentation capacity.",

We employed survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method and utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to investigate the roles of RBP4 and RBP7 in the tumor microenvironment. Our analysis revealed significant downregulation of RBPs in multiple cancers, with RBP4 and RBP7 showing notable expression variations linked to tumor stages and grades. Cox analysis identified RBP4 as a protective gene in kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and mesothelioma (MESO), while RBP7 exhibited protective effects in breast cancer (BRCA) and uveal melanoma (UVM). This pan-cancer and single-cell integrative analysis highlights the complex roles of RBPs in cancer progression and their potential as prognostic biomarkers, particularly RBP4 and RBP7 in breast cancer. These findings warrant further investigation into the functional mechanisms of RBPs, which may provide valuable strategies for therapeutic interventions.",

Tumors were genotyped for KRAS (and BRAF in AC-ICAM), and relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were investigated. KRAS G12A comprised 3.0% (FMU) and 3.4% (AC-ICAM). Across genotypes, G12A showed the highest univariable hazards compared to wild-type (WT) references for both RFS and OS in each cohort. Notably, RFS events among G12A clustered within 12 months of surgery. In multivariable Cox models, G12A remained independently associated with worse RFS and OS in each cohort, whereas non-G12A KRAS mutations did not differ significantly from the WT references. Across two cohorts, KRAS G12A identified a small but clinically meaningful high-risk subset of stage II-III CRC characterized by early recurrence and inferior survival. Recognition of this variant may inform postoperative risk stratification in the adjuvant setting.",

Of note, various studies have shown that EWS-FLI1-mediated transcription programs are facilitated via direct recruitment and binding of the NuRD-LSD1 complex, regulating its associated gene targets. Furthermore, LSD1 inhibition exhibited reverse transcriptional profiles driven by ETS-FLI and reduced in vivo tumorigenesis in cancers. We evaluated FLI1 expression across multiple invasive breast carcinoma (IBC) cohorts to determine its prognostic significance and associations with stromal features. In parallel, we investigated FLI1 regulation in humanized breast cancer mouse models treated with an LSD1 inhibitor. High FLI1 expression was associated with advanced histological grade in IBC, consistent with an oncogenic function. FLI1-high tumors also exhibited elevated stromal and immune scores, indicating a role in remodeling the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, LSD1 inhibition downregulated FLI1 target genes involving angiogenesis and invasion. These findings highlight the dual role of FLI1: tumor-intrinsic FLI1 promotes proliferation and invasion, whereas its transcriptional regulation in tumor and endothelial compartments likely reflects LSD1 dependence. Collectively, our results support a mechanistic model in which LSD1-FLI1 crosstalk is involved in immune and stromal remodeling, positioning FLI1 as both a marker of tumor aggressiveness and a potential predictor of response to epigenetic therapies in breast cancer.",

Identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets is crucial to improving patient prognosis. Sortilin-related VPS10 domain-containing receptor 2 (SORCS2) regulates various biological processes and is implicated in carcinogenesis, yet its specific role in OC remains unclear. Multiple bio-informatics analyses were used to analyze SORCS2 expression and potential role in OC. Cell proliferation, migration assays and flow cytometry were performed to assess the effects of SORCS2 on OC cells. Further, Xenograft mouse models were built to identify its function in OC cell growth in vivo. In this study, we first identified that SORCS2 expression is down-regulated in OC tissues, correlating with adverse clinical characteristics and poor clinical outcomes, emphasizing its potential as a prognostic marker for OC. In vitro, SORCS2 over-expression suppressed cell proliferation and migration, induced cell cycle arrest at the S/G2 phase via the p21/CCNA1 pathway, and induced apoptosis by regulating PIDD1 and CASP9. Xenograft mouse models further validated the tumor-suppressive effects of SORCS2 in vivo. Additionally, SORCS2 was found to participate in tumor-specific immune responses by promoting T cell activation and release of immune factors. Our findings underscore SORCS2 as a tumor suppressor in OC development and highlight its potential as a prognostic marker for OC.

          "abstract": "Protein-folding chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) buffers genetic variation in diverse organisms, but the clinical significance of HSP90 buffering in human disease remains unclear. Here, we show that HSP90 buffers mutations in the BRCT domain of BRCA1. HSP90-buffered BRCA1 mutations result in protein variants that retain interactions with partner proteins and strongly rely on HSP90 for protein stability and function in cell survival. Moreover, HSP90-buffered BRCA1 variants confer poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor resistance in cancer cells. Low-level HSP90 inhibition overcomes this resistance, revealing a cryptic and mutant-specific HSP90-contingent synthetic lethality. Furthermore, by stabilizing metastable variants across the entirety of the BRCT domain, HSP90 reduces the clinical severity of BRCA1 mutations, allowing them to accumulate in populations. We estimate that HSP90 buffers 18% of known human BRCA1-BRCT missense mutations. Our work extends the clinical significance of HSP90 buffering to a prevalent class of variations in BRCA1, pioneering its importance in therapy resistance and cancer predisposition.",

          "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant clinical challenge. Immunotherapy against programmed cell death 1 protein (PD-1) in CRC has limited success. Intriguingly, CRC cells express PD-1 (ciPD-1) intrinsically, and we report here its function with respect to chemotherapy. We evaluated the associations between ciPD-1 expression and disease progression, overall survival, and upregulation of survival pathways in human CRC tumors. Expression levels of ciPD-1 in CRC cells were modulated to evaluate its biological role in vitro. High expression levels of PD-1 in CRC tumors are associated with inferior outcomes; these tumors are also more aggressive and drug-resistant. Expression levels of ciPD-1 in CRC cells increase during 5-FU or CPT-11 treatment and are accompanied by upregulation of cell survival pathways. When ciPD-1 is inhibited, the cell-killing effects of 5-FU or CPT-11 were significantly increased. Our data show that ciPD-1 signaling occurs via MAPK signaling in CRC cells to support survival under stress conditions. CRC tumors with high levels of ciPD-1 are more aggressive and associated with inferior outcomes. Reducing ciPD-1 levels in CRC cells make them more sensitive to chemotherapy. The aggregate results suggest that using a PD-1 inhibitor with first-line treatments in CRC could improve therapeutic efficacy. Proposed biological role of ciPD-1 in CRC cells. After exposure to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or nutrient deprivation, ciPD-1 expression is elevated in CRC cells. Subsequently, ciPD-1 activates MAPK and AKT signaling pathways to increase proliferation and differentiation, resulting in drug resistance and tumor growth in CRC cells. The administration of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy with chemotherapy in CRC cells could abrogate ciPD-1 activity and enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy to overcome resistance.",

          "abstract": "Colon Adenocarcinoma (COAD) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with a rising incidence. Apoptosis is a key contributor to cancer, serving as a prognostic and diagnostic marker. BID, as a link between extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways, may play an important role in COAD development. A systematic review was conducted to assess the role of the BID gene in COAD. A systematic review was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus up to December 14, 2023. Two reviewers screened articles according to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, and the risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023455350). A pan-cancer analysis of BID was performed using TCGA and HPA data. In COAD, BID expression, methylation, isoforms, and correlations with immune cell infiltration were analyzed in conjunction with clinical data. miRNAs regulating BID were investigated, and gene set enrichment analysis identified associated GO terms and KEGG pathways. Phylogenetic analysis of BID isoforms and variants was conducted using sequences from GenBank and Ensembl, aligned with Clustal Omega and NCBI tools to assess conservation and similarity. From\u00a0661 articles\u00a0identified across PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus,\u00a0205 studies\u00a0were included in the review, of which\u00a017 human studies\u00a0analyzed BID in COAD. BID mediates apoptosis in COAD through the Fas/FasL and Apo2/TRAIL pathways, activating DR4 and DR5, which leads to the recruitment of FADD and the activation of CASP-8 and CASP-10. CASP-8 cleaves BID into tBID, which activates BAX and BAK, causing mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, cytochrome c release, apoptosome formation, CASP-9 activation, and apoptosis. Apoptosis is modulated by ER stress/UPR, DPP3/CDK1, PIDD/CASP-2, NF-\u03baB/Nur77, APPL/DCC, PI3K/AKT, HIF-1, and miR-20, MCL-1, BCL-2/BCL-xL. In COAD, BID is overexpressed, particularly in isoforms BID-L, BID-EL, and BID-S, whereas BID-Si6 remains unchanged. BID expression is lower in patients with advanced-stage and N2 disease, suggesting potential prognostic value. BID expression inversely correlates with the infiltration of B cells, CD4+ T cells, and regulatory T cells. The hsa-miR-194-3p and hsa-miR-149-5p were found to be correlated with BID expression in COAD. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that BID is evolutionarily conserved, underscoring its functional importance. BID, specifically the BID-EL isoform, serves as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker in COAD, highlighting the need for further research on its potential as a therapeutic target in this disease.",

These complexes exist in distinct forms, including the polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF) complex, defined by the ARID2 subunit. ARID2 is frequently mutated in B cell leukemias, but its role in normal B cell development remains unknown. Using conditional knockout mice, we show that Arid2 deletion impairs B cell differentiation <i>in vivo</i>. Mb1-Cre-mediated deletion, active in early progenitors, caused a marked reduction of splenic and circulating Follicular B cells, whereas CD19-Cre deletion produced a milder phenotype. These defects were not due to altered proliferation or survival but reflected impaired differentiation potential. Transcriptomic profiling of isolated pro-B, pre-B, and Follicular B cells revealed that Arid2 loss disrupts stage-specific gene expression programs, with cumulative downregulation of B cell receptor signaling and altered lineage-specifying pathways. Functionally, Arid2-deficient mice exhibited impaired germinal center expansion after immunization and reduced IgG antibody production following transplantation. Together, these findings identify Arid2 as a critical regulator of B cell differentiation and maturation by coordinating transcriptional programs during early lymphopoiesis.",

Molecular alterations play a critical role in both the differential diagnosis of cancer and in the development of targeted therapies. Studies have identified the same potentially targetable mutations across various tumor types, supporting the emergence of tumor-agnostic therapies. To date, five biomarkers have been approved for tumor-agnostic therapy: microsatellite instability (MSI), neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (<i>NTRK</i>) fusion, tumor mutation burden (TMB), <i>BRAF</i> V600E mutation, and rearranged during transfection (<i>RET</i>) fusions. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved pembrolizumab for MSI-high tumors or tumors with a high TMB. Larotrectinib and entrectinib have been approved for the treatment of <i>NTRK</i> gene fusion-positive tumors. Additionally, the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib has been approved for <i>BRAF</i> V600E mutations, and selpercatinib has been approved for <i>RET</i> fusion-positive cancers as of 2022. Positive responses to agnostic therapy, a significant milestone in cancer treatment, depend on the identification of new agnostic biomarkers. Ongoing research is focused on defining additional molecular changes, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (<i>KRAS</i>), neuregulin 1 (<i>NRG1</i>), fibroblast growth factor receptor (<i>FGFR</i>), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (<i>ALK</i>), AKT serine/threonine kinase (<i>AKT</i>), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (<i>HER2</i>), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (<i>PIK3CA</i>), and breast cancer gene (<i>BRCA</i>), as potential agnostic biomarkers in various cancer types.",

          "abstract": "p190A has been studied across various cancer types, and mutation rates of up to 20% were observed in some cancers, supporting the significance of p190A in carcinogenesis. Since the relevance of p190A in bladder cancer has not been addressed so far, we attempted to explore it. Evaluation of TCGA high-throughput sequencing datasets revealed p190A mutations in up to 8% of bladder cancer samples across several studies. Employing immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray that included 202 BC patient samples, we observed that lower p190A expression correlates with increased invasiveness and poorer survival outcomes. These findings suggested that p190A may have a tumor suppressor function in bladder tissue, consistent with its anticipated function in ploidy-control. p190A knockdown resulted in chromosomal instability in ureter-derived epithelial cells with otherwise normal karyotype, supporting its potential involvement in tumorigenesis. Loss-of-function studies in low-invasive bladder RT4 cell line and gain-of-function experiments in two highly invasive bladder cancer cell lines (T24 and BFTC) demonstrated that p190A influences cell migration and invasion in vitro, as determined by scratch assay and Boyden chamber approaches. This conclusion was further validated by ex vivo porcine bladder invasion approach, invadopodia formation, and gelatin degradation assays. Pathway analysis revealed that altered p190A expression influences both the Rho-ROCK-dependent LIMK1-cofilin pathway and the phosphorylation of cortactin by focal adhesion kinase, both of which regulate critical cellular processes such as actin network organization and polarization to facilitate efficient, coordinated cell migration and division. In summary, our results indicate that p190A has a genuine role in controlling cell-ploidy and regulates actin dynamics in the bladder urothelium, while loss of p190A results in genome instability and drives bladder cancer initiation and progression through deregulated actin dynamics.",

This study investigated sex-based differences in somatic mutations, copy number alterations (CNAs), and overall survival (OS) across 34,782 patients from three global pan-cancer cohorts (TCGA, MSK MetTropism, and China OrigiMed), excluding reproductive cancers to minimize confounders. Sex-specific genetic alterations were assessed using Fisher's exact test, while OS differences were evaluated with Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Incidence patterns revealed a strong male predominance in esophageal, liver, bladder, and head and neck cancers, whereas thyroid and gallbladder cancers were more common in females. OS analysis showed a consistent female advantage in both primary and metastatic cohorts, with males experiencing poorer OS in lung adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, although colorectal cancer with hepatic metastases favored males. Mutational profiling revealed that the TP53, CDKN2A, and TTN mutations were more frequent in males, while EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations occurred more often in females. Notably, BRAF and EGFR mutations were associated with better survival in females. CNAs analysis demonstrated male-biased amplifications, including CCND1 and the FGF cluster in the China cohort, and MYC, CCND1, and ERBB2 in the TCGA and MSK cohorts. In contrast, MDM2 amplification was enriched in females in the China cohort. These findings highlight both shared and population-specific molecular differences and underscore the importance of integrating sex as a biological variable in cancer genomics, biomarker development, and clinical trial design.",

Our study revealed that FADD is overexpressed in LUSC patients, correlating with lower survival rates. We also discovered that long-term cisplatin-resistant LUSC cell lines (LUSC-CR) had elevated FADD protein levels, and reducing FADD restored their cisplatin sensitivity. At the same time, LUSC-CR cells resisted cisplatin-induced DNA damage and had enhanced DNA repair, linked to P53's negative regulation of FADD. Additionally, knockdown of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) PPFIA1-AS1 can potentiate drug resistance in LUSC cells by decelerating FADD protein turnover and elevating FADD protein levels. In essence, this study elucidated novel mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance in LUSC, wherein the PPFIA1-AS1/FADD axis regulates DNA damage and repair. Consequently, targeting the PPFIA1-AS1/FADD axis may present a promising avenue for overcoming cisplatin resistance and enhancing the prognosis of LUSC patients.",

The results showed that HTR7 is highly expressed in 12 tumors and lowly expressed in 13 tumors compared with normal tissues. HTR7 has a specific diagnostic value in 18 cancers, especially in COAD, HNSC, KIRC, PCPG, and READ. High expression of HTR7 was associated with a favorable prognosis in ACC, COAD, KIRC, KIRP, PRAD, READ, SKCM, and THCA, while in CESC, ESCA, GBM, HNSC, PAAD, and THYM, high expression of HTR7 was associated with an unfavorable prognosis. In most tumors, HTR7 expression was positively correlated with the infiltration of monocytes, macrophages, and myeloid dendritic cells and negatively correlated with Th1 infiltration. We found that HTR7 expression was positively correlated with CD274, CTLA-4, HAVCR2, PDCD1, PDCD1LG2, and TIGIT in numerous tumors. Furthermore, our study showed that aberrant methylation of HTR7 was associated with the infiltration of many immune cells, including Th1, Th17, DC, macrophages, etc. In cancer pathways, HTR7 could inhibit the cell cycle, DNA damage, and hormone AR pathways and activate the EMT and RAS/MAPK pathways. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that HTR7 could participate in the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, serotonin receptor signaling pathway, hormone signaling, cAMP signaling pathway, etc. Several drugs, including 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, sunitinib, tipifarnib, and trametinib, may be sensitive to high HTR7 expression in tumors.",

The ssDNA-binding protein complex CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) plays a pivotal role in maintaining genome stability by countering replication stress, modulating DNA damage repair, and maintaining telomere integrity. Despite its well-documented role in genome maintenance, the involvement of CST in skin cancer development has yet to be investigated. We recently found that CST localizes at stalled DNA replication sites after UV exposure and may suppress the unwanted repriming activity, suggesting a potential role of CST in suppressing genome instability caused by UV damage. In this study, we first analyzed CST expression and alterations in cutaneous melanoma database and found that the CST genes are frequently altered in cutaneous melanoma and their expression is significantly downregulated in melanoma samples compared to normal tissues. We then generated a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model with STN1 deficiency specifically in melanocytes to investigate its role in skin cancer formation. Upon chronic exposure to UV irradiation, STN1-deficient mice exhibit no obvious difference in melanoma incidence compared to control littermates, suggesting that STN1 downregulation in mature melanocytes has no significant effect on UV-induced skin cancer development in lab mice.",

          "abstract": "Colon cancer is a common disease, treated with few chemotherapeutic agents with similar treatment sequencing despite its heterogeneity. A significant proportion of patients are diagnosed with metastasis, and resistance to antineoplastic drugs is associated with disease progression and therapeutic failure. It is known that the tumor microenvironment plays an essential role in cancer progression, contributing to processes that may be associated with therapeutic resistance mechanisms in colon cancer. In this study, we aim to identify a gene expression signature and its relationship with immune cell infiltration in colon cancer, contributing to the identification of potential resistance biomarkers. An <i>in silico</i> study was conducted using RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) samples, subdivided into two groups (treatment-resistant and non-resistant), taking into account the molecular subgroups (CMS1, CMS2, CMS3, and CMS4). The following algorithms were used: i. <i>Limma</i> was applied to identify differentially expressed genes; ii. WGCNA was applied to construct co-expression networks; iii. CIBERSORT was applied to estimate the proportion of infiltrating immune cells; and iv. TIMER was applied to explore the relationship between core genes and immune cell content. Twenty differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found, with 18 related to the group considered resistant to oncologic treatment and presenting poorer overall survival. T CD4 memory resting cells and M0 and M2 macrophages were found in more significant proportions in the analyzed samples and more infiltrated in the tumor microenvironment, the higher the expression of some of these resistance DEGs. Additionally, these genes correlate with biological aspects of neuronal differentiation, axogenesis, and synaptic transmission. The gene expression signature suggests the presence of differentially expressed synaptic membrane genes, which may be involved in neuronal pathways that influence the tumor microenvironment, potentially serving as future biomarkers. Furthermore, the presence of M0 and M2 macrophages and T CD4 memory resting cells suggests a potential interaction that may play a role in therapeutic resistance.",

However, many existing models have limited capacity to capture cross-omics feature interactions, which hinders the depth of integration. In this study, we introduce SynOmics, a graph convolutional network framework designed to improve multi-omics integration by constructing omics networks in the feature space and modeling both within- and cross-omics dependencies. By incorporating both omics-specific networks and cross-omics bipartite networks, SynOmics enables simultaneous learning of intra-omics and inter-omics relationships. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on early or late integration strategies, SynOmics adopts a parallel learning strategy to process feature-level interactions at each layer of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that SynOmics consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multi-omics integration methods across a range of biomedical classification tasks, highlighting its potential for biomarker discovery and clinical applications.",

We focused on <i>ADIPOQ, GAS5, GATA4</i>, and <i>YAP1</i>, which are known for their roles in key molecular pathways related to tumorigenesis, such as adipokine signaling, lncRNA regulation, transcriptional control, and Hippo signaling, but have not been sufficiently explored in the context of epigenetic regulation in breast cancer. Using the methylospecific PCR (MSP) method, we analyzed the methylation of the four genes in the tumor tissues collected from 57 TNBC patients. We evaluated their association with response to neoadjuvant treatment and clinicopathological characteristics. Additionally, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of methylation and expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) TNBC cohort to explore their relationships with overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), disease-free interval (DFI), progression-free interval (PFI), and relapse-free survival (RFS). No significant associations were observed between methylation patterns and clinicopathological characteristics in the patients. However, in silico analysis of the TNBC cohort identified <i>ADIPOQ</i> methylation as having the most significant associations, correlating with all five survival endpoints, including OS, DSS, DFI, PFI, and RFS. <i>GAS5</i> methylation was significantly associated with OS, DSS, and RFS, and <i>GATA4</i> methylation showed significant associations with PFI, whereas <i>YAP1</i> methylation was significantly associated with OS and RFS. In addition, <i>GAS5</i> expression was linked to DSS, DFI and RFS. This study highlights the potential prognostic significance of the epigenetic regulation of <i>ADIPOQ</i> in TNBC. The in silico findings shed light on the molecular pathways associated with TNBC progression and warrant further investigation to validate their role in clinical outcomes and underlying biological mechanisms.",

Early diagnosis is crucial for effective intervention, yet current methods lack robust solutions to overcome this challenge. The Pan-Cancer Atlas has emerged as a pivotal framework to investigate cancer heterogeneity by integrating multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) across tumor types. This initiative systematically maps inter- and intratumor variations, providing insight for clinical decision making. However, such frameworks often struggle to integrate dynamic temporal changes and spatial heterogeneity within tumors, limiting their real-time clinical applicability. In this review, we first summarize the available multi-omics data and public biomedical databases used in pan-cancer research. Then, we examine current pan-cancer classification approaches based on the computational models they employed, including machine learning and deep learning. We also provide a comparison of these classification methods to explore their advantages and limitations. Finally, we conclude by discussing the key challenges in pan-cancer research and suggesting potential directions for future studies.",

Despite advancements in Alternative PolyAdenylation (APA) analysis using RNA-seq, detecting and quantifying novel IPA events remains challenging. To address this, we developed IPScan, a computational pipeline for precise IPA event identification, quantification, and visualization.

Here, we evaluate the impact of TMPRSS11B activity on the host immune system and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tmprss11b depletion significantly reduces tumor burden in immunocompetent mice and triggers an infiltration of immune cells.

Furthermore, utilizing ultra-pH-sensitive nanoparticle imaging and metabolite analysis, we identify regions of acidification, elevated lactate, and enrichment of immunosuppressive (M2-like) macrophages in LUSC tumors.

Identifying key immune-related regulators is essential for improving patient stratification and therapeutic outcomes. Transcriptomic data from TCGA and GEO datasets were integrated to screen IRDEGs. Functional enrichment, co-expression, and PPI network analyses were performed to explore the biological context. Consensus clustering based on hub gene expression was used to define immune-related molecular subtypes. Immune infiltration characteristics, immune checkpoint expression, TIDE and IPS scores, and predicted immunotherapy responses were compared. FCGR2A expression was validated in clinical HCC tissues by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. <i>In vitro</i> assays evaluated the effects of FCGR2A knockdown on HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. A total of 21 IRDEGs were identified, among which FCGR2A was consistently upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. Enrichment analysis indicated significant involvement in immune activation and inflammatory signaling pathways. PPI network analysis identified nine hub genes, including FCGR2A. Consensus clustering revealed two distinct immune-related molecular subtypes with marked differences in immune infiltration patterns, immune checkpoint profiles, TIDE and IPS scores. GSEA demonstrated subtype-specific activation of antigen processing, T cell signaling, and inflammatory pathways. Experimental validation confirmed elevated FCGR2A expression in HCC tissues. Functional assays showed that FCGR2A knockdown significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.

While the induction of senescence, a state of arrested cell growth, is generally achieved by available anticancer treatments, senescence can adversely promote tumorigenesis through an upheld augmented inflammatory state called senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Thus, the precise delineation of underlying regulatory mechanisms governing senescence is urgently needed. Herein, we investigated the beneficial anticancer senescence response elicited by silencing the expression of the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in TNBC, where it exerts an oncogenic role. Functional genomics studies implicated the downregulation of a specific set of ribosomal protein (RP) genes tied to poor clinical outcome. Re-introduction of RPL38 or RPL39L alone, but not RPS14, a favorable outcome-associated RP, was sufficient to block the senescence phenotype induced by PML knockdown. RP gene regulation by PML was found to involve the assembly of a previously unrecognized PML-mTOR-RONIN transcriptional complex at their promoters. Furthermore, we show that RONIN levels are elevated in TNBC and that RONIN silencing can recapitulate the senescent phenotype of PML-deficient cells. This work offers new therapeutic insights for TNBC that involve senescence-inducing therapies or senolytics.",

          "abstract": "TP53 mutant cancers are associated with approximately half of cancer deaths. The most common mechanism of p53 inactivation involves missense mutations. Such mutations in TP53 result in a robust upregulation of the p53 protein. Here, we demonstrate an induced proximity approach to selectively kill TP53 mutant cells. This approach uses the increased abundance of p53 protein in TP53 mutant cancer cells to concentrate toxic molecules in these cells. We demonstrate this approach with a molecule that binds the Y220C mutant of p53 and concentrates a PLK1 inhibitor in cells harboring TP53<sup>Y220C</sup> mutations. The resulting bifunctional molecule promotes formation of a p53<sup>Y220C</sup>-PLK1 ternary complex, mislocalizes PLK1, inhibits PLK1 activity, elicits selective G2/M arrest and induces apoptosis in TP53<sup>Y220C</sup> cells while sparing wild-type TP53 cells. These data exemplify a potentially generalizable framework for targeting TP53 missense mutations by leveraging mutant p53 protein abundance to induce cell death, independent of p53's transcriptional activity.",

          "abstract": "Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is associated with prostate cancer (PCa) development and lethality and exhibits immunosuppressive properties in other models. We investigated IGF-1's tumor-intrinsic immune effects in PCa to understand mechanisms underlying its poor immunotherapy response. Transcriptional profiling of human (DU145, 22Rv1) and murine (Myc-CaP) PCa cells revealed that IGF-1 suppresses cytokine signalling, antigen processing and presentation, and additional immune regulatory pathways. We further examined the expression of components involved in cancer cell recognition and immune evasion: the antigen processing machinery and PD-L1 checkpoint. IGF-1 downregulated key elements such as transporters associated with antigen processing (TAPs), endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase-1 (ERAP-1), and Class I \u03b22-microglobulin, without significantly altering Class I allele expression. These changes were associated with reduced surface presentation of Class I complexes on Myc-CaP cells, suggesting disrupted peptide transport, processing, and/or presentation. In contrast, IGF-1 upregulated the immune checkpoint CD274 (PD-L1) via IGF receptor/AKT/ERK-dependent signalling. Analysis of TCGA Firehose Legacy PCa data showed higher CD274 expression in tumors with elevated IGF1 and IGFBP5. Multiplex immunofluorescence in primary PCa confirmed increased PD-L1 in patients with high serum IGF-1, supporting its role in immune evasion. Overall, these findings reveal a novel IGF-1-driven immunosuppressive mechanism that may underlie PCa's resistance to immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer remains a major global health issue, requiring novel strategies for prognostic evaluation and therapeutic decision-making. In this study, we leverage multi-omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to obtain deeper insights into breast cancer biology. By integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics, we aim to identify complex molecular signatures that drive breast cancer progression and impact patient survival. To optimize the integration and feature selection process within the multi-omics dataset, we have employed genetic programming. Genetic programming helps us to optimize multi-omics integration, enabling the identification of robust biomarkers and more accurate survival analysis. The proposed framework consists of three key components: data preprocessing, adaptive integration and feature selection via genetic programming, and model development. The experimental results indicate that the integrated multi-omics approach yields a concordance index (C-index) of 78.31 during 5\u00a0fold cross-validation on the training set and 67.94 on the test set. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the potential of adaptive multi-omics integration in improving breast cancer survival analysis. It also highlights the importance of considering the complex interplay between different molecular layers. Furthermore, this framework provides a flexible and scalable approach that can be extended to other cancer types, offering valuable insights into oncological processes.",

          "abstract": "Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs), including diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs), are universally fatal pediatric brain tumors with no effective treatments. DIPG tumors actively utilize mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Inhibition of Complex I (a core OXPHOS component) by phenformin radiosensitizes DIPG in vitro and in vivo. However, phenformin\u2019s clinical application is limited by its risk of lactic acidosis. We investigated whether co-administration of the pyruvate-dehydrogenase-kinase (PDK) inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA) can mitigate phenformin-induced acidosis while enhancing its anti-tumor activity. Patient-derived DIPG cells (SU-DIPG17, HSJD-DIPG007, SU-DIPG-VI) were treated with phenformin (0.625 mM), DCA (25 mM) or both. Mitochondrial and glycolytic flux (oxygen consumption rate (OCR) / extracellular acidification rate (ECAR)), ATP production, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), cell-cycle and apoptosis were quantified alongside RNA-seq and Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS metabolomics. Hypoxia was measured in neurospheres using fluorescence. Radiosensitization was assessed by \u03b3-H2AX foci and clonogenic survival. In vivo, HSJD-DIPG007 orthotopic xenografts received phenformin (125\u00a0mg/kg/day) and DCA (250\u00a0mg/kg/day) by oral gavage for 4 weeks, alone or with focal brain-stem irradiation (2\u00a0Gy \u00d7 10); tumor immunohistochemistry and survival were recorded. DCA alone shifted glucose metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), reducing ECAR and intracellular lactate. When combined with phenformin, DCA significantly suppressed phenformin-induced glycolysis and ECAR while further reducing ATP. In vitro, this combination induced synergistic cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and ROS-induced DNA damage. Multi-omics integration revealed coordinated repression of glycolytic/ hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) programs and diversion of glucose into redox-supportive pentose-phosphate pathways. Hypoxic staining confirmed reduced hypoxia and HIF-1\u03b1 in 3D neurospheroids. The combination produced additional in vitro radiosensitization, with the phenformin\u2009+\u2009DCA\u2009+\u2009radiation triple regimen achieving the greatest \u03b3-H2AX persistence and clonogenic kill. In mice, the triple combination schedule incurred systemic toxicity, reflected from weight loss, and did not extend survival over 4 weeks treatment. DCA effectively counteracts phenformin-induced lactic acidosis in vitro yet heightens metabolic stress and radiosensitization in DIPG cells, providing proof-of-concept that a carefully chosen metabolic partner can boost tumor control. However, weight loss in vivo limited the length of treatment schedule and optimizing dose and schedule, or selecting safer mitochondrial inhibitors with PDK blockade, will be essential next steps before determining in vivo efficacy of this metabolic strategy.

This study aimed to identify molecular biomarkers that differentiate leiomyosarcomas from leiomyomas and to assess their prognostic value. We analyzed 3'RNA sequencing data from 51 leiomyosarcomas and 44 leiomyomas with differential gene expression analysis and machine learning to identify diagnostic biomarkers. We utilized immunohistochemistry to validate the findings. We used Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models to assess disease-specific survival in leiomyosarcoma patients. Leiomyosarcomas exhibited significant dysregulation of the retinoblastoma and cell cycle pathways. Clustering based on retinoblastoma pathway genes identified a subset of leiomyosarcomas with a leiomyoma-like expression profile that associated with better survival. Machine learning-based classification identified genes with high predictive accuracy, including genes from the retinoblastoma pathway. Immunohistochemistry validated TOP2A and CDK1 as potential diagnostic biomarkers, and their higher expression was associated with worse survival. Leiomyoma driver alterations were found in 27% of leiomyosarcomas, but these showed no association with survival.

Here, we identify cytidine deaminase APOBEC3B as a key driver of this process. Using a unique uracil-in-DNA probe, we show that BRCA2 loss promotes APOBEC3B-mediated uracil accumulation in single-stranded DNA (U-ssDNA) at stalled forks. These lesions when processed by UNG2 and APE1, trigger fork collapse and release ssDNA fragments into the cytoplasm, activating NF-\u03baB signaling. This in turn upregulates APOBEC3B expression, establishing a self-reinforcing loop that amplifies cytidine deamination at stalled forks and exacerbates genomic instability. Depletion of APOBEC3B, UNG2, or APE1 rescues these defects. Notably, BRCA1-deficient cells do not accumulate U-ssDNA or induce APOBEC3B under replication stress, highlighting a BRCA2-specific vulnerability. Clinically, low APE1 expression correlates with poor survival in patients with BRCA2-mutant tumors, with high APOBEC3 levels further worsening outcomes. Together, our findings establish that replication stress, whether intrinsic or therapy induced, triggers APOBEC3B overexpression and potentially activates an APOBEC3B-driven mutagenic loop in BRCA2-deficient cells. These results position APOBEC3B, UNG2 and APE1 as critical regulators of BRCA2-mutant tumor evolution and therapy resistance.",

In our laboratory, we developed a preclinical mouse model of metastatic immunodormancy. Dormant spontaneous metastases are controlled by the immune system of wild-type mice. Depletion of the host immune system causes these metastases to awaken and progress. Dormant metastases are compared with nude metastases and overt metastases that have never been in dormancy. The findings of the study indicate that the dormant metastases exhibit a unique and differentiated phenotype. This is evidenced by their varied response to nutrient-restrictive conditions, chemotherapeutic agents, and cytokines in vitro. Furthermore, dormant metastases exhibit a distinctive transcriptional pattern of gene expression, which is predominantly promoted by the Ch25h gene. Additionally, the analysis revealed differential expression of microRNAs, with elevated levels of mir-142-3p being expressed de novo. The microenvironment of dormant metastases shows an increase in T lymphocytes (cytotoxic and helper T lymphocytes and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells) and neutrophils. Immune-controlled dormant metastases exhibit a unique phenotype that can be exploited to discover new biomarkers, as well as to develop therapies to eradicate them or control overt metastases.",

Moreover, there was differential <i>NTRK1/2/3</i> expression with respect to clinicopathological and molecular/genomic indices. In addition, this study demonstrated that <i>NTRK1/2/3</i> expression was deregulated by a combination of copy number alterations (<i>NTRK2</i>), aberrant methylation (<i>NTRK1/2/3</i>) and potentially and cryptic gene fusion (<i>NTRK3</i>). Furthermore, GSEA and POEA demonstrated that <i>NTRK1/2/3</i>-high CRC subsets exhibited enrichment of and cross-talks among the NTRK signalling pathways, as well as of known cancer signalling pathways. The GSEA and DOEA showed that NTRK signalling was enriched for kinase inhibitors responses, representing evidence that <i>NTRK1/2/3</i> expression may serve as biomarkers for multiple kinase inhibitors, including entrectinib-the tissue-agnostic kinase inhibitor for cancers with NTRK gene fusions. <b>Conclusions</b>: The results demonstrated that fusion-negative NTRK signalling may be active in CRC and may contribute to the molecular pathogenesis and biology of the disease.

Bioinformatics methodologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data analysis, are essential for deciphering the complex molecular landscape of breast cancer. Bioinformatics tools facilitate the identification of differentially expressed genes, non-coding RNAs, and proteins, unraveling crucial pathways involved in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. By constructing and analyzing protein-protein interaction networks and signaling pathways, bioinformatics approaches can identify potential diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. Herein, we explore the role of bioinformatics in breast cancer research and its potential application in identifying novel therapeutic targets and predicting drug response, ultimately enabling the development of tailored treatment strategies.

          "abstract": "Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality globally, driven by complex molecular mechanisms and characterized by significant biological heterogeneity across cancer types. We aimed to discover mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) family members as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets in different cancer types. MAPKs are key signaling molecules regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, stress response, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of MAPK pathways has been implicated in the onset and progression of multiple cancers, contributing to tumor growth, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Given their diverse roles across cancer types, systematic analysis of MAPK gene expression, mutations, and interactions with tumor microenvironment is essential. The present study undertakes a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of MAPKs in nine major cancer types using RNA-Seq datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). RNA-Seq data were analyzed to identify differentially expressed MAPKs across nine cancer types using DESeq2, NOIseq, and limma. Significant genes (adjusted <i>p</i><0.05) were subjected to GO and KEGG enrichment (EnrichR), mutational profiling (cBioPortal), and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Tumor immune infiltration was further assessed using TIMER2.0 to explore immune-gene interactions. Through rigorous differential expression analysis, we identified key MAPKs that are significantly altered in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Specifically, six MAPKs (MAPK3, MAPK7, MAPK9, MAPK10, MAPK12, and MAPK13) were found to be differentially expressed in LIHC, while MAPK6 emerged as the sole significant candidate in LUAD. Functional enrichment and pathway analysis revealed that these MAPKs are involved in critical oncogenic pathways, including MAPK-mediated transcriptional regulation and stress-activated signaling cascades. Mutational profiling and survival analysis further validated the prognostic significance of these genes, with several MAPKs showing strong associations with reduced patient survival. Tumor immune infiltration analysis indicated potential roles of these MAPKs in modulating immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. Also, MAPKs identified in this study are structurally related, suggesting that targeting them collectively may enhance therapeutic efficacy and overcome resistance mechanisms. Our integrated approach underscores the value of MAPK family members as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets in LIHC and LUAD. This study contributes important insights into MAPK-related oncogenic processes and supports the development of targeted therapies under the framework of precision oncology.",

However, its diagnostic and prognostic roles, as well as its impact on immune regulation in different cancers, remain unclear. This study utilized public databases like TCGA and GEO to analyze CLIC6 expression, diagnostic value, and prognostic significance across various cancers. It examined genetic and epigenetic variations, immune correlations, and performed functional enrichment analysis to uncover CLIC6-related pathways. Western blotting confirmed CLIC6 protein levels in breast cancer samples, while CCK-8, colony formation, transwell, and scratch assays evaluated its role in cell proliferation and migration. Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry further validated CLIC6 expression in breast cancer. Research shows that CLIC6 expression is typically lower in most cancers compared to normal tissues, with distinct patterns across different stages. It serves as a useful diagnostic marker and potential prognostic factor for BRCA, LUAD, STAD, and LGG. CLIC6 mutations are common in many cancers and affect prognosis. In most tumors, CLIC6 expression correlates with m6A methylation, and its promoter is highly methylated. In BRCA, the expression of CLIC6 is related to bacterial defense, immune response, endopeptidase regulation, neuropeptide signaling, and amino acid transport. It is expressed at low levels in BRCA tissues, and we speculate that a higher CLIC6 expression may be protective. In conclusion, CLIC6 can serve as a key biomarker for various cancers, and its expression level is related to the tumor immune microenvironment and the outcomes in selected cancers; further validation is warranted. Our research on CLIC6 in BRCA has revealed new potential for tumor treatment strategies targeting this marker.",

These tumor-like lesions can cause symptoms like abnormal uterine bleeding and infertility, and they may undergo malignant transformation. The etiology of endometrial polyps remains largely unknown. Here, we conducted whole-genome sequencing and global gene expression profiling on 23 polyps. Major findings were validated with targeted DNA (Sanger sequencing) and protein (immunohistochemistry) level analyses. Sanger sequencing was also utilized to validate the observed novel alterations in an additional set of 54 polyp samples. The most common alterations were chromosomal rearrangements affecting HMGA1 and HMGA2, identified in 74% (17/23) of the polyps. These rearrangements involved LRMDA, RAD51B, TRAF3IP2, and 7p15.2 as recurrent rearrangement partners. 3'RNA sequencing indicated corresponding overexpression of HMGA1 and HMGA2 as well as a downstream target PLAG1. Elevated protein level expression of HMGA1 and HMGA2 was further shown using immunohistochemistry. In addition to frequent HMGA1 and HMGA2 alterations, we found UBE2A as a novel candidate driver gene with highly specific recurrent mutations. We also identified recurrent low-allelic fraction mutations in well-established cancer genes KRAS, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, and PTEN. Here, we have characterized the genomic landscape of endometrial polyps. We show that chromosomal alterations affecting HMGA1 and HMGA2 are a major underlying cause for polyp development. In addition, we present UBE2A as a novel candidate gene for human tumorigenesis. Our results contribute to a better understanding of endometrial polyp development and pave the way towards the development of targeted, non-invasive treatment options.",

Furthermore, we found its key transcriptional target ZC3HC1 via ChIP \u2013 seq analysis, ChIP - qPCR and luciferase assay. Notably, DLX4 has strong potential for liquid - liquid phase separation and likely forms condensates when binding to ZC3HC1\u2019s promoter, a crucial cell - cycle regulator. Overall, DLX4 is a novel prognostic biomarker and suggests potential CRC therapeutic strategies, making significant contributions to the understanding and potential treatment of CRC at the molecular level.

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma, IDH wild-type (WHO grade 4) (GBM), is the most common primary brain tumor in adults with a 21-month median overall survival, despite surgical-resection and radio-chemotherapy. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody towards vascular endothelial growth factor-A, is used to treat recurrent-GBM. To find predictors of poor-response, patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-tumors were treated with bevacizumab or vehicle and subsequently grouped based on survival-response; RNAseq expression was then compared by responder-status. Bioinformatic-analysis demonstrated differential gene expression in tumors from poor-responders (six-PDXs) as compared to tumors from good-responders (three-PDXs), along with upregulation of angiogenesis and collagen gene-sets in poor-responders. Within these gene-sets, multiple genes known to be regulated by the early growth response-1 (EGR1) transcription factor, which was also upregulated, were identified and CHRNA7 (\u03b17-nicotinic-acetylcholine receptor, \u03b17-nAChR) was selected for validation. In terms of protein/functional studies, in the bevacizumab-treated poor-responders, nuclear-EGR1 was elevated, Ki67-labeling was increased in EGR1<sup>high</sup> tumor, and there was increased angiogenesis. Expression of \u03b17-nAChR and nuclear EGR1 was directly correlated, suggesting CHRNA7 is an EGR1 downstream target. Data-mining (GLASS-database) showed that recurrent GBM in females with an elevated EGR1 and methylated MGMT promoter had a shorter survival. In summary, GBM with increased EGR1 expression, Ki67-labeling in EGR1<sup>high</sup> tumor and angiogenesis demonstrated a poor-response to bevacizumab, suggesting EGR1 could be useful in predicting response.",

A comprehensive analysis examining the discrepancies in expression levels, survival outcomes, immune cell infiltration (ICI), and enrichment profiles was performed. The expression of CORO1A in breast cancer tissues was verified by immunohistochemistry, WB and RT-qPCR experiments. The effects of different expression levels of CORO1A on the growth and metastasis of breast cancer cell lines were verified by CCK-8, colony formation, Trasnwell and cell scratch experiments. The findings revealed a heightened expression of CORO1A in the 66.7% of tumor types (22/33), CORO1A consistently demonstrates high diagnostic potential and variable prognostic significance across cancers. In particular, its diagnostic value in SKCM reaches as high as 98%, with a prognostic hazard ratio of 0.77. CORO1A often characterized by hypomethylation of its promoter region, which correlates with the ICI level. Enrichment analysis highlights the critical contribution of CORO1A in B cell receptor pathways and other immune-linked processes, CORO1A may have multiple potential roles in B-cell receptor pathways, involving aspects such as signal transduction regulation, cytoskeletal remodeling and migration, as well as interactions with other immune molecules. exerting a substantial influence on patient prognosis. CORO1A is highly expressed in breast cancer tissues. Breast cancer patients with high expression of CORO1A have a good prognosis. CORO1A knockdown inhibits the growth and metastasis of breast cancer cells, while overexpression is the opposite. Therefore, due to its high diagnostic sensitivity and prognostic value demonstrated in various cancers, CORO1A holds promise as a candidate molecule for novel targeted therapies.

          "abstract": "Fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma (FH-deficient RCC) is a rare, aggressive malignancy with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. Despite immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) showing efficacy in other cancers, responses in FH-deficient RCC remain suboptimal. Metabolic remodeling, particularly the Warburg effect-driven glycolysis, is implicated in immune evasion and tumor progression, highlighting the need for predictive biomarkers and combinatorial strategies. We integrated 41 single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) datasets (19 malignancies, 405 patients, 1,220,365 cells) to develop a glycolytic signature (Glyc.Sig). Validation included pan-cancer transcriptomic analysis (30 cancer types, n=10,154), CRISPR screening data (4 cancers), and clinical immunotherapy cohorts (5 cancers, n=921). LDHA was identified as a top-ranked immune-resistant candidate through CRISPR screening analysis, validated via immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry in Renji Hospital cohorts. Glyc.Sig exhibited a robust inverse correlation between glycolytic activity and ICI efficacy across malignancies. It outperformed conventional biomarkers in predicting immunotherapy outcomes. CRISPR screening prioritized LDHA, a key glycolytic enzyme, as a target to enhance ICI response. Clinical validation confirmed elevated LDHA expression in FH-deficient RCC tumor tissues, which may correlate with immunosuppressive microenvironments and resistance to ICIs. Combinatorial LDHA inhibition and ICI treatment may demonstrate synergistic antitumor effects. This study establishes Glyc.Sig as a dual diagnostic-predictive biomarker system, linking glycolytic reprogramming to immune evasion. Comparative validation revealed its enhanced predictive capacity for ICI responsiveness relative to existing molecular signatures. LDHA inhibition emerges as a promising strategy to overcome ICI resistance in FH-deficient RCC and other glycolytic tumors. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting cancer metabolism to optimize immunotherapy efficacy.",

          "abstract": "Characterizing tumor-associated gene expression variations in breast cancer is crucial for identifying molecular drivers and therapeutic targets, thereby advancing precision strategies for early detection, prognosis, and treatment optimization. This study aimed to investigate the oncogenic role of death-associated protein-like 1 (DAPL1) in breast cancer. We employed a bioinformatics approach to conduct a comprehensive analysis of DAPL1, including DNA methylation, genetic alterations, kinase analysis, immune cell infiltration, and signaling pathways. The breast cancer datasets from TCGA (the cancer genome atlas) and GEO (gene expression omnibus) were utilized. DAPL1 is lowly expressed in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. In the TCGA-BRCA (breast invasive carcinoma) cohort, we observed a correlation between low expression of <i>DAPL1</i> and poor clinical prognosis regarding overall survival. Based on the survival data of GEO, the low <i>DAPL1</i> expression was associated with a poor prognosis of distant metastasis-free and relapse-free survival. Furthermore, <i>DAPL1</i> expression was linked to the mutation status or copy number variation of several genes, such as <i>MAP3K1</i> (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1), <i>NUP98</i> (nucleoporin 98), and <i>CCDC59</i> (coiled-coil domain containing 59). The infiltration level of immune cells (e.g., M1 macrophage, B cells, etc.) may be involved in the etiology of breast cancer. Based on the DAPL1-correlated genes, enrichment analysis data indicated the association between <i>DAPL1</i> expression and a series of biological issues, such as ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Additionally, there were several potential DAPL1-associated phosphorylation kinases, including CDC2 (cell division cycle 2), MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases), and PKA (protein kinase A). DAPL1 has been recognized as a prognostic biomarker in breast cancer. The molecular mechanisms may involve protein phosphorylation, immune cell infiltration, and several biological issues, especially protein ubiquitination.",

This study is ongoing, and we report results from the dose escalation and non-prespecified interim efficacy results of the expansion cohorts for which recruitment is ongoing. Dose escalation (n = 85) and expansion (n = 87) cohorts included 172 patients (135 mesothelioma). VT3989 exhibited a favorable safety profile with mostly grade 1-2 toxicities, including increased urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR), proteinuria, peripheral edema and fatigue. Proteinuria was reversible with dose adjustment and did not result in renal impairment. The overall response rate (ORR) was 26% in 47 patients with mesothelioma treated at clinically optimized doses, whereas the ORR was 32% (disease control rate 86%; median progression-free survival 10\u2009months) in 22 patients with mesothelioma when clinically optimized doses and UACR thresholds were incorporated. These data provide the first early clinical proof of concept for effectively drugging the Hippo-YAP-TEAD pathway.

          "abstract": "The Rac1 P29S hotspot mutation in cutaneous melanoma is associated with resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors (MAPKi) and worse clinical outcomes. Moreover, activation of Rac1 guanine exchange factors (GEFs) also promotes MAPKi-resistance, particularly in undifferentiated melanoma cells. Here we delineate mechanisms of Rac1-driven MAPKi-resistance and identify strategies to inhibit the growth of this class of cutaneous melanomas. We find that Rac1-driven melanomas manifest pleiotropic resistance mechanisms including (i) reduced dependence on BRAF/MEK, (ii) activation of alternative MAPK pathways utilizing Jun kinase and p38 MAP kinase, and (iii) a partial reliance on YAP/TAZ signaling. Importantly, although Rac1-driven melanoma cells display reduced dependence on BRAF/MEK, they are not completely ERK-independent. Additionally, the presence of activated Rac1 appears to create a dependency on focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling in undifferentiated melanoma cells. Therefore, despite the pleiotropic mechanisms of Rac1-driven MAPKi resistance, we find that combined inhibition of RAF and MEK with the RAF/MEK clamp avutometinib and FAK with the FAK inhibitor defactinib is a promising approach for suppressing the growth of Rac1-driven melanoma cells. Thus, the avutometinib plus defactinib combination, which is currently being investigated for brain metastatic cutaneous melanoma may also have utility against Rac1-driven MAPKi-resistance in heavily pre-treated, advanced disease.",

          "abstract": "Biliary carcinomas are aggressive cancers with a high mortality rate. When metastatic, biliary cancers are associated with a short survival and low response to treatments. The first line therapy of metastatic biliary carcinomas consists of a platinum doublet chemotherapy combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and results in a median overall survival in the range of approximately 12-13 months, with 20% to 25% of patients surviving at 2 years. Second line chemotherapy options based on fluoropyrimidines are associated with a median survival of less than 6 months. Genomic studies in recent years have clarified molecular aspects of biliary cancers and have confirmed the molecular heterogeneity between the intrahepatic, extrahepatic and gallbladder primary sites. Publicly available genomic cohorts of biliary cancer primary locations were interrogated for common mutations and copy number alterations with a focus on receptor tyrosine kinases and their signal transduction pathways. Specific mutations and structural alterations have different prevalence depending on the primary location. Alterations in receptor tyrosine kinases and the transduction pathways originating from them show differential prevalence in the primary locations of the biliary cancers and create diverse treatment opportunities that can be harnessed for drug development. Approximately 49% of intrahepatic, 57.6% of gallbladder, and 66% of extrahepatic carcinomas harbor RTK pathway alterations. Targeted therapies for individual components of these kinase receptors and pathways, including FGFR2, HER2, BRAF and others, have already been introduced in clinical practice for the treatment of patients with biliary tumors bearing alterations in these genes. The findings underscore the need for primary site-driven genomic testing to guide therapy selection. The current analysis discusses strategies to create opportunities for clinically available targeted therapies.",

While protein-coding genes are known to contribute to disease pathogenesis, their specific roles require further investigation. We analyzed RNA-seq and clinical data from 179 PAAD patients in TCGA to examine TICRR (TOPBP1 Interacting Checkpoint And Replication Regulator). Prognostic analyses included survival and risk assessment. Complementary cell-based experiments explored TICRR and associated non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Multi-omics profiling examined potential relationships between TICRR expression and tumor microenvironment features. Higher TICRR expression showed association with poorer survival outcomes. Experimental modulation of MIR659 and AC074099.1 expression appeared to influence malignant phenotypes in vitro. Multi-omics data suggested potential links between TICRR-associated molecular changes and features of immune evasion and genomic instability. Our findings suggest possible connections between TICRR expression and PAAD progression. The observed phenotypic changes following ncRNA modulation may indicate their involvement in related oncogenic processes.

Nevertheless, previous studies have shown that some MSS CRCs are sensitive to ICIs, although established criteria for treatment justification are still lacking. This study aimed to test the tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) features of MSS and develop a novel computational tool for the similarity prediction between MSS and MSI-H status in patients with CRC based on multiple factors. We collected and analyzed data from 188 patients with CRC, including MSI status, immune cell distributions, clinical features, and gene mutations, using statistical methods and Cox regression. An ensemble machine learning-based MSI-H score was developed using stacked extreme gradient boosting classifiers to quantify the similarity of patient data to MSI-H data based on immune cell distributions, clinical features, and gene mutations. The model was robust and could address missing input data for immune cell distributions and gene mutations. The scorer performed well (mean Cohen \u03ba of 0.40, SD 0.05, over 10 random seeds) in identifying MSI-H-like MSS samples with TIL distributions similar to genuine MSI-H CRCs. No significant difference was observed between the TIL features of MSI-H-like MSS CRCs and MSI-H CRCs. The disparity between MSI-H-like MSS CRCs and MSS CRCs potentially lies in the T regulatory cells (P=.09) and macrophage (P=.16) populations within the tumor stromal region. Some patients with MSS CRC presented similar immune cell distributions with high immunoactivity compared to patients with MSI-H CRC. The MSI-H score serves as a metric to quantify the similarity of MSS CRCs to MSI-H CRCs and presents a promising avenue for more personalized and effective cancer immunotherapy treatment, offering a clinical reference for potential ICI targets in MSS CRCs.",

On the other hand, recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have greatly contributed to cancer genome research. In this research, using RNA sequence data of HNSCC stored in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs), functionally enriched gene sets, and new prognostic markers or candidate therapeutic targets. This exploratory study investigated whether novel prognostic markers and candidate therapeutic targets for HNSCC could be identified from TCGA RNA-seq data. Methods The RNA sequence data were downloaded from TCGA, including 504 cases from cancer and 44 cases from corresponding normal tissue. The DEGs between cancer and normal samples were detected using the DESeq2 package in R software. Differences with | log2 fold change (FC) | > 1.0 and p-value <0.05 were considered as DEGs. Functional enrichment analyses were performed by ShinyGO 0.85 with Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. A gene set enrichment analysis\u00a0(GSEA) was also performed using GSEA software. We also analyzed the top 10 up- and down-regulated genes, which were sorted by adjusted p-value, by using Kaplan-Meier analysis to assess their potential as prognostic markers. Results Using the DESeq2 package, 10,976 DEGs were detected, including 6,932 up-regulated genes and 4,044 down-regulated genes in cancer. As expected, functional enrichment analyses revealed enrichment of KEGG terms associated with cancers, including \"Pathway in Cancer\", \"Human Papillomavirus infection\", and \"PI3K-Akt signaling pathway\" in up-regulated genes, whereas KEGG terms enriched in down-regulated genes were mainly \"Metabolic pathways\". GO terms for \"Cell differentiation (GOBP)\" and \"Extracellular region (GOCC)\" were enriched both in up- and down-regulated genes, suggesting aberrant expression of genes associated with cell differentiation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. GSEA data supported the enrichment analyses data. Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that high expression of homeobox C6 (<i>HOXC6</i>) (p=0.048), nucleobindin 2 (<i>NUCB2</i>) (p=0.007), IL12A antisense RNA 1 (<i>IL12A-AS1</i>) (p=0.001), calcium-binding protein 39-like (<i>CAB39L</i>)(p=0.038)<i>,</i> nitric oxide synthase traffickin<i>g</i> (<i>NOSTRIN</i>) (p=0.024), SLC8A1 antisense RNA 1 (<i>SLC8A1-AS1</i>) (p=0.016), were the significantly correlated with poorer prognosis. Conclusions Based on bioinformatical approaches, we identified significantly enriched gene sets and novel candidates for prognostic markers or therapeutic targets in HNSCC. Further investigation would aid in determining the anti-cancer effects of these candidates.",

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and deadly primary brain tumor in adults. While in vitro patient-derived xenografts (PDX) lines are useful for studying GBM, they often exclude astrocytes and macrophages, which contribute significantly to tumor growth, invasion, and chemoradioresistance. Integrating these cells into tumor models is difficult due to their need for serum, which triggers GBM-PDX lines to lose their stem-like properties. The aim of this study was to develop a serum-free triculture model of GBM-PDX lines, normal human astrocytes (NHAs), and macrophages. Serum-free media alternatives were formulated for NHAs and identified for THP-1 macrophages, then combined with GBM PDX media to establish \"PSX,\" an experimental maintenance media. Cells were transitioned to serum-free media alternatives and functionally assessed through several parameters unique to each cell type. In addition to assessing GBM \"stemness,\" a custom 350-gene NanoString chip was used to assess differential gene expression in monocultured PDX cells versus PDX cells exposed to NHAs and macrophages. PSX maintained canonical function in astrocytes and macrophages while preserving the stem-like properties of GBM-PDX cells. Tri-culturing all three cells increased the expression of stemness-associated transcription factors and increased the expression of genes related to stemness and hypoxia in GBM cells. GBM PDX cells exposed to NHAs and macrophages in direct triculture exhibit increases in markers of stemness and hypoxia. These findings suggest that the serum-free triculture model presented herein may better recapitulate the tumoral heterogeneity of GBM in vitro, providing a novel model to utilize in current research.",

          "abstract": "Perineural invasion (PNI) is common in a variety of solid tumors and has been identified as an important pathway promoting tumor local invasion and distant metastasis. Its presence is usually associated with increased aggressiveness, malignant biology, and a worse patient prognosis. However, its specific role and regulatory mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. In this study, we integrated 20 CRC single-cell transcriptome datasets, which contained 575,768 high-quality cells, and used the Scissor algorithm to map PNI phenotypes in TCGA bulk samples to the single-cell level. Nine cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) subpopulations were identified and functionally annotated. We evaluated the clinical relevance of CAF subsets in TCGA and three independent cohorts (silu_2022, GSE39582, and GSE17536) using BayesPrism-based deconvolution. We analyzed transcriptional regulatory networks using pySCENIC and validated PRRX2 function by <i>in vitro</i> experiments. Immune infiltration characteristics were quantified using the ssGSEA score, and the association between the PRRX2 score and immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy was analyzed in conjunction with two immunotherapy cohorts. In addition, we performed a drug sensitivity analysis based on the GDSC pharmacogenomics database to screen potential therapeutic agents. In this study, we systematically revealed the characteristics of the perineural invasion-associated fibroblast subsets and their regulatory mechanisms. In PNI-positive tumors, the proportion of fibroblasts was significantly increased, with the enrichment of MMP2+ myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts (myCAFs), and facilitated perineural infiltration through extracellular matrix remodeling. Further analysis revealed that PRRX2 was a core regulator of MMP2+myCAFs, promoting perineural invasion through the activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways. PRRX2 knockdown significantly inhibited fibroblast proliferation, clonogenic formation, and invasive migration capacity, and it reduced TGFB1 and NGF expressions. The clinical cohort validation demonstrated a significant correlation between the PRRX2-score and advanced tumor stage, along with vascular and lympho-vascular invasion (LVI). Furthermore, patients with high PRRX2 scores had a significantly worse prognosis. In addition, patients with high PRRX2 scores responded poorly to immune checkpoint inhibitors but may be sensitive to targeted agents or antibody-coupled drugs, which may serve as potential targets for combination therapy. This analysis established PRRX2-driven MMP2+myCAFs as pivotal mediators of CRC perineural invasion through TGF-\u03b2/ECM remodeling. The PRRX2 score serves as a biomarker for prognosis prediction and immunotherapy outcome.",

However, there is still a lack of pan-cancer analysis of KRT6A in humans. We studied the pan-cancer role of KRT6A with the help of a variety of external public databases (mainly including TCGA, GTEx, HPA, TIMER2.0, UALCAN, TISIDB, GEPIA2, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, cBioPortal and TISCH2, etc.). We performed immunohistochemistry detection of KRT6A protein expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and its adjacent normal tissues. The results showed that KRT6A mRNA and protein were differentially expressed in most tumors, and its expression and function may be regulated by DNA methylation, RNA methylation and protein phosphorylation, and were related to the prognosis and clinical subtypes of patients with different tumors. KRT6A has multiple genetic and epigenetic characteristics in different cancers, and the main type of its genetic variation is mutation. At the same time, KRT6A is closely related to tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor stemness score (TSC), immune checkpoints, immunomodulatory genes, and tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in different human tumors. Secondly, the expression level of KRT6A is associated with immunotherapy and drug sensitivity. In addition, bioinformatics analysis and immunohistochemistry experiments verified that KRT6A mRNA and protein were up-regulated in LUAD, and could promote the development process of LUAD by promoting processes such as epidermis development, intermediate filament cytoskeleton and cornified envelope. This is the first pan-cancer analysis of KRT6A, which provides a comprehensive and systematic understanding of its role in various human tumors, and also reveals that KRT6A is expected to become a potential prognostic biomarker and a new target for cancer immunotherapy.",

However, its pan-cancer roles, prognostic significance, immune interactions, and therapeutic targeting remain underexplored. We conducted a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis integrating multi-omics data from public databases, including TIMER2.0, GEPIA2, TISIDB, and cBioPortal, to evaluate EME1 expression, genetic alterations, and their association with clinical outcomes, immune infiltration, and molecular pathways. Virtual screening of 3180 FDA-approved drugs and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to identify and validate potential EME1 inhibitors. EME1 was significantly overexpressed in various human cancers and positively associated with advanced tumor grade and stage. High EME1 expression and mutations were linked to poor overall and disease-free survival. Immunogenomic profiling revealed strong positive correlations between EME1 and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), alongside a negative association with endothelial cell function, suggesting immunosuppressive roles. Machine learning models based on EME1-associated genes demonstrated high predictive accuracy for liver hepatocellular carcinoma (AUC\u2009>\u20090.90). Virtual screening identified eight promising drug candidates, including Everolimus and Dioscin, with strong binding affinities. MD simulations confirmed the stability of these interactions, particularly for Dioscin. This study reveals the multifaceted oncogenic roles of EME1 in tumor progression, immune evasion, and prognosis. It proposes EME1 as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target across multiple cancer types. The identified drug candidates warrant further in vitro and in vivo validation for potential repurposing in EME1-targeted cancer therapy.",

While the immunosuppressive effects of ultraviolet (UV) light are well-documented, its link to ICI resistance remains unclear. We analyzed publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from ICI-treated patients to explore the relationship between UV response (UVR) and treatment outcomes. A novel UVR gene signature (UVR.Sig) was established using 34 scRNA-seq datasets and validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pan-cancer cohorts and 10 ICI cohorts. Key genes (Hub-UVR.Sig) were identified via six machine learning algorithms, and breast cancer (BRCA) subtypes were classified through consensus clustering. Biological effects of Hub-UVR.Sig genes were confirmed <i>in vitro</i>. UVR.Sig was associated with ICI resistance and correlated with inhibitory immune cell infiltration and pro-tumor pathways in pan-cancer data. The UVR.Sig-based model achieved good predictive performance for ICI outcomes (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.727). In BRCA, Hub-UVR.Sig stratified patients into two subtypes, with high Hub-UVR.Sig expression linked to stronger immune evasion and lower immunogenicity. ENO2 and ATP6V1F were highly expressed in BRCA tissues, and ENO2 was correlated with worse prognosis in BRCA patients. Knockdown of ENO2 reduced cell proliferation and invasion. We reveal for the first time that UVR is strongly associated with ICI resistance. The UVR.Sig feature offers the potential to identify patients who respond to immunotherapy and to tailor BRCA treatment strategies.",

It develops from preneoplastic lesions to adenocarcinoma, but these early genetic alterations remain poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to identify early genetic drivers underlying the development of preneoplastic lesions and the initiation of gastric carcinogenesis. We characterized preneoplastic and early gastric adenocarcinoma using 48 samples from 16 Guatemalan patients, a country with a high incidence of GC. We sequenced a panel of 127 genes to identify early genetic drivers and possible actionable targets. We identified extensive genetic heterogeneity, including single nucleotide and copy number variations. After comparing our data with other studies, we identified <i>TP53</i> and <i>APC</i> as the most mutated genes in preneoplastic lesions and early GC. Our mean tumor mutational burden was higher in diffuse (0.017 mutations/Mb) and intestinal adenocarcinomas (0.015) than in chronic gastritis (0.005), and analysis of the mutational signatures revealed several processes acting at different stages of the disease. Signatures S15 (DNA mismatch repair deficiency) and S03 (homologous recombination deficiency) were more frequent in early adenocarcinoma than in chronic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, necrosis, tubular adenoma, and atrophy. Notably, 10 of 16 patients (62.5%) had at least one actionable mutation in their preneoplastic lesions or gastric adenocarcinomas. We show that at the preneoplastic and earliest stages, GC is genetically heterogeneous and presents key cancer-driving mutations that may participate in neoplastic transformation and progression, with 62.5% of lesions having the potential for treatment. This study expands the limited research on early GC and highlights key opportunities for precision medicine in populations with high GC incidence.",

Despite advances in treatment, drug resistance remains a critical challenge. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), a multifunctional cell surface protein, shows variable expression across malignancies and plays a role in cancer biology. DPP4 inhibitors, initially developed as antidiabetic agents, have demonstrated anticancer properties in several cancer types. In this study, network pharmacology analysis revealed that DPP4 inhibitors modulate critical cancer-associated pathways, such as proteoglycans in cancer, ECM(extracellular matrix)-receptor interaction, and PI3K-AKT (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B) signaling. Experimental data showed dose-dependent growth inhibition in four CRC cell lines treated with FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-approved and novel DPP4 inhibitors. Combination treatments with doxorubicin yielded synergistic effects, whereas those with 5-fluorouracil (5FU) were either synergistic or additive. The examined DPP4 inhibitors effectively suppressed colony formation in HCT-116 cells and induced apoptosis. Additionally, the inhibitors resulted in G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and significantly reduced the expression of CD26 (Cluster of Differentiation 26), Bcl-2(B-cell lymphoma 2), and VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) in HCT-116 cells. Our findings highlight the potential therapeutic utility of DPP4 inhibitors in CRC treatment, either as standalone agents or in combination with standard chemotherapeutics. Moreover, the computational insights provided herein enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of DPP4 inhibitors, paving the way for their potential clinical application.",

Based on the GC dataset in TCGA, we constructed a prognostic signature using M1 TAMs-related genes and validated it using data from the GEO dataset. To evaluate the predictive power of the signature, the survival curves, ROC curves, Cox regression analysis, nomograms and calibration curves were constructed. Differences in immune infiltration, immunotherapy response, and chemotherapy sensitivity between the two risk groups were also analysed. Furthermore, by jointly using the string database and Cytoscape software, we identified the hub gene that differed between the two risk groups. In the end, the expression and function of the identified hub gene were validated using fresh tissue specimens and GC\u00a0cell lines. A six-gene risk signature was developed based on M1 TAMs-related genes. Furthermore, the ROC curve, nomogram, calibration plot of the nomogram and Cox regression analysis confirmed M1 TAMs co-expressed genes have a strong predictive performance of the six-gene risk signature. Immune infiltration analysis and the TIDE algorithm indicated that low-risk GC patients may be more suitable for immunotherapy. Finally, fibronectin 1 (FN1), the hub gene with the highest degree of interaction between high- and low-risk groups, indicated a significant correlation with survival differences in GC. Functional analysis demonstrated that FN1 promotes GC\u00a0cell proliferation, invasion, migration and EMT. The risk signature of six M1 TAMs co-expressed genes can be used to evaluate the prognosis and treatment efficacy of patients with GC, providing a basis for selecting new therapies for patients. The FN1 gene is the hub gene with predictive value in this signature, and it is upregulated in GC and functions as an oncogene.",

A comprehensive analysis of all cancer data deposited on COSMIC reveals very few samples with mutations in both PRMT5 and TIP60 or components of the 9-1-1 complex in samples where mutations in other DNA damage repair genes occur (e.g., MRN, checkpoint genes, etc). This suggests that when more factors of the DNA damage repair machinery are destabilized, the functions of TIP60 and 9-1-1 appear to become essential. Protein 3-D structure analysis shows that mutations affect protein-protein interactions that may destabilize 9-1-1 or TIP60 complex formation. These data highlight interesting interactions between the various genetic pathways governing DSB repair. It also reveals potential therapeutic targets. For example, inhibition of the 9-1-1 complex in a PRMT5 mutant may selectively kill the cell. Given that PRMT5 small molecule inhibitors are being developed or already deployed, these findings should inform potential applications of these drugs.",

          "abstract": "Cancer is a complex disease characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, often driven by dysregulated cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), particularly CDK2, which plays a crucial role in cell cycle progression. Aberrant CDK2 activity is associated with tumor growth and resistance to therapy, making CDK2 a promising therapeutic target. The main focus of this research is to integrate the multi-omics-based pan-cancer analysis of CDK2 to identify novel plant-derived inhibitors, bridging the prognostic and therapeutic relevance of CDK2 across various cancer types. In this study, to evaluate CDK2's expression, prognostic behavior, genetic alterations, and immune infiltrations, we performed pan-cancer analysis. The oncogenic analysis showed that CDK2 is significantly overexpressed in multiple tumor types and, in some cancers, which correlated with poor overall and disease-free survival, indicating its potential as a context-dependent prognostic biomarker. The involvement of CDK2 in key cell cycle and oncogenic pathways was investigated, highlighting its centrality in tumor proliferation networks. Additionally, cheminformatics and machine learning approaches were applied to screen phytocompounds from six medicinal plants, and the top phytocompounds (>pIC<sub>50</sub> = 5.1) were then subjected to molecular docking, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and dynamics simulation studies. Docking results revealed that withanolide M, withanolide K, and ergosterol showed the highest binding affinities against CDK2, with scores of -10.2, -10.1, and -9.9 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. These lead phytocompounds exhibited high potency, excellent pharmacokinetic properties, and minimal predicted toxicity as compared with the control inhibitor of CDK2. The binding stability of the protein-ligand complexes was confirmed by dynamic simulations along with MM-GBSA calculations, with the results supporting our previously reported affinity score. Therefore, these phytocompounds could be potential CDK2 inhibitors, warranting exploration in future cancer research. Furthermore, additional experimental and clinical validations are required to confirm the efficacy and efficiency of these potential lead compounds.",

Here, to define how TP53 mutations affect the LUAD tumor microenvironment (TME), we constructed a multiomic cellular and spatial atlas of 23 treatment-naive human lung tumors. We found that TP53-mutant malignant cells lose alveolar identity and upregulate highly proliferative and entropic gene expression programs consistently across LUAD tumors from resectable clinical samples, genetically engineered mouse models, and cell lines harboring a wide spectrum of TP53 mutations. We further identified a multicellular tumor niche composed of SPP1<sup>+</sup> macrophages and collagen-expressing fibroblasts that coincides with hypoxic, prometastatic expression programs in TP53-mutant tumors. Spatially correlated angiostatic and immune checkpoint interactions, including CD274-PDCD1 and PVR-TIGIT, are also enriched in TP53-mutant LUAD tumors and likely engender a more favorable response to checkpoint blockade therapy. Our systematic approach can be used to investigate genotype-associated TMEs in other cancers.",

Herein, we aimed to investigate the role of the FZD7-mediated signaling in immature phenotype and aggressiveness of HCC. Firstly, 499 human HCCs were used for clinical and molecular comparisons regarding the expression of FZD7 and stemness-associated markers. We showed that FZD7 overexpression was associated with poor differentiation and, in combination with CD133, predicted a poor outcome of patients with aggressive recurrence. Next, the impact of WNT3/FZD7 signaling on the differentiation of hepatic cells was assessed in HCC cell lines, as well in the non-transformed progenitor HepaRG cell line and in primary human hepatocytes, transduced with WNT3 and FZD7-expressing lentiviruses. We demonstrated that the ectopic expression of WNT3 and FZD7 inhibited the differentiation behavior of HepaRG cells and human primary hepatocytes, amplified the pool of EpCAM(+), CD90(+) and CD133(+) subsets of HCC cell lines, and increased their cancer stem cell features. Moreover, we found that WNT3/FZD7-mediated stemness properties of cancer cells were independent of the stemness-associated marker NANOG. In conclusion, we identified the FZD7(+)/CD133(+) signature as a potential prognosis marker and molecular therapeutic target, and we strengthened the hypothesis for the involvement of FZD7 in the enrichment of a cancer stem cell pool in HCC.",

          "abstract": "Tumor genomic profiling has uncovered many cancer drivers whose implications in terms of tumor biology and therapeutic actionability remain understudied. Hotspot mutations in <i>SF3B1</i> induce widespread transcriptomic alterations and occur across multiple cancer types. Despite this, the biological and clinical consequences of <i>SF3B1</i> mutations remain elusive. Characterization of the largest <i>SF3B1</i> mutant breast cancer clinical cohort to date identifies <i>SF3B1</i> driver mutations in approximately 2.5% of HR+ HER2- breast cancer, with strong enrichment of K700E substitutions, substantial variation in variant allele fraction (VAF), and significantly improved overall survival due to enrichment in Luminal A disease. In vitro and in vivo studies in representative cell models suggest several of the most prevalent <i>SF3B1</i> mutations have deleterious effects on cell growth, leading to selective loss of the mutation over time, providing a rationale for the low frequency and low VAF of <i>SF3B1</i> mutations in breast cancer. Though all introduced hotspot mutations limit growth and are reverted to wildtype (WT) over time, mutations at position R625 have a more pronounced phenotype than K700E, providing an explanation for the clinically observed skew in mutation frequencies. RNA and DNA sequencing analyses were used to identify characteristic pathway-level transcriptomic changes in <i>SF3B1</i>-mutant cells and identify copy number alterations as a mechanism of both improved mutation tolerability and a means to eliminate the mutation over time. These data suggest that while <i>SF3B1</i> mutations are enriched in some clinical contexts, their role in breast tumorigenesis is highly complex and dependent on secondary events that overcome their deleterious effects on cell growth and survival.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the heterogeneity of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated tumors and delineating the natural historical evolution of cell signaling are essential for interpreting tumor initiation, preventing tumor progression from benign plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs) to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), and engineering effective treatments. The neural crest-derived Schwann cell precursor (SCP)-like tumor population interacts with different cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly macrophages, continually shaping the intrinsic and extrinsic NF1 tumor heterogeneity. Through integrated analyses of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics, we reveal that SPP1-CD44 signaling is initiated by SCP-like tumor cells in pNF, operating through autocrine mechanisms. However, in MPNST, a distinct subset of macrophages becomes the dominant SPP1 signaling source while the SCP-like cells maintain autocrine signaling. The role of SPP1 in tumorigenesis is validated by the significantly extended survival in the MPNST mouse model with cisNf1<sup>+/-</sup>;Trp53<sup>+/-</sup>;Spp1<sup>-/-</sup> configuration. Notably, our analysis of the pre-tumor stage in the DhhCre;Nf1<sup>-/-</sup> pNF mouse model demonstrates upregulated Spp1 expression compared to control tissue in Nes<sup>+</sup> Schwann lineage cells. Together, these findings elucidate the natural historical dynamics of SPP1-CD44 signaling during tumor initiation and progression from pNF to MPNST, and highlight the SPP1-CD44 signaling axis as a potential therapeutic target to disrupt tumor stemness properties and reprogram the immune TME in malignancies.",

          "abstract": "Despite the advent of immune-oncological therapies, patients with advanced NRAS-mutant melanoma still have a significantly worse prognosis than their BRAF-mutant counterparts. This is mainly due to a high propensity for resistance to available therapies targeting the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (MAPKi). Preclinical studies and mouse models have implicated the stress-activated MEK5/ERK5 MAPK cascade as a major resistance pathway activated by MAPKi-based targeted therapy in NRAS-mutant melanoma. Accordingly, MAPKi/ERK5i co-inhibition was capable of triggering a sustained cell cycle arrest in NRAS-mutant melanoma cells, but the key mediator(s) of its vigorous anti-proliferative effect remain elusive. Here, we further investigated the mechanism of MAPKi/ERK5i-induced cell cycle arrest in NRAS-mutant melanoma cells using both genetic methods and pharmacological inhibitors. Transcriptome analysis of human NRAS-mutant melanoma cells established that MAPKi/ERK5iinduced a near-complete shutdown of the mitotic machinery as consequence of a sustained G1 cell cycle arrest. This arrest was not only observed in diverse treatment-na\u00efve melanoma cells but could also be induced in cells that already had developed resistance to therapeutic MEK inhibition (MEKi) and was accompanied by suppression of Cyclin D1 and E2F-mediated gene expression. Forced expression of Cyclin D1 and its effector kinase CDK4 restored cell cycle progression and mitotic gene expression in NRAS-mutant melanoma cells exposed to MEKi/ERK5i, implying Cyclin D/CDK4 activity as major target of combined MEKi/ERK5i. These findings suggest Cyclin D/CDK4 dependency as a major vulnerability of NRAS-mutant melanoma that could effectively be targeted by combined MAPKi/ERK5i.",

However, to date, there have been no comprehensive reports investigating the role of CGB5 in pan-cancer analysis. In this study, an in-depth investigation of CGB5 in pan-cancer was conducted through multiple public databases, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Human Protein Atlas (HPA), UALCAN, cBioPortal Platform, Gene Set Cancer Analysis (GSCA), Kaplan-Meier Plotter, TIMER, TISIDB, SangerBox Website, and Metascape database. The genomic, transcriptomic, epigenetic, immune microenvironmental, and clinical prognostic significance of CGB5 across various cancers was systematically analyzed. Furthermore, CGB5 expression in gastric cancer cells was experimentally detected, and the potential mechanisms underlying its impact on prognosis were elucidated. This study shows that CGB5 exhibits diverse expression patterns in most tumors, including high, low, or no significant expression changes. Compared to normal tissues, CGB5 is significantly up-regulated in six tumor types, such as liver, lung, and gastric cancers. Its expression correlates positively with tumor stroma content and immune grading but negatively with immunological markers. Additionally, CGB5 is associated with specific immune sub-types in various cancers, including endometrial, testicular germ cell, and gastric adenocarcinoma, and closely linked to clinical features of gastric cancer patients. CGB5 primarily involves immune-related pathways, such as \"Primary immunodeficiency,\" \"CD8 TCR signaling pathway,\" and \"PD-1 checkpoint signaling.\" This study demonstrates that CGB5 expression is closely associated with immune cell infiltration across cancer types, showing significant variation in infiltration patterns among tumor types. CGB5 is significantly up-regulated in various malignancies and strongly correlates with cancer patient prognoses, specifically in malignancies like GC and PAAD. Overall, these findings indicate CGB5 as a promising biomarker for pan-cancer diagnosis and prognosis.",

Mechanistically, <i>LMNA</i> loss disrupts nuclear pore complex distribution, reducing phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-nucleoporin incorporation and impairing RNA export efficiency. Furthermore, we show that <i>LMNA</i> expression is epigenetically repressed by <i>EZH2</i> during SCLC differentiation from neuroendocrine (NE) to non-NE states. Clinically, low <i>LMNA</i> levels correlate with significantly worse survival in SCLC patients. These findings uncover a novel role for <i>LMNA</i> in safeguarding genome integrity and shaping tumor heterogeneity, with broad implications for cancer and aging.",

Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n = 584) and the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) (n = 1,355) cohorts, we analyzed luminal ILC and IDC, excluding mixed type, in patients with stage I-III breast cancer. ILC was associated with Nottingham histological grade 2, larger tumor size and more stage III disease than IDC (all P < 0.01) but no difference in lymph node nor distant metastasis in both cohorts. There was no survival difference between ILC and IDC. ILC had less aggressive genomic features compared to IDC, and the cell proliferation score and Ki67 gene expression were significantly lower in ILC in TCGA (P < 0.001); however, these findings were not validated in METABRIC. Hallmark cell proliferation-related gene sets (E2F targets, G2M checkpoint, MYC targets V1, and MTORC1 signaling) were significantly less enriched in ILC in both cohorts (all normalized enrichment score (NES) > 1.4, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.12). While ILC appeared to have a lower trend of pathological complete response (pCR) in the GSE20194 and GSE1140494 cohorts, ILC was infiltrated with significantly more CD4<sup>+</sup> cells and dendritic cells and significantly less T helper type I (Th1) cells, regulatory T cells and M1 and M2 macrophages in both cohorts (all P < 0.05). Stromal cells, adipocytes and lymphatic endothelial cells were highly infiltrated in ILC, and cytolytic activity that represented the global anti-tumor immunity was significantly elevated in ILC in TCGA and subsequently validated in METABRIC. ILC has higher immune response and immune cell infiltration than IDC in the luminal subtype.",

In this study, we comprehensively investigated HMOX1 across diverse tumor types utilizing the cancer genome atlas (TCGA). We further integrated data from multiple bioinformatics platforms, including TIMER2, UALCAN, GEPIA2, cBioPortal, R, GSCA, and LinkedOmics. Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed differential HMOX1 expression between normal renal epithelial cells and KIRC cells. Functional assays <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> demonstrated that HMOX1 regulates proliferation, migration, and cell-cycle progression in 786-O and Caki-1 cells. Pan-cancer analyses revealed that HMOX1 is aberrantly expressed across multiple malignancies with significant associations with the tumor stage. Survival analyses indicated that elevated HMOX1 expression predicted poor overall survival (OS) in LGG (<i>P</i> = 0.025) but favorable OS and disease-free survival (DFS) in KIRC (OS: <i>P</i> = 0.00062; DFS: <i>P</i> = 9 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup>). Moreover, mutations were the predominant genetic alteration affecting HMOX1, while promoter methylation was broadly reduced across cancers. HMOX1 expression positively correlated with immune infiltration by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (KIRC: Spearman <i>\u03c1</i> = 0.26, FDR = 2.56 \u00d7 10<sup>-8</sup>) and macrophages (KIRC: Spearman <i>\u03c1</i> = 0.32, FDR = 2.77 \u00d7 10<sup>-13</sup>). Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses in KIRC implicated HMOX1 in the chemokine and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. Both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments demonstrated that HMOX1 knockdown accelerates cell-cycle progression and enhances proliferation and migration in 786-O and Caki-1 cells. Collectively, our findings establish HMOX1 as a promising prognostic biomarker and potential immunotherapeutic target across multiple cancers.",

Despite its significance, a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of ZNF703 remains underexplored. In this study, we performed a systematic pan-cancer analysis to elucidate the mechanistic and functional roles of ZNF703 in tumorigenesis. Our findings reveal that elevated ZNF703 expression is significantly correlated with cancer progression, adverse clinical outcomes, and the enrichment of immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and M2 macrophages, suggesting its pivotal role in modulating tumor immunity. Mechanistically, ZNF703 regulates tumor immunity by binding to promoter sequences, thereby suppressing the expression of CD274, ICAM1, and CXCL3, which may facilitate tumor immune escape. Additionally, we identified functional hub genes associated with ZNF703, including DDHD2, LSM1, and BAG4. Notably, ZNF703, DDHD2, LSM1, and BAG4 are co-localized within the amplicons at the chromosome 8p11-p12 region, indicating a potential cooperative role in driving cancer initiation and progression. Collectively, these findings underscore the essential roles of ZNF703 in cancer development, patient prognosis, and the regulation of anti-tumor immunity, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for cancer detection and as a novel immunotherapeutic target.",

This study presents an extensive pan-cancer analysis We systematically evaluated the expression patterns, prognostic and diagnostic significance, genetic alterations, alternative splicing events, functional pathways, immune infiltration characteristics, and therapeutic responses of ILF2 across diverse cancer types. ILF2 was broadly upregulated across multiple cancers and correlated with poor prognosis, genomic alterations, and proliferation-related pathways. Its expression was also associated with immune infiltration and immune subtypes. In hepatocellular carcinoma, ILF2 mainly expresses in malignant hepatocytes at the single-cell RNA-seq level, and high ILF2 predicted therapeutic resistance and worse survival outcomes. ILF2 may serve as a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic targeting. In particular, it holds promise as a novel therapeutic target in hepatocellular carcinoma.",

Thus, intricate regulation is required for physiological function. Attempts to modulate PERK activity have shown that the determinants of adaptive vs. maladaptive signaling remain ambiguous. Here, with purified protein, we provide evidence that PERK binds copper, identifies residues required for interaction, and demonstrates that copper is necessary for kinase activity. Furthermore, cellular PERK activity can be modulated via copper availability, and this regulatory relationship can be manipulated to dictate ER stress tolerance. Critically, these phenomena translate to phenotypes in vivo, as C. elegans harboring a \"PERK-copper mutant\" exhibit exacerbated ER-stress sensitivity. The copper-PERK paradigm suggests that copper homeostasis, as a regulator of PERK, may constitute a critical factor in resolving the long-standing ambiguity in endeavors to therapeutically target PERK.",

The aberrant protein can be recognized by the immune system as no-self, triggering an immune response against cells expressing this aberrant protein which could mediate tumor control or rejection. Since the expression of this mutated protein is exclusive to tumor cells, great efforts are being made to identify neoantigens of relevance in the development of new cancer treatment strategies. In comparison to adulthood tumors, pediatric malignancies present fewer mutations and thus fewer potential neoantigens. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy worldwide that can be benefited by the identification of neoantigens for immunotherapy approaches, the landscape of neoantigens in ALL is not well known, therefore the aim of our study was to identify potential neoantigens in ALL pediatric patients. <b>Methods</b>: To identify neoantigens in ALL, whole-exome sequencing of matched tumor-normal cells from pediatric cases was performed, with these data HLA-I alleles predicted and somatic mutations identified to propose potential neoantigens based on binding affinity of mutated peptide-HLA-I. <b>Results</b>: We found a strong correlation between tumor mutational burden (TMB) and neoantigen load (<i>p</i> < 0.001) but no correlation with prognosis. Furthermore, TMB and neoantigens were greater in ALL patients with at least one mutated DNA mismatch repair gene (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Also, differences between B- and T-cell ALL were found but statistical significance did not remain after permutation. <b>Conclusions</b>: The presence of neoantigens in pediatric cases with ALL makes the neoantigen-based immunotherapy a promising new strategy for the treatment of this malignancy, especially for patients with relapse.",

However, identifying therapeutic targets for LGGs remains elusive. To uncover the molecular features of LGGs, functional genomics data have been investigated. <b>Methods</b>: Using public transcriptomics data of LGGs (The Cancer Genome Atlas and GSE107850), differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially co-expressed (DCE) gene pairs between IDH mutation statuses were determined.

Whereas only seven gene pairs showed significant differential co-expression in both datasets, 1016 genes were simultaneously involved in differential co-expression. Gene set enrichment revealed that biological processes related to neuronal tissue formation were significantly associated with the DEGs. Using drug repurposing analysis, it was found that NVP-TAE684 and bisindolylmaleimide were possible chemical compounds for the LGG treatment. <b>Conclusions:</b> Using transcriptomics data, molecular mechanisms associated with LGG prognosis were identified.

In this work, we introduce semantic annotations for genes in different cell types based on cell biology knowledge, enabling the model to achieve interpretability at the cellular level. Since these cell type annotations are derived from the unique sites of origin for each cancer type, they can be more closely aligned with morphological features in whole slide images (WSIs) and address the issue of genomic annotation ambiguity. We then propose a multimodal fusion model, SurvTransformer, with multi-layer attention to fuse cell type tags (CTTs) and WSIs for survival prediction. Finally, through attention and integrated gradient attribution, the model provides biologically meaningful interpretable analysis at three different levels: cell type, gene, and histopathology image. Comparative experiments show that SurvTransformer achieves the highest consistency index across four cancer datasets. The survival curves generated are also statistically significant. Ablation experiments show that SurvTransformer outperforms models based on different labeling methods and attention representations.

          "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) and tumor-infiltrating B cells within the germinal centers of TLSs in the tumor microenvironment of thyroid cancer, utilizing a morphological approach. Histological samples from patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) (n = 112) stained with hematoxylin and eosin were examined. The presence of lymphoid neogenesis in PTC was determined based on morphological features and classified according to TLS location and maturation status. Immunofluorescence staining was performed on selected cases to identify B cells within mature TLSs. Additionally, 499 scanned slides from the PTC cohort in The Cancer Genome Atlas - Thyroid Carcinoma (TCGA-THCA) dataset were accessed via cBioPortal to assess the presence of TLSs and compare the clinical and molecular characteristics of PTC cases with and without TLSs. Tertiary lymphoid structures, resembling ectopic lymph nodes, were identified in 41% (46/112) of the histological PTC samples. Among these, 63% (29/46) were located in peritumoral regions, while 13% (6/46) were found within the intratumoral area. Mature TLSs containing germinal centers, in which B cells were detected, were observed in 15% (7/46) of cases. Immature TLSs were detected in 52% (24/46) of PTC cases with TLSs. Analysis of PTC scanned images from cBioPortal revealed TLSs in 8.4% of cases, of which 62% harbored the BRAFV600E mutation, along with upregulation of immune cell markers and SLC5A5 (NIS) expression. The identification of TLSs across multiple malignancies underscores their functional significance in modulating tumor-immune interactions with clinical implications. Therefore, the identification and morphological characterization of TLSs in PTC may provide valuable insights into their potential as immunobiomarkers in thyroid cancer.",

Here, we demonstrate that STK11 links interleukin-4 (IL-4) signaling with metabolic reprogramming to restrain alternatively activated (M2) macrophage polarization. Through integrative transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we identified STK11 as a key transcriptional and metabolic regulator during M2 polarization. STK11 deficiency enhanced the expression of M2-associated markers and promoted glutamine metabolism in IL-4-stimulated macrophages. Mechanistically, STK11 deficiency led to increased FOXO1 activation, thereby promoting M2 polarization. Pharmacological inhibition of FOXO1 or glutamine metabolism effectively reversed the enhanced M2 polarization. In an orthotopic model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, myeloid-specific deletion of STK11 resulted in increased accumulation of M2-like tumor-associated macrophages, impaired antitumor immunity, and accelerated tumor progression. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for STK11 in modulating M2 macrophage polarization, offering mechanistic insights that may inform the development of immunometabolic therapies for pancreatic cancer.",

RNA sequencing analysis identified Keratin-1 (KRT1) as a gene potentially associated with cancer recurrence. This study investigated the association between KRT1 expression and recurrence in advanced laryngeal cancer. RNA sequencing was performed to identify candidate genes associated with recurrence. The effects of KRT1 expression on clinical outcomes were evaluated in patients with laryngeal cancer. Multiple experimental techniques were utilized. RNA sequencing of patient samples demonstrated higher KRT1 gene expression in the recurrence group than in non-recurrent cases. Patients with KRT1-positive immunostaining exhibited trends of worse overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). In vitro studies showed that KRT1 knockdown suppressed tumor cell invasion, cell migration, and expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines. KRT1 knockdown enhanced tumor cell apoptosis and exhibited synergistic effects with conventional radiation and chemotherapy treatments. KRT1 may serve as a biomarker for predicting advanced laryngeal cancer recurrence and assist with selecting patients to receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Further molecular investigations are warranted to determine its effects, but KRT1 has potential as a therapeutic target.",

This study aims to explore the potential significance of TRNT1 in cancer, particularly in breast cancer (BC) progression and prognosis. A pan-cancer analysis of TRNT1 was conducted using various online bioinformatics tools, including GEPIA2, cBioPortal, TIMER2, Metascape, and UALCAN, combined with experimental validation. The analysis encompassed gene expression, prognosis, genomic alterations, immune infiltration, and functional enrichment. Additionally, in\u00a0vitro experiments were performed to further investigate TRNT1's role in BC. TRNT1 is highly expressed in most cancers, with significant correlation to prognosis, especially in BC. Promoter methylation and genomic alterations may contribute to its abnormal expression. Furthermore, functional enrichment analysis revealed that TRNT1-associated genes are primarily involved in protein processing and RNA metabolism. Our study also represents the first evidence that TRNT1 is overexpressed in BC, participates in tumour proliferation, and may regulate apoptosis through the P53 pathway. This initial pan-cancer study provides a relatively comprehensive understanding of the oncogenic role of TRNT1 across various cancers and highlights its potential as a biomarker for BC.",

SMAD4 inactivation is a paradigm of such mutations and a hallmark of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). To determine whether metastatic tumors are dependent on SMAD4 inactivation, we developed a mouse model of PDAC that enables spatiotemporal control of Smad4 expression. While Smad4 inactivation in the premalignant pancreas facilitated the formation of primary tumors, Smad4 reactivation in metastatic disease suppressed liver metastases but promoted lung metastases. These divergent effects were underpinned by organ-biased differences in the tumor cells' chromatin state that emerged in the premalignant pancreas and were distinguished by the dominance of KLF4 versus RUNX1 transcription factors. Our results show how epigenetic states favored by the organ of residence can influence the output of driver mutations in metastatic tumors, which has implications for interpreting tumor genetics and therapeutically targeting metastatic disease.",

Despite various efforts to reduce cancer mortality, such as decreasing tobacco use, improving early detection and prevention methods, and enhancing cancer care and treatments, certain racial and ethnic groups continue to experience higher cancer incidence and mortality rates, along with shorter survival compared to other groups. Several factors, including socioeconomic status, environmental influences, diet, and behavior, contribute to these racial disparities. More importantly, scientists have identified a genetic basis for these observations, with a growing body of research highlighting microRNAs as significant players in cancer racial disparities. This review focuses on various types of microRNAs (such as epigenetically regulated, copy number altered, circulating, and exosomal) and microRNA single-nucleotide variations in the context of cancer-related racial disparities. Additionally, we have summarized the existing resources, including racial-specific model cell lines and cancer cohorts that include patients from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. Moreover, we provide here several key things to consider for future investigations. While many challenges remain, we aim to offer a balanced overview of this field to help scientists with varying expertise address these issues.

We identified many previously unappreciated epigenomic tumor suppressor and tumor dependency genes. We show that a specific HBO1 complex and MLL1 complex are robust tumor suppressors in lung adenocarcinoma. Histone modifications generated by the HBO1 complex are frequently reduced in human lung adenocarcinomas and are associated with worse clinical features.

Using a novel functional genomics method in vivo, we investigated epigenomic regulators in lung tumorigenesis. We discovered multiple novel genes that affect tumor growth.

The effectiveness of predictive, preventive, and personalized treatment strategies is limited by a lack of reliable prognostic biomarkers. Radiotherapy significantly reduces breast cancer recurrence risk and prolongs patients' lives. However, the role of radiation-related genes in breast cancer remains unclear. Differentially expressed radiation-related genes were identified through analysis of the BRCA gene expression matrix between radiation and non-radiation groups. Multi-omics investigation, including bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, was conducted to explore these genes in breast cancer. A risk model was developed using random forest, stepAIC, and LASSO Cox regression analyses to predict prognosis, immune cell infiltration, immunotherapy response, and targeted drug sensitivity based on radiation-related gene expression profiles. Functional differences were assessed via Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses. We identified 133 radiation-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with 26 hub genes selected via LASSO and random forest models. Single-cell analysis revealed enrichment of radiation-related scores primarily in malignant cells. The radiation-related risk model, validated in the METABRIC dataset and an independent prognostic indicator in the TCGA-BRCA cohort, showed that low-risk patients had higher overall survival rates than high-risk patients. Risk scores correlated with immune infiltration, and low-risk patients exhibited greater immunotherapy response based on immune checkpoint gene expression. Drug sensitivity to gemcitabine, lapatinib, methotrexate, and doxorubicin varied across risk groups. To put it briefly, a strong efficient risk model was created to forecast prognosis, TME features, reactions to immunotherapy targeted medications in BRCA. This might lead to new understandings of individualized accurate treatment approaches. To facilitate clinical application, we have developed an R package and Excel-based calculator tool that enables clinicians to easily calculate patient risk scores using the 8-gene signature.

However, its comprehensive role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis and tumor immunity remains elusive. We evaluated SLC7A11 expression using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a clinical HCC cohort and analyzed its prognostic significance. A pan-cancer analysis across The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets was performed to investigate SLC7A11 genetic alterations, its impact on the tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor mutation burden (TMB), and therapy response. SLC7A11 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues, and high expression predicted poorer overall survival. Pan-cancer analysis confirmed its aberrant expression and identified a recurrent missense mutation (c.G>A) across various cancers. Elevated SLC7A11 expression correlated with higher TMB and TIDE scores, indicating a potential link to immunosuppression. It was enriched in metabolic pathways and associated with increased M0 macrophage infiltration. Furthermore, SLC7A11 expression positively correlated with response to agents including Gemcitabine and Bortezomib but conferred resistance to Cisplatin and others. Our findings establish SLC7A11 as a powerful prognostic biomarker for HCC, unveil its role in shaping an immunosuppressive TME, and highlight its value in predicting response to conventional and emerging therapies, providing a rationale for targeting SLC7A11 in future treatment strategies.",

          "abstract": "Piezo-type mechanosensitive channel component 1 (PIEZO1), a mechanically gated cation channel involved in calcium signaling, has been recognized as a potential oncogene in some cancers. However, its comprehensive pan-cancer role remains unexplored. This study used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data to analyze PIEZO1 expression profiles. Diagnostic value was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, with primary tumor samples as cases and adjacent normal tissues as controls. Prognostic value was determined through Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Clinical correlations were detected using non-parametric tests and logistic regression. Genomic alterations were identified via the cBioPortal database. Functional pathways were analyzed using the R language. The association between PIEZO1 and tumor microenvironment scores (Stromal, Immune, ESTIMATE) or immune checkpoint markers (CD274, CTLA4, LAG3, PDCD1, PDCD1LG2) were analyzed using the R language. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western Blotting (WB) were performed to quantify PIEZO1 expression in clinical specimens. Colony formation and wound healing assays assessed PIEZO1's <i>in vitro</i> effects on cancer cells, while xenograft models evaluated its <i>in vivo</i> impact on tumor growth. Our analysis revealed that PIEZO1 has diagnostic and prognostic value across different cancer types. Elevated PIEZO1 expression was associated with advanced tumor grade and stage. Genomic alterations in PIEZO1 were found in 4% of pan-cancer patients. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that PIEZO1-coexpressed genes were significantly enriched in ECM-receptor signaling, cell migration, and ion homeostasis. PIEZO1 positively correlated with tumor microenvironment scores and immune checkpoints. Experimental validation confirmed PIEZO1 overexpression in LIHC and its pro-tumorigenic role <i>in vitro</i>/<i>in vivo</i>. Our findings indicate that PIEZO1 is a promising marker for the diagnosis, prognosis, and development of targeted pan-cancer therapies.",

The present study reported a novel role for Zinc Finger E\u2011Box Binding Homeobox 2 (ZEB2) in conferring immunosuppressive activity on cancer cells, as well as the underlying molecular mechanism. ZEB2 cooperated with SP1 to upregulate transcription of <i>CD274</i> and <i>CCL2</i> by interacting with the proximal SP1 element in their promoters. ZEB2\u2011mediated programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD\u2011L1) upregulation on tumor cells inhibited T cell activation and cytokine secretion in a co\u2011culture system. ZEB2 upregulated C\u2011C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) secretion to promote migration of macrophages and drive polarization to an M2\u2011like phenotype. ZEB2 suppressed the activity of tumor\u2011infiltrating T cells in a syngeneic mouse tumor model. Furthermore, SUMOylation of ZEB2 by PC2 was required for efficient cooperation between ZEB2 and SP1, as well as for subsequent gene expression. Clinical data showed that <i>ZEB2</i> expression is associated positively with expression of <i>CD274</i> and <i>CCL2</i>. Expression of both <i>ZEB2</i> and <i>CD274</i> or <i>CBX4</i> has prognostic significance for predicting survival of colon cancer patients.

          "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest and most diverse class of membrane proteins, mediating cellular responses to a wide range of extracellular stimuli. GPCRs initiate complex intracellular signaling networks that regulate vital physiological functions and are associated with numerous diseases, including various types of cancer. Their conserved seven-transmembrane (7TM) structure enables these signaling networks by allowing interactions with multiple ligands and intracellular effectors. In several types of tumors, abnormal GPCR signaling promotes carcinogenesis by supporting immune evasion, cell proliferation, and therapeutic resistance. A significant research gap exists in fully understanding the molecular mechanisms behind pathway-specific activation and biased ligand discovery of GPCRs, which could lead to the development of more effective therapies. This review examines the complexity of GPCRs, with a focus on their role in signaling through the differential activation of pathways regulated by \u03b2-arrestin and G proteins. It discusses how targeted modulation of signaling outcomes by receptor mutants might offer therapeutic benefits in cancer treatment. The review also highlights emerging technologies, such as aptamers, PROTACs, and nanobodies, that more precisely target GPCRs. In addition to exploring receptor structure-function relationships and pathway selectivity, this review provides valuable insights into GPCR-biased signaling and its implications in cancer biology.",

          "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks among the deadliest malignancies worldwide, with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis for advanced-stage patients. The family with sequence similarity (FAM) genes are expected to be potential regulators in tumorigenesis, but their roles in HCC remain poorly understood. This study aimed to systematically investigate the expression profiles and functional roles of FAM genes in HCC. We leveraged multiple databases, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), to assess the expression patterns, prognostic implications, DNA methylation, genomic alterations, and associated tumor immune microenvironments of FAM genes. Differentially expressed genes were pinpointed using the DESeq2 package. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression and a nomogram model were employed to identify prognostic FAM genes and estimate the survival outcomes for HCC patients. We performed tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry on samples from 48 HCC patients to evaluate <i>FAM50A</i> expression. <i>FAM50A</i> was also knocked down in HCC cell lines to investigate its biological functions. Five overexpressed and signature-related FAM genes (<i>FAM50A</i>, <i>FAM83D</i>, <i>FAM104B</i>, <i>FAM220A</i>, and <i>FAM222B</i>) were identified and validated at both mRNA and protein levels. Elevated FAM50A expression was linked to advanced tumor stage, higher grade, and unfavorable prognosis. The constructed prognostic nomogram accurately predicted 1- and 3-year survival outcomes based on tumor stage, status, and <i>FAM50A</i> expression levels. Pathways enriched in <i>FAM50A</i> co-expressed genes included RNA processing, oxidative phosphorylation, and cell cycle regulation. Additionally, <i>FAM50A</i> expression was associated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint activity. Knockdown of <i>FAM50A</i> led to the suppression of HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This study identifies five FAM genes with prognostic relevance in HCC, among which FAM50A emerges as a potential independent prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.",

During cancer initiation, disease progression, and tumor metastasis, various genomic and proteomic alterations are observed. Recent technological advances have led to the generation of large amounts of molecular data, including genomics and transcriptomics. These large-scale datasets can be utilized to analyze and identify sub-class-specific cancer biomarkers and targets. However, there is a need for the development of user-friendly tools for large-scale data analysis, disseminating the analyzed data in a visualizable format to cancer researchers with no programming skills. We developed UALCAN, a comprehensive platform that allows users to integrate disparate data to better understand the genes, proteins, and pathways perturbed in cancer and make discoveries of potential biomarkers and targets. In the current study, we describe the development of the UALCAN Mobile application (app) that will provide cancer transcriptomic data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to evaluate protein-coding gene expression based on various stratifications, including stage, grade, race, gender, and molecular-subtypes across over 30 types of cancers. In addition, the UALCAN mobile provides data analysis options for epigenetic changes due to DNA promoter methylation and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) cancer proteomic data. The app provides access to large cancer molecular datasets on the go. To find changes in the expression of causative genes and proteins and to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets, UALCAN mobile app will be extremely valuable.

          "abstract": "Proper control of mTOR (mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling is relevant for health, disease and ageing. Information from intra- and extra-cellular signaling cues is transmitted to mTOR through an intricate signaling network that impinges on the Rag and Rheb GTPases to regulate its localization and activity. Interestingly, although mTOR is a heavily ubiquitinated protein, the role of this post-translational modification (PTM) in regulating its activation status remains poorly understood. Here, through an unbiased RNAi screen, we identified the tumor suppressor CYLD deubiquitinase (DUB) as a direct negative regulator of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities. Mechanistically, CYLD interacts with mTOR and removes non-degradative, K63-linked ubiquitin (Ub) chains from multiple of its residues. Consequently, CYLD loss-of-function cells are characterized by mTORC1/2 hyperactivation, elevated rates of protein synthesis, increased cell size, and resistance to serum-starvation-induced activation of cell death pathways. Moreover, silencing of <i>cyld-1</i>, the <i>C. elegans</i> CYLD ortholog, fully reverses the extended lifespan of low-TORC1-activity mutant worms. Finally, we find that inactivation of CYLD is associated with hyperactivation of mTORC1 also in skin biopsies from <i>CYLD</i> cutaneous syndrome (CCS) patients. In sum, our findings highlight CYLD as a sentinel of mTOR hyperactivation via direct control of its ubiquitination, and suggest that dysregulated mTOR activity may contribute to the development and progression of CCS tumors.",

Drug sensitivity profiling and molecular docking techniques have been employed to identify potential anti-cancer compounds targeting MDH1.

MDH1 expression levels are elevated across a wide range of malignancies, and overexpression of MDH1 was consistently linked to poor prognosis in multiple cancer subtypes. Moreover, MDH1 expression shows complex correlations with various immune cell populations, particularly macrophages, and cohort analysis of both bulk and pan-cancer single-cell immunotherapy data suggest that MDH1 could serve as a predictive marker for immunotherapy responses. Moreover, knockdown of MDH1 suppresses macrophage invasion. To investigate the role of MDH1 in LUAD cells, a potential inhibitor of MDH1 was identified, BI-2536, and has been confirmed to impact MDH1 activity and impede the growth of LUAD cells.

Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), namely, syndecan-1 (SDC1), SDC2, and SDC4, are involved in cancer progression, metastasis, and regulate extracellular vesicles (EVs) biogenesis, including the microvesicles (MVs). This study analyzed MV-enriched EVs isolated from blood plasma of BC patients with negative (n\u2009=\u200919) and positive (n\u2009=\u200920) LNM (nLNM and pLNM, respectively) using differential centrifugation. Western blot analysis revealed significantly elevated SDC2 levels in MV-enriched EVs from pLNM cases compared to nLNM. Additionally, fibronectin (FN), a SDC2-interacting protein identified through STRING analysis, was also upregulated in pLNM MV-enriched EVs. In contrast, qRT-PCR showed reduced SDC2 (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and FN (P\u2009<\u20090.05) mRNA levels in tumor tissues of pLNM patients compared to nLNM.

          "abstract": "Oligometastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) represents a heterogeneous entity that can, in select cases, be managed with primary tumor resection and complete local treatment at all metastatic sites, rendering a patient metastatic with no evidence of disease (M1 NED). M1 NED patients have improved overall survival, although previous cohorts are relatively small and heterogeneous. We sought to identify the natural history of M1 NED ccRCC to clinical trial findings and to optimize management strategies. Patients with synchronous metastatic ccRCC treated with local therapy alone and considered radiographically M1 NED at our institution between 1989 and 2023 were retrospectively evaluated. Survival probabilities used a combination of Kaplan-Meier estimator, log-rank test, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. When available, limited genomic data obtained using the MSK-IMPACT targeted panel was correlated with outcomes. 85 patients met inclusion criteria. One-year disease free survival (DFS) was 53% (95% CI: 42 to 63%). Sarcomatoid features predicted shorter DFS (HR 2.62, CI: 1.08, 6.34, P = 0.03). Time from first disease recurrence to second recurrence was longer among patients with initial DFS \u22652 years (median 42 vs. 15 months, log-rank P = 0.005). A total of 18 patients (21%) underwent targeted genomic sequencing; higher fraction of genome altered and CDKN2A copy number loss were associated with shorter DFS. Findings were limited by cohort size. Most M1 NED ccRCC patients will experience disease recurrence, although certain baseline risk factors appear to predict earlier recurrence. Prognostic biomarkers are needed to predict outcomes and facilitate patient management.",

However, regulatory mechanisms controlling sphingolipid and ganglioside biosynthesis in mammalian cells are less known. Here, we show that RICTOR, the regulatory subunit of mTORC2, regulates the synthesis of sphingolipids and gangliosides in human luminal breast cancer-specific MCF-7 and BT-474 cells through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms. We observe that RICTOR regulates glucosylceramide levels by modulating the expression of UDP-Glucose Ceramide Glucosyl transferase (UGCG). We identify Zinc Finger protein X-linked (ZFX) as a RICTOR-responsive transcription factor whose recruitment to the UGCG promoter is regulated by DNA methyltransferase 1 and histone demethylase (KDM5A), which are known AKT substrates. We further demonstrate that RICTOR regulates the synthesis of GD3 gangliosides through ZFX and UGCG, and triggers the activation of the EGFR signaling pathway, thereby promoting tumor growth. In line with our findings in human cell culture and mouse models, we observe an elevated expression of RICTOR, ZFX, and UGCG in Indian luminal breast cancer tissues and in TCGA and METABRIC datasets. Together, we establish a key regulatory circuit, RICTOR-AKT-ZFX-UGCG-Ganglioside-EGFR-AKT, and elucidate its contribution to breast cancer progression.",

          "abstract": "Despite progress in research and treatment strategies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the prognosis for patients with AML, particularly for individuals aged >60 years and those with adverse risk factors, remains poor. Cellular receptors that affect cholesterol homeostasis may present a new target for treating AML. Scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1), which plays an important role in cellular cholesterol uptake and redox balance, is expressed by AML cells and correlates with poor patient outcomes. Previously, we targeted SR-B1 in various hematologic and solid malignancies with a synthetic bioinspired high-density lipoprotein nanoparticle (HDL NP) ligand that disrupted cholesterol metabolism, inhibited protective antioxidant mechanisms, and induced ferroptosis. This study demonstrates that HDL NPs are effective at low nanomolar drug concentrations in AML, surpassing the effectiveness of cytarabine, a standard-of-care chemotherapy agent. The HDL NP reduced glutathione peroxidase 4, leading to reactive oxygen species accumulation, which causes some AML cells to undergo ferroptosis while others undergo apoptosis and pyroptosis. HDL NP treatment was synergistic with standard AML therapies, including cytarabine, venetoclax, and gilteritinib for fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-mutated leukemia cells. Notably, HDL NP treatment induced the differentiation of AML cells into mature granulocytes. Overall, this study provides a foundation for further investigations into the underlying mechanisms and clinical applications of SR-B1 targeting in AML treatment.",

We analysed tumour samples, either from locoregional lesions or distant metastases, from patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma from the SAFIR02-Lung trial by targeted sequencing of 45 cancer genes and comparative genomic hybridisation array and compared them to early tumours samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Differences in copy-number alterations frequencies suggest the involvement in tumour progression of LAMB3, TNN/KIAA0040/TNR, KRAS, DAB2, MYC, EPHA3 and VIPR2, and in metastatic dissemination of AREG, ZNF503, PAX8, MMP13, JAM3, and MTURN. Conversely, no meaningful difference was found in pathogenic single-nucleotide variant frequencies, reinforcing the notion that they are early events in tumorigenesis. CDKN2A homozygous deletion was linked to poor clinical outcome in patients with early tumours (overall survival hazard ratio 2.17, 95% CI: 1.43-3.28, corrected p-value\u2009=\u20090.01). Furthermore, we found that KRAS mutant allele specific imbalance, i.e. focal amplification of the mutant allele, is more prevalent in locoregional or distant samples of metastatic patients than in early lesions (8.4%, 13% and 2.8% respectively). This observation was replicated in three public cohorts. Tumours with KRAS mutant allele specific imbalance show specific patterns of co-occurrence and mutual exclusion with alterations in key cancer genes like CDKN2A, TP53, STK11 and NKX2-1, often in a tumour type dependent manner. Advanced LUAD tumours exhibit higher copy-number alteration burden, with distinct alterations associated with tumour progression and metastasis. CDKN2A homozygous deletions predict poor prognosis in early disease, while KRAS mutant allele-specific imbalance is enriched in advanced tumours.",

The association between obesity (body mass index [BMI], \u226530) and biologic sex (male or female) for outcomes in patients with PDAC undergoing a surgery-first approach was investigated. A prospectively maintained pancreatic cancer database at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center was queried to identify all patients undergoing surgery with a pathologic diagnosis of PDAC. Clinicodemographic variables, outcomes, and tumor mutational analyses for all available patients were collected. Cumulative incidence of first recurrence involving the liver was estimated via a cumulative incidence function. Multivariable Cox regression was used to investigate the association between BMI and sex for overall survival. From 2012 to 2022, 939 patients were identified who underwent surgery with a final pathologic diagnosis of PDAC. Median age was 70 years, 52% were male, and 24% were obese (BMI, \u226530). When dichotomized by sex and obesity status (BMI, <30 or \u226530), females with obesity had the lowest cumulative incidence of liver recurrence at 12 and 24 months postsurgery compared to all other groups (13% [95% CI, 7.2%-20%] and 15% [8.7%-23%], respectively). Females with obesity had the longest median overall survival at 37 months. After curative surgery for pancreatic cancer, females with obesity have a significantly lower rate of liver recurrence and the longest median overall survival. This does not appear to be related to surgical quality, receipt of adjuvant therapy, or tumor mutational profile. Investigation into host immune, metabolic, and hormonal parameters is paramount to understanding these differences.",

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) constitutes the most abundant RNA modification, modulates RNA biology/metabolism, and maintains cellular homeostasis, with its dysregulation involved in cancer initiation and progression. Herein, we evaluated the clinical value of METTL3 m6A methyltransferase, the main catalytic component of m6A methylation machinery, in improving BlCa patients' risk stratification and prognosis. The screening cohort of the study included 213 patients. The UROMOL (n\u2009=\u2009535) was analyzed as a validation cohort for non-muscle-invasive BlCa (NMIBC), while the TCGA-BLCA (n\u2009=\u2009412) and Mariathasan et al. (n\u2009=\u2009348) cohorts were analyzed for muscle-invasive BlCa (MIBC). Disease recurrence/progression and patients' mortality were assessed as clinical endpoints for NMIBC and MIBC, respectively. Internal validation of Cox regression models was conducted using bootstrap analysis, while the clinical utility for patient prognosis was evaluated through decision curve analysis. Reduced METTL3 expression was correlated with muscle-invasive disease and tumors of advanced stage. Loss of METTL3 expression at diagnosis was strongly associated with higher risk of short-term progression (HR\u2009=\u20092.903, 95% CI: 1.303-6.464, p\u2009=\u20090.006) to invasive stages in NMIBC and with worse survival of MIBC patients (HR\u2009=\u20091.908, 95% CI: 1.020-3.567, p\u2009=\u20090.042). Consistently, validation cohorts confirmed the poor treatment outcomes in patients exhibiting loss of METTL3. Finally, METTL3-fitted multivariate models improved risk stratification and offered superior clinical benefit for NMIBC and MIBC prognostication compared to clinically established disease markers. Overall, loss of METTL3 expression correlates with inferior treatment outcomes in BlCa, driving more accurate risk stratification and ameliorating patients' prognosis in BlCa.",

The patients were divided into long-term and short-term response groups according to progression-free survival (PFS) time, treatment lines and regimens. The next-generation sequencing (NGS) results of these patients were analyzed to identify biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of trastuzumab-containing therapies. Next, the cBioPortal database and LAVA database were screened to explore molecular profiling data.

However, no systematic studies have been conducted on BYSL value in pan-cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and immunology. We performed a pan-cancer analysis of BYSL using TCGA, GEO, and other databases to assess its expression, clinical significance, genetic variants, methylation, and immune correlation. Enrichment analysis was applied to predict BYSL-related pathways. We analyzed BYSL protein levels in corresponding breast cancer (BRCA) tissue samples to validate our findings using Western blot assays. A tissue microarray was deployed to verify BYSL expression in BRCA tissues by immunohistochemical staining. Moreover, we comprehensively analyzed the function of BYSL in BRCA initiation and development through CCK-8, transwell invasion, migration assays, and cell scratch assays for migration ability assessment. Through the study, BYSL was significantly overexpressed in the majority of cancers relative to normal tissues, with different expression patterns at different clinicopathological stages. In most cancer types, BYSL exhibits moderate to high diagnostic value, and overexpressed BYSL represents an independent prognosis factor in patients having BRCA, HNSC, KICH, LIHC, OV, and SARC cancers. Mutations in BYSL are distributed in most cancers and are related to prognosis. Most tumors have elevated levels of m6A methylation compared to normal tissues, while their promoter regions exhibit low levels of methylation. Additionally, BYSL expression displayed a positive correlation with MDSC immune infiltration. Further enrichment analysis showed the involvement of BYSL in important biological processes (BP), In addition, BYSL was overexpressed in BRCA tissues and promoted their proliferation, invasion, and migration compared to matched normal breast tissues. Our study showed that BYSL is an important biological indicator for predicting pan-cancer survival outcomes and immune characteristics and elucidated BYSL expression and role in BRCA, which highlights its therapeutic potential in BRCA.",

          "abstract": "Structural maintenance of chromosome 2 (SMC2) has been recognized to play an important role in a variety of cancers, but its function in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains poorly understood. Our research utilized various databases and analytical tools such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, TIMER 2.0, TISIDB, cBioportal, Gene Ontology, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, for analyzing SMC2 expression, prognosis significance, immune features and gene alterations in LUAD. In addition, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry were used to detect SMC2 expression in LUAD. The clinical data of 70 patients with LUAD in Hunan Provincial People's Hospital were analyzed. SMC2 was markedly upregulated in LUAD cell lines and tissues and was strongly correlated with adverse clinicopathological features and prognosis. The enrichment analysis suggested that SMC2 might be involved in the regulation of LUAD cell cycle. The TIMER algorithm and single-sample GSEA algorithm showed that SMC2 was associated with suppressive immune cells (for example, B cells) in LUAD. In addition, SMC2 may interact with the expression of poor prognostic molecules to promote LUAD progression. Evidence from the TISIDB database revealed that SMC2 is positively associated with immunosuppressive genes. However, it is inversely associated with chemokines and receptors. Also, as predicted by the tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion algorithm, patients with high SMC2 expression responded poorly to immunotherapy. These findings suggest that SMC2 is associated with the malignant progression of LUAD and therefore may be a potential target for improving outcomes in LUAD in the foreseeable future.",

Genetic alterations acquired during the evolution of CRPC may affect antitumor immunity and immunotherapy responses, which could inform personalized therapeutic strategies. Using our innovative electroporation-based mouse models, we generated distinct genetic subtypes of CRPC found in patients and uncovered unique immune microenvironments. Specifically, mouse and human prostate tumors with MYC amplification and p53 disruption had weak cytotoxic lymphocyte infiltration and an overall dismal prognosis. MYC and p53 cooperated to induce tumor-intrinsic secretion of VEGF, which signaled through VEGFR2 expressed on CD8+ T cells to directly inhibit T-cell migration and effector functions. Targeting VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling in vivo remodeled the immunosuppressive prostate tumor microenvironment, leading to CD8+ T-cell-mediated primary tumor and metastasis growth suppression and significantly increased overall survival in MYC- and p53-altered CRPC. VEGFR2 blockade also led to the induction of PD-L1 in tumors and produced antitumor efficacy in combination with PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade in multiple preclinical CRPC mouse models. Thus, these results identify a genetic mechanism of immunosuppression through VEGF signaling in prostate cancer that can be targeted to reactivate immune and immunotherapy responses in an aggressive subtype of CRPC. VEGFR2 blockade inhibits VEGF-mediated T-cell suppression and potentiates the effects of PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer driven by MYC and p53 alterations.",

Based on bioinformatics analysis of multi-omics data, we firstly demonstrated that YRDC was markedly overexpressed and associated with worse prognosis in various tumors. Further, our results indicated that genetic alterations, copy number variations, and methylation levels of YRDC might explain the different YRDC expression between tumors and controls.

Notably, YRDC emerged as a potential biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response and targeted drug efficacy.

This study employed bioinformatics analyses, small interfering RNA (siRNA) screening, small molecule inhibition, and quantitative imaging (QuantIM) microscopy to identify synthetic lethal interactors of <i>FBXO7</i>. Shallow deletions of <i>FBXO7</i> in CRC patient samples was found to associate with decreased gene expression and adverse clinical outcomes. Targeted silencing or pharmacological inhibition of CHEK1 using Prexasertib significantly reduced proliferation in <i>FBXO7</i>-deficient cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that Prexasertib treatment increased DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis specifically in <i>FBXO7</i>-deficient cells. Furthermore, combining Prexasertib with 5-fluorouracil, a standard chemotherapeutic agent, produced a synergistic killing effect.

Data from six databases, including UCSC Xena, TCGA, GTEx, TIMER2.0, GEPIA, and cBioPortal, were analyzed to assess ANGPT2 expression in pan-cancer. Immunohistochemical images were sourced from the HPA database. We explored the correlation between ANGPT2 expression and prognosis, diagnostic value, genetic alterations, and immune cell infiltration in cancers. Functional enrichment and gene set enrichment analyses were performed to uncover the biological roles of ANGPT2. Additionally, miRWalk, miRDB, Starbase 2.0 ENCORI, and Cytoscape were utilized to identify and construct the lncRNA-miRNA-ANGPT2 ceRNA regulatory network in SKCM. Our comprehensive pan-cancer analysis revealed that ANGPT2 undergoes genetic alterations in several tumor types, including mutations, amplifications, and deep deletions. ANGPT2 expression varies across cancers, with high levels detected in 21 tumor types. ANGPT2 demonstrated significant diagnostic and prognostic value in various cancers. Genes related to ANGPT2 in cancers with high expression were found to be involved in critical pathways such as tumor angiogenesis, growth factor signaling, extracellular matrix (ECM) structure, and cell surface receptor activation. In addition, ANGPT2 was found to modulate the immune microenvironment in multiple tumors, promoting immune evasion and contributing to tumor progression, particularly in SKCM. A lncRNA-miRNA-ANGPT2 ceRNA regulatory network was identified, which may play a role in SKCM progression. ANGPT2 demonstrates potential as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, with evidence suggesting its involvement in immune microenvironment regulation and associated gene networks. Therapeutic approaches targeting ANGPT2, either as a stand-alone treatment or in combination with immunotherapies, could offer new and effective strategies for future cancer treatments.",

          "abstract": "While cervical cancer (CC) is increasingly detected at earlier stages due to improved screening, clinical dilemmas persist in stratifying precancerous lesions and managing advanced disease. Major histocompatibility complex-related genes (MHCRGs), which regulate antigen presentation and immune surveillance, may serve as promising biomarkers for prognosis and therapeutic guidance in CC. We identified MHCRGs via literature review and constructed a prognostic signature using LASSO and multivariate Cox regression based on TCGA-CESC data. Bioinformatic analyses assessed associations between the MHCRG signature, immune cell infiltration, immunotherapy response, and drug sensitivity. Validation was conducted using external GEO datasets (GSE29570, GSE63514), and further confirmed through qRT-PCR and Western blot in clinical CC samples. Functional assays, including gene knockdown in CC cell lines, were performed to explore the biological roles of key MHCRGs in tumor progression. A five-gene signature (CANX, HLA-DMB, HLA-DPB1, PSMB6, PSMB7) was identified as predictive of prognosis, immune infiltration, and therapeutic responsiveness. CANX was significantly upregulated, while HLA-DMB and HLA-DPB1 were downregulated in high-risk groups across all datasets and clinical tissues. qRT-PCR and WB results aligned with bioinformatic predictions. Functional experiments demonstrated that silencing CANX suppressed CC cell proliferation and invasion. These findings support the oncogenic role of CANX and the immune-regulatory potential of the other MHCRGs. The MHCscore remained an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis. We propose a robust MHCRG-based gene signature, validated through both bioinformatic analyses and in vitro functional experiments. These findings offer translational potential for improving risk stratification and guiding immunotherapy in CC patients.",

Recent studies have identified the ubiquitin-associated and SH3 domain-containing B (UBASH3B), a tyrosine phosphatase, as a key oncogenic player in HNSCC pathogenesis. Elevated UBASH3B expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes in HNSCC patients. Mechanistically, UBASH3B promotes tumor progression by stabilizing the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) levels, thereby enhancing downstream signaling pathways that promote cancer cell proliferation, survival, and therapeutic resistance. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the structural features and physiological functions of UBASH3B, along with a focused discussion on its emerging role in HNSCC tumorigenesis. We further explore the potential of targeting UBASH3B as a novel therapeutic target, underscoring its promise in reshaping treatment paradigms. Elucidating the molecular functions of UBASH3B in HNSCC may uncover new vulnerabilities and pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies that target its activity.",

However, assessing potential FASLG expression in tumor cells with convenient genomics approaches has been challenging. This study applied a novel assessment of FASLG copy numbers (CNs) and gene expression levels, applicable to bulk exome and RNAseq files. Analyses indicated high FASLG CN associated with worse survival outcomes. Interestingly, higher FASLG gene expression was found to be associated with better survival outcomes, which led to a determination of whether this result was due to FASLG expression from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) instead of cancer cells demonstrating the higher CNs. In fact, T-cell markers CD4 and CD8A highly correlated with FASLG expression, consistent with the hypothesis that the high FASLG expression was associated with the TILs. Subsequent analyses confirmed that CN increases led to increased gene expression in the genomic region of the FASLG gene, particularly with an assessment of the expression of the neighboring PRRC2C gene. In sum, FASLG CN assessments, even independently of a corresponding gene expression correlation, may provide important characterizations of tumor cells. This study indicates that FASLG CN increases could represent a mechanism of tumor escape from TILs and a prognostic indicator; and tumor FASLG may be a suitable drug target for reducing tumor evasion of T-cells.",

          "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Despite advances in prostate cancer treatment, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains clinically challenging due to inherent therapy resistance and a lack of durable alternatives. Although traditional Chinese medicine offers untapped potential, the therapeutic role of paeoniflorin (Pae), a bioactive compound derived from Paeonia lactiflora, in prostate cancer has yet to be investigated. <b>Methods:</b> Using an integrative approach (network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experimental validation), we identified Pae key targets, constructed protein-protein interaction networks, and performed GO/KEGG pathway analyses. A Pae-target-based prognostic model was developed and validated. In vitro and in vivo assays assessed Pae effects on proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis, and tumor growth. <b>Results:</b> Pae exhibited potent anti-CRPC activity, inhibiting cell proliferation by 60% and impairing cell migration by 65% compared to controls. Mechanistically, Pae downregulated SRC proto-oncogene, non-receptor tyrosine kinase (SRC) mRNA expression by 68%. The Pae-target-based prognostic model stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct survival outcomes. Organoid and xenograft studies confirmed Pae-mediated tumor growth inhibition and SRC downregulation. <b>Conclusions:</b> Pae overcomes CRPC resistance by targeting SRC-mediated pathways, presenting a promising therapeutic strategy. Our findings underscore the utility of network pharmacology-guided drug discovery and advocate for further clinical exploration of Pae in precision oncology.",

          "abstract": "Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), while often having a favorable prognosis, can progress to aggressive forms. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are crucial in extracellular matrix remodeling and are implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. This study investigated MMP expression and activity in PTC and the efficacy of two selective MMP inhibitors in suppressing PTC cell migration and invasion. The analysis of RNA-seq data from the TCGA-THCA dataset highlighted the overexpression of MMP-14 in PTC, a key upstream activator of several MMPs, including MMP-2 and, indirectly, MMP-9. This elevation correlated with disease status and recurrence risk. Validation in a cell model, using PTC lines (K1 and BCPAP) and non-tumoral thyroid cells (Nthy-ori 3-1), showed markedly increased MMP-14 activity in PTC lines (6-fold in K1; 11-fold in BCPAP). MMP-9 activity was also substantially elevated (386-fold in K1; 131-fold in BCPAP), along with increased MMP-2 activity. We then tested selective inhibitors. NSC405020, an MMP-14 inhibitor, reduced K1 cell migration by 56.52% and invasion by 67.3%. Gallic acid, an MMP-2 and MMP-9 inhibitor, reduced K1 cell migration to 60.3% and invasion to 33.3% relative to the controls. These findings suggest that elevated MMP activity is a hallmark of aggressive PTC, underscoring MMPs' role in cancer progression. Targeting MMPs, particularly with agents like NSC405020 and gallic acid, presents a promising therapeutic strategy to disrupt PTC tumor progression.",

Conversely, <i>BRAF</i> V600E mutation in thyroid cancer was not associated with increased expression nor MAPK pathway activation. No significant difference in overall survival based on <i>BRAF</i> mutation was observed in the subset of patients where data was available.

Aggressive triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) lack an effective therapy; thus, inactivating YAP and TAZ has emerged as an attractive approach and a new treatment modality. Thus, we performed two complementary high-throughput RNAi-based kinome screens to uncover cancer-associated activators of YAP/TAZ in two TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB468. Integrated analysis that combined a YAP/TAZ localization screen with a TEAD-luciferase reporter screen, identified novel regulators including BRSK1, STK32C and STK40. The AMPK family members NUAKs, MARKs and SIKs are known to inhibit the Hippo kinase cassette; here, we uncover BRSK1, another AMPK family member as a regulator of YAP/TAZ. We also reveal that two poorly studied kinases, STK32C, a member of the AGC family, and STK40, a pseudokinase, can also inhibit the activity of YAP/TAZ. Thus, our studies expand the repertoire of known AMPK family members and reveal two new kinases that modulate the Hippo pathway and may play a role in YAP/TAZ driven breast cancers. Further analysis of other screen hits may similarly uncover new regulators that could be targeted for therapeutic interventions.",

Regardless of tissue of origin, many carcinomas show luminal or basal traits that are reflected in molecular profiles and are associated with different clinical behaviors and outcomes. Traditionally, cancers have been classified by histology and anatomical site, but accumulating evidence indicates that luminal/basal subtyping reflects shared biological programs that transcend organ boundaries. Breast cancer was the first model in which these subtypes were defined, revealing clear prognostic and therapeutic implications. Subsequent studies have identified similar subtypes in bladder, lung, prostate, pancreatic, and head and neck carcinomas, where basal phenotypes are consistently associated with aggressive disease and distinct vulnerabilities to treatment. In this review, we synthesize advances from the last decade (2010-2024) on the basal-like subtype across epithelial tumors. We summarize key studies applying luminal/basal subtyping in large cohorts of carcinomas and in single tissue tumor types. By integrating these findings, we aim to clarify the current understanding of luminal and basal subtypes in epithelial tumors and outline their potential to refine cancer classification, improve prognostic accuracy, and guide therapeutic decision-making. This perspective supports a biology-driven framework for cancer classification and treatment, moving beyond traditional histological boundaries.",

Investigating EphA2's impact on the host immune system may advance our understanding of tumor immune evasion and the consequences of targeting EphA2 on the tumor microenvironment. Here, we examine how tumor-specific EphA2 affects the activation and infiltration of immune cell populations and the cytokine and chemokine milieu in murine models of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although EphA2 overexpression in NSCLC cells did not display proliferative advantage in vitro, it conferred a growth advantage in vivo. Analysis of lung tumor infiltrates via flow cytometry revealed decreased natural killer and T cells in the EphA2-overexpressing tumors, as well as increased myeloid populations, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). T-cell activation, particularly in CD8+ T cells, was decreased, while PD-1 expression was increased. These changes were accompanied by increased monocyte-attracting chemokines, specifically CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, and CCL12, and immunosuppressive proteins TGF-\u03b2 and arginase 1 in RNA expression analyses. Our studies suggest EphA2 on tumor cells recruits monocytes and promotes their differentiation into TAMs that likely inhibit the activation and infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes, promoting tumor immune escape.",

Understanding these differences is vital for identifying therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers. We performed an integrative multi-omics analysis combining proteomics, phosphoproteomics, metabolomics, and RNA sequencing data from adult and pediatric thyroid cancer cohorts. Differential expression analyses were conducted for all the multi-omics data with false discovery rate adjustments. Enzyme mapping of metabolites was performed using MetaBridge, while cross-omics integration revealed 46 key genes associated with reprogrammed energy metabolism. Clinical relevance was evaluated through survival analyses on cBioPortal and KM plotter platforms, and immunotherapy responses were assessed based on gene expression profiles. The 46 identified genes, primarily involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation, were strongly associated with poor disease-free and overall survival in PTC and ATC patients. In ATC, a high tumor mutation burden correlated with worse outcomes, underscoring its prognostic value. Additionally, seven genes (AK2, SUCLG2, NDUFV2, GLUD1, HADHA, ALDH1A1, and NADSYN1) were linked to improved responses to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, highlighting their potential as biomarkers for treatment stratification. Furthermore, functional studies reveal that AK2 plays a key role in thyroid cancer progression.

Previous studies have reported SGO1's regulatory roles in isolated cancer types, but its pan-cancer significance and underlying mechanisms remain undefined. This study systematically investigates SGO1 in 33 cancer types, integrating multi-omics analyses and functional validation to reveal its role as a pan-cancer biomarker and therapeutic target. Using TCGA, GEPIA2, and HPA databases, we found SGO1 was significantly overexpressed in 19 cancer types compared to normal tissues. High SGO1 expression correlated with poorer overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in more than 10 cancers, validated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Genomic analysis revealed frequent SGO1 mutations and DNA methylation dysregulation, while immune profiling showed associations with immune cell infiltration (B cells, CD8+ T cells) and PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint genes. Protein-protein interaction and enrichment analyses uncovered BUB1 as a key co-expressed gene, suggesting a role in spindle checkpoint regulation. Functional assays in breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and lung cancer cell line A549 showed SGO1 knockdown inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion, with xenograft models confirming reduced tumor growth. Our findings establish SGO1 as a novel pan-cancer biomarker, linking its expression to tumor progression, immune evasion, and genomic instability.

However, few studies focused on the relationship between <i>RNF43</i> and co-mutation characteristics and prognosis. This study aims to explore the different prognostic subtypes of <i>RNF43</i>-mutated CRC by analyzing the association of clinicopathological and genomic characteristics with survival outcomes. The clinical characteristics, mutational characteristics, and survival data of CRC patients were obtained for <i>RNF43</i>-mutated analysis from cBioPortal. All mutation data were filtered by the 1021-panel (Geneplus-Beijing, China), and the processed data were used to analyze the predictive value of <i>RNF43</i>-mutated to OS and concomitant co-mutations. Cox regression analysis was selected to explore prognostic biomarkers, and finally, <i>BRAF</i> and MSI were selected for subgroup analysis. The independent validation cohort comprised 339 cases of stage IV CRC from Beijing Hospital. 11 datasets with 4028 patient data were screened for this study. The most common variant was frameshift, which occurred in codon 659-mutated of exon 9, including <i>RNF43</i> p.G659Vfs*41 (N=116) and <i>RNF43</i> p.G659Sfs*87 (N=2). <i>RNF43</i> codon 659-mutated occurred frequently in right-sided CRC (59.32%, N=70, P<0.0001), and rarely in the left-sided (11.02%, N=13). The incidence of TMB-H in the <i>RNF43</i> codon 659-mutated group was 93.22% (110/118), and MSI-H was 78.81% (93/118). Univariate Cox analysis and multivariate Cox analysis showed that MSI-H was the most significantly different biomarker for better prognosis (P=0.004, HR=3, CI 1.4-6.4), and Class 1 <i>BRAF</i> V600E was the most different biomarker for worse prognosis (P<0.001, HR=0.3, CI 0.21-0.42). <i>RNF43</i> codon 659-mutated with non-class 1 <i>BRAF</i>-mutated or MSI-H suggests a better prognosis in CRC. We found that G1 (<i>RNF43</i> codon 659-mutated, non-class 1 <i>BRAF</i>-mutated, and MSl-H) had a better PFS and OS. The mutation difference analysis showed that the core genes related to the cancer signaling pathway (PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MicroRNAs pathway, DNA damage repair, and tumor suppressor genes) were highly frequent in G1. The analysis comparing the core gene mutation difference between <i>RNF43</i>-mutated and wild-type in the validation cohort yielded consistent conclusions. In CRC, we found that the G1 cohort had the best prognosis, and patients with <i>RNF43</i> Non-codon 659-mutated, <i>BRAF</i> V600E and MSS had the worst prognosis. This may provide clinical value for patients' further accurate prognosis prediction, curative effect prediction, and follow-up management of patients.",

Our data support that ASPN bound directly to the ligand binding domain of human epidermal growth factor 3 (HER3) and induced HER2/HER3 heterodimerization and activation of the PI3K, MAPK, and calcium pathways. Genetic and therapeutic inhibition of HER2/HER3 ablated ASPN-induced signaling and migration. Clinically, ASPN was detected in the stroma of HER2/HER3-expressing human metastatic prostate cancer, supporting the clinical relevance of these findings and highlighting a potential therapeutic vulnerability. Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapies designed to target HER2 (trastuzumab-deruxtecan) or HER3 (patritumab-deruxtecan) significantly diminished prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and tumor size in vivo, despite Aspn in the TME. Collectively, these findings indicate ASPN functions as a HER3 ligand to induce cellular migration, and inhibition with anti-HER2 or anti-HER3 ADC therapies highlights potential clinical utility for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that expresses HER2 or HER3.",

Some NSCLCs, particularly adenocarcinomas, harbour genomic alterations in receptor tyrosine kinases or downstream RAS/RAF signalling pathways, which are targets of effective therapies. NSCLCs lacking actionable genomic alterations often benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors, though only a minority of patients achieve long-term survival. These tumours often carry alterations in tumour suppressor genes like TP53, KEAP1, STK11, or NF1, for which pharmacological strategies are still under investigation. This review explores emerging therapeutic opportunities unveiled by multi-omics studies in NSCLCs without actionable genomic alterations. Proteogenomic approaches-integrating genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data-enable a comprehensive understanding of NSCLC molecular landscapes and signalling network dysregulation, helping to identify distinct tumour subtypes and potential therapeutic targets. These tumours exhibit alterations in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, immune signalling, epigenetic modulation and metabolic and redox pathways. Although therapies targeting tumour suppressor genes like p53 remain highly anticipated, extending our understanding of the broader molecular landscape in these tumours may reveal novel vulnerabilities and inform the development of novel drugs or combination strategies. This could further advance precision oncology for NSCLC.",

          "abstract": "Cancer remains the second leading cause of mortality globally, necessitating the development of novel therapeutic agents. In this work, we synthesized 34 derivatives of nitrated N-substituted-4-hydroxy-2-quinolone-3-carboxamides, which were spectroscopically analyzed using FT-IR, NMR (<sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C), and elemental analysis. Derivatives tailored with m-CF<sub>3</sub> (10), m-OCH<sub>3</sub> (13), m-Cl (16), and m-F (20) benzyl moiety exhibited distinctive cytotoxicity against human colon cancer (HCT-116) cells with IC<sub>50s</sub> of 23.41, 27.14, 28.43, and 22.95 \u00b5M. Analogue 11 showed 100% inhibitory activity against ovarian cancer (NCI/ADR-RES), colon cancer (COLO 205), CNS cancer (SF-295), and melanoma (SK-MEL-2) cells. Cheminformatics analysis further revealed insights into the physicochemical and drug-like properties of these analogues, highlighting their potential to bind PI3K\u03b1 through alignment with key pharmacophoric features required for effective enzyme interaction. Molecular docking studies against both wild-type and mutant PI3K\u03b1 elucidated binding interactions, suggesting that specific substituents enhance selectivity and potency. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of quinolone derivatives in targeting cancer-related pathways and contributes valuable data to the ongoing search for more effective anticancer therapies.",

          "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related death, with limited response rates to immunotherapy. Identifying novel biomarkers to predict prognosis and guide treatment is urgently needed. Using TCGA-LIHC data, we identified migrasome-related long non-coding RNAs (MRlncRNAs) associated with HCC prognosis and constructed a two-lncRNA signature (LINC00839 and MIR4435-2HG) through LASSO-Cox regression. The model was validated in an independent cohort (n = 100). Multi-omics analyses were conducted to explore correlations with immune infiltration, immune checkpoints, TMB, MSI, and therapeutic sensitivity. Clinical sample validation and functional assays were performed to verify biological relevance. We knocked down MIR4435-2HG in HCC cells to assess its impact on proliferation, migration, EMT phenotype, and PD-L1 expression. The MRlncRNA signature effectively stratified HCC patients by prognosis and immunotherapy responsiveness. High-risk patients exhibited elevated immunosuppressive cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression. Functional validation revealed that MIR4435-2HG promotes malignant behaviors and immune evasion by regulating EMT and PD-L1. Single-cell analysis showed its enrichment in cancer-associated fibroblasts, suggesting a role in tumor-stroma crosstalk and immune suppression. MRlncRNAs, particularly MIR4435-2HG, contribute to HCC progression and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This study establishes a robust prognostic model and identifies potential targets for precision immunotherapy in HCC.",

SLiMs can undergo regulation through post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation. The flanking regions surrounding the core motifs also exert a crucial role for the interaction. While phosphorylation and flanking regions are known to influence SLiM function, the mechanistic basis of this regulation remains poorly understood. We integrate biomolecular simulations, in silico high-throughput mutational scans, and biophysical experiments to elucidate the phospho-regulation in SLiMs crucial for autophagy, i.e., the LC3 interacting regions (LIRs). We investigate the Optineurin LIR, which perfectly exemplifies a class of LIR with a complex interplay of phosphorylations and flanking regions. Here we show that specific phosphorylation events and flanking residues modulate binding to LC3 at the atomic level, and that disease-associated mutations alter these interactions in the phosphorylated context. Notably, we establish an approach based on Microfluidic Diffusional Sizing to investigate binding affinities of SLiMs to target proteins, complemented by Surface Plasmon Resonance, enabling precise measurements of dissociation constants and kinetics for a selection of variants. Our work provides a versatile toolkit to characterize phospho-regulated SLiMs, advancing the understanding of important cellular processes.",

There are several commercialized CGP assays with variable targeted genes, while the differences between medium- and large-sized panels in refining genomic profiling strategies, optimizing resource allocation and enhancing clinical applications require evaluation. In the present study, patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) from the Veterans General Hospital TAipei-Yung-Ling foundation sinO-canceR study were initially assayed using a medium-sized CGP panel (Oncomine comprehensive panel), and the remaining nucleic acid specimens were re-sequenced with a large-sized panel (TruSight Oncology 500). The molecular profiling between the two sequencing panels was compared. A total of 108 breast cancer samples were successfully assayed using both platforms and 272 variants were reported at least once by either type of CGP. The reported variants were among actionable genes (<i>AKT1</i>, <i>BRCA1/2</i>, <i>PALB2</i>, <i>ERBB2</i>, <i>PIK3CA</i> and <i>PTEN</i>), which can be acted upon or have clinical relevance for therapeutic intervention and <i>TP53</i>. The concordance rate between the medium- and large-sized panels was 34.6%, which was enhanced to 58.9% after excluding polymorphisms, out-of-targeted region variants and those with low variant allele frequency (#x003C;10%), with variants of <i>TP53</i>, <i>ERBB2</i> and <i>PTEN</i> being mostly enhanced. A majority of discordance came from TruSight Oncology 500-detected only variants, especially <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>BRCA2</i> and <i>PALB2</i>. In conclusion, the results indicated that only one-third of actionable mutations could be detected consistently between the medium- and large-sized CGP panels using the default analytical pipelines, while extensive bioinformatics analyses improved concordance substantially. The large-sized panel detected more variants, thereby enhancing clinical actionability. With more therapeutic targets revealed in the future, CGP may be particularly impactful in refining strategies for TNBC management.",

We evaluated the association between RIN3 levels and patient survival via univariate Cox regression and analyzed its correlation with immune cell infiltration using TIMER2.0. Additionally, GSEA and GSVA were employed to explore the involvement of RIN3 in immune responses and metabolic processes, while molecular docking and bioinformatics approaches predicted its interactions with anticancer drugs. Functional assays in breast cancer models confirmed that downregulation of RIN3 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration. Our results revealed considerable variations in RIN3 expression across tumors, an inverse relationship with CNVs and DNA methylation, and a significant correlation with immunotherapy biomarkers.

          "abstract": "Functional inactivation of tumor suppressor genes drives cancer initiation, progression, and treatment responses. Most tumor suppressor genes are inactivated through 1 of 2 well-characterized mechanisms: DNA-level mutations, such as point mutations or deletions, and promoter DNA hypermethylation. Here, we report a distinct third mechanism of tumor suppressor inactivation based on alterations to the histone rather than DNA code. We demonstrated that PAX2 is an endometrial tumor suppressor recurrently inactivated by a distinct epigenetic reprogramming event in more than 80% of human endometrial cancers. Integrative transcriptomic, epigenomic, 3D genomic, and machine learning analyses showed that PAX2 transcriptional downregulation is associated with replacement of open/active chromatin features (H3K27ac/H3K4me3) with inaccessible/repressive chromatin features (H3K27me3) in a framework dictated by 3D genome organization. The spread of the repressive H3K27me3 signal resembled a pearl necklace, with its length modulated by cohesin loops, thereby preventing transcriptional dysregulation of neighboring genes. This mechanism, involving the loss of a promoter-proximal superenhancer, was shown to underlie transcriptional silencing of PAX2 in human endometrial cancers. Mouse and human preclinical models established PAX2 as a potent endometrial tumor suppressor. Functionally, PAX2 loss promoted endometrial carcinogenesis by rewiring the transcriptional landscape via global enhancer reprogramming. The discovery that most endometrial cancers originate from a recurring epigenetic alteration carries profound implications for their diagnosis and treatment.",

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of TOPK expression and its association with immune infiltration in KIRC by integrating bioinformatics, in vitro, and in vivo approaches. We found that TOPK is significantly overexpressed in KIRC and serves as an independent prognostic marker correlated with aberrant promoter methylation. High TOPK expression was associated with reduced infiltration of cytotoxic immune cells and increased immune checkpoint expression, indicating its potential role in shaping an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Functional enrichment analysis further linked TOPK to key inflammatory signaling pathways, including NOTCH1, TNF-\u03b1, and TGF-\u03b2. In vivo experiments using TOPK-deficient tumor models in immunocompetent mice supported its role in modulating tumor-associated inflammation.While these experiments were based on a non-renal tumor model, the findings nonetheless provide meaningful insights into the immunoregulatory function of TOPK in vivo. Collectively, our results identify TOPK as a promising prognostic biomarker and immunotherapeutic target in KIRC, and offer novel perspectives on its involvement in immune evasion mechanisms.

In a multitude of malignancies, loss of ARID1A protein correlates with poor patient prognosis, increased metastasis, and changes to key cancer pathways such as genomic instability. Despite this, little work has been done to deduce the molecular role of ARID1A in endometrial cancer progression and prognosis, and much of the present work is conflicting data. There is a growing body of work that shows a discordance between ARID1A mutation status and expression of ARID1A protein in endometrioid-type endometrial tumors. Several other malignancies have found that alternative mechanisms of ARID1A protein regulation can confer ARID1A protein loss. Therefore, relying solely on ARID1A sequencing may overlook a cohort of endometrial cancer patients with absence of ARID1A protein. With endometrial cancer being one of the sole malignancies increasing in both incidence and patient mortality since the mid-2000s, it is of upmost importance to assess the impacts and potential prognostic use of commonly mutated proteins such as ARID1A. This review will highlight the critical role of ARID1A in endometrial cancer pathogenesis, its potential therapeutic vulnerabilities, and emphasizes the need to move beyond ARID1A mutation as a sole diagnostic marker to elucidate its molecular and clinical implications in endometrial cancer.",

Despite our ability to identify different biological clusters of EC, we have yet to understand the functional impact of key genomic alterations associated with varying prognoses and exploit this knowledge for therapeutic benefits. Our overarching goal is to understand how genomic alterations impact radiotherapy response in EC, and whether manipulation of these signaling pathways could be utilized as a radio-sensitization strategy. Given that TP53-mutated ECs portend the worst prognoses and seem to benefit from escalation of therapy above that of radiotherapy alone, we first focused our attention on understanding the impact of this genomic aberration on radiation response. Using high-throughput in vitro profiling, genomic manipulation, and in vivo studies, we demonstrated that p53 signaling plays a significant role in the radiotherapy response in EC, thus providing a biological rationale for observed clinical trial findings. We also leveraged this same finding to test a therapeutic approach driving p53/p21 signaling using murine double minute-2 (MDM2) inhibitors, subsequently demonstrating synergism with radiation. Thus, MDM2 inhibitors could be considered as a novel radiosensitizing approach for EC.",

Here, we performed unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens using endocrine sensitive ER+\u2009breast cancer cells to identify novel drivers of resistance to combination endocrine therapy (tamoxifen) and CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib) treatment. Our screens identified the inactivation of JNK signalling, including loss of the kinase MAP2K7, as a key driver of drug insensitivity. We developed multiple CRISPR/Cas9 knockout ER+\u2009breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and T-47D) to investigate the effects of MAP2K7 and downstream MAPK8 and MAPK9 loss. MAP2K7 knockout increased metastatic burden in vivo and led to impaired JNK-mediated stress responses, as well as promoting cell survival and reducing senescence entry following endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment. Mechanistically, this occurred via loss of the AP-1 transcription factor c-JUN, leading to an attenuated response to combination endocrine therapy plus CDK4/6 inhibition. Furthermore, analysis of clinical datasets found that inactivation of the JNK pathway was associated with increased metastatic burden, and low pJNK<sup>T183/Y185</sup> activity correlated with a poorer response to systemic endocrine and CDK4/6 inhibitor therapies in both early-stage and metastatic ER+\u2009breast cancer cohorts.

          "abstract": "Colorectal cancer with deficient mismatch repair (dMMR)/microsatellite instability (MSI) constitutes a distinct clinicopathologic and immunologic subtype, characterized by high sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, prognosis and therapeutic response vary considerably among dMMR/MSI colorectal cancers, underscoring the need for molecular markers to refine patient stratification. In this study, we systematically investigated cancer cell-intrinsic expression profiles of 188 glycosyltransferase genes by integrating single-cell, bulk, and cell line RNA sequencing datasets. This approach identified five glycosyltransferases, including GALNT7, expression of which differed consistently according to MSI status. The clinical and prognostic relevance of these glycosyltransferases was further analyzed across large-scale transcriptomic, proteomic, and IHC cohorts, comprising 662 dMMR/MSI and 3,483 proficient mismatch-repair (pMMR)/microsatellite-stable (MSS) colorectal cancers. A five-gene glycosyltransferase signature effectively distinguished MSI from MSS colorectal cancers across 18 datasets. Among the five genes, GALNT7 expression was robustly associated with favorable prognosis in four independent transcriptomic and IHC cohorts of dMMR/MSI colorectal cancers while showing little or no prognostic impact in pMMR/MSS colorectal cancers. Notably, GALNT7 expression was inversely correlated with PD-L1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in multiple datasets exclusively within dMMR/MSI colorectal cancers, but not in pMMR/MSS CRCs. Functional assays and lectin microarray analysis using MSI colorectal cancer cell lines revealed that GALNT7 knockdown enhanced IFN\u03b3-induced PD-L1 expression without altering cell-surface glycosylation. In conclusion, GALNT7 expression stratified dMMR/MSI colorectal cancers into distinct subsets with differential tumor cell PD-L1 expression and diverse survival outcomes, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker to guide treatment strategies. We identified glycosyltransferases with altered expression depending on MMR/MSI status. Our findings indicate the existence of two molecularly defined subtypes within dMMR/MSI colorectal cancers based on GALNT7 expression, characterized by differential tumor cell PD-L1 levels and distinct survival outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Mutations in the histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), particularly the neomorphic Y641F hot spot mutation, are implicated in hematologic malignancies. However, how developmental timing and cellular context influence their oncogenic potential remains poorly understood. Here, we used a conditional <i>Ezh2</i> <sup>Y641F</sup> allele with multiple tissue-specific Cre drivers to investigate the effects of these mutations across hematopoietic development. We found that ubiquitous or early expression of <i>Ezh2</i> <sup>Y641F</sup> led to bone marrow failure and reduced survival with no evidence of transformation. In contrast, expression in committed B cells using CD19-Cre consistently induced B-cell lymphomas, underscoring a context- and stage-specific requirement for transformation. Transcriptomic analysis of B-cell progenitors revealed distinct gene expression changes between Cre models, including interferon signaling and upregulation of guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) in Mx1-Cre <i>Ezh2</i> <sup>Y641F</sup> mutants. We identified a redistribution of histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation at the GBP locus and showed that GBP2 overexpression impairs multilineage hematopoiesis by promoting apoptosis and skewing differentiation. These findings demonstrate that the oncogenic potential of <i>Ezh2</i> <sup>Y641F</sup> is highly dependent on the cellular environment in which it is expressed and that the timing of mutation acquisition critically shapes the impact of EZH2 on hematopoiesis and disease outcome.",

          "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent primary liver cancer, characterized by a poor prognosis. Many HCC patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage due to the lack of reliable prognostic biomarkers. G6PC1 (Glucose-6-Phosphatase Catalytic Subunit 1) is abnormally expressed in various cancers, including HCC. This study aimed to investigate the biomarker potential and biological functions of G6PC1 to elucidate its impact on HCC pathogenesis. G6PC1 expression levels were assessed using TCGA and GEO datasets. Prognostic implications were explored through Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Potential regulatory transcription factors (TFs) were identified using four prediction tools, and functional mechanisms were investigated via GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Associations between G6PC1 and HCC metabolic reprogramming, as well as the tumor microenvironment were analyzed. G6PC1 exhibited low expression levels in HCC, which correlated with poor patient prognosis. HNF4A may act as a regulatory factor for G6PC1 in HCC. Functional analysis identified co-expressed genes associated with metabolism-related pathways. Furthermore, G6PC1 was implicated in metabolic reprogramming, immune infiltration, and immunotherapy response. Low G6PC1 expression, associated with poor HCC prognosis, is a potential prognostic biomarker. Integrated multi-omics analyses underscore its clinical significance, involvement in metabolic reprogramming, and immunomodulatory functions, providing a foundation for further investigation into its prognostic potential and mechanistic contributions in HCC.",

To assess SDHA expression in breast cancer, we utilized multiple publicly available databases. Prognostic significance was also evaluated using relevant databases. Methylation status, and enrichment analysis were performed using the GSCA database. The mutational status of SDHA was examined using cBioPortal, and its relationship with immune infiltration and drug sensitivity was assessed. Functional assays, including cell proliferation, colony formation, wound healing, and SDHA knockdown, were performed using MCF-7 and SKBR3 breast cancer cell lines. Our results showed that SDHA was significantly overexpressed in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. High SDHA expression was correlated with worse survival in breast cancer patients. Pathological stage analysis revealed that SDHA expression increased as the disease progressed, with lower methylation levels in tumor tissues suggesting epigenetic regulation of its expression. Functionally, SDHA knockdown in MCF-7 and SKBR3 cells led to significant reductions in cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration, highlighting its role in supporting breast cancer cell growth and metastasis. SDHA was upregulated in breast cancer and associated with poor prognosis. Our findings also suggest that SDHA plays a crucial role in promoting breast cancer cell growth and migration, indicating its therapeutic potential. Targeting SDHA could provide a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment, particularly in overcoming chemoresistance and inhibiting tumor progression.",

In this paper, we propose an efficient and interactive feature selection approach based on copula entropy (CEFS+). The method combines feature-feature mutual information with feature-label mutual information and uses a maximum correlation minimum redundancy strategy for greedy selection. The approach uses copula entropy as a measure of feature relevance that captures the full-order interaction gain between features. Moreover, we prove the divisibility of multivariate mutual information, and derive a novel feature criterion, and propose a feature selection approach based on copula entropy called CEFS. Meanwhile, to overcome the instability of the CEFS method on some datasets, we propose the improved method CEFS+ which based on the rank technique. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of CEFS and CEFS+ using three classifiers on five datasets. In 10 out of 15 scenarios, our approach obtains the highest classification accuracy, which is much higher than the other six commonly used FS methods. In particular, our approach performs better on high-dimensional genetic datasets.",

In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), a highly aggressive malignancy of the biliary tract with poor prognosis, the latest clinical trials using TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors have failed indicating that the specific actions carried out by TGF-\u03b2 in iCCA are yet not well delineated. Here, we show that TGF-\u03b2 signalling is highly active in iCCA and exerts a prominent suppressor effect on tumour cell lines and organoids established from iCCA metastases biopsies, that relies on a functional canonical SMAD2/3/4 signalling. Thus, TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors promote, instead of inhibiting, tumour cell growth. In this context, a promising strategy is to target intracellular proteins downstream the TGF-\u03b2 receptors accounting only for TGF-\u03b2 pro-tumorigenic actions. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), a downstream mediator of the TGF-\u03b2 signalling pathway, is strictly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) of iCCA and acts in concert with NOX1 to regulate CAF functions. Use of a dual NOX4/NOX1 inhibitor impaired CAF actions and reduced tumour growth in vitro and in two different in vivo iCCA experimental models. Collectively, our findings reveal an actionable way to specifically target TGF-\u03b2 pro-tumorigenic actions in CAF from iCCA without undesirable side effects on tumour cells, suggesting a potentially bright future for dual NOX4/NOX1 inhibitors in the clinics, alone or in combination with other therapies.",

          "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal tumors, and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC development and progression have not been fully elucidated until now. Emerging studies have shown that post-translational modifications of proteins, especially ubiquitination modifications, play an important role in tumorigenesis and progression. Here we identified that the E3 ligase TRIM31, a member of the TRIM (Tripartite Motif) family proteins, is highly expressed during colorectal inflammation-cancer transformation and is associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients. Knockdown of TRIM31 expression led to the suppression of CRC cell proliferation and migration in vitro, tumor formation and metastatic ability in vivo. TRIM31 interacts with YBX1 and catalyses the Lys63 (K63) linkage polyubiquitination of Lys81 on YBX1, which ultimately leads to the stabilization of the YBX1 protein. YBX1 further enhances the stabilization of mRNAs for EREG, GAS6, and MAFG through both m<sup>5</sup>C site-dependent and -independent recognition routes. In addition, activation of NF-\u03baB promotes the binding of P65 to the promoter region of TRIM31 to activate the transcription of the TRIM31 gene. Furthermore, TRIM31 facilitates the entry of P65 into the nucleus, which in turn creates a positive feedback pathway that promotes inflammatory-carcinogenic transformation and tumorigenesis of colorectal. Our findings indicate that TRIM31 may be an important factor driving colorectal carcinogenesis, providing a potential target for intervention in CRC targeted therapy.",

We developed a comprehensive computational pipeline called SCAN-ACT that leverages single-cell RNA sequencing and multi-omics data from tumor and normal tissues to nominate and prioritize putative targets for both chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)- and TCR-T cells. For surface membrane targets, SCAN-ACT proposes monospecific targets and potential target pairs for bispecific Boolean logic-gated CAR T cells. For peptide-MHC targets, SCAN-ACT proposes intracellular peptides bound to a diverse set of human leukocyte antigens. Selected targets were validated experimentally by protein expression and for peptide-MHC binding. We applied the SCAN-ACT pipeline to soft tissue sarcoma (STS), analyzing 986,749 single cells to identify and prioritize 395 monospecific CAR-T targets, 14,192 bispecific CAR-T targets, and 5020 peptide-MHC targets for TCR-T cells. Proposed targets and target pairs reflected the mesenchymal, neuronal, and hematopoietic ontogeny of STS. We further validated SCAN-ACT in glioblastoma revealing its versatility.

The limited treatment options underscore the urgent need to explore novel molecular targets to combat TNBC progression. This study investigates the oncogenic functions of SHCBP1 in TNBC. Bulk RNA-seq and single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) data for TNBC samples were acquired from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and GSE161529, respectively. SHCBP1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels was compared between TNBC and normal breast tissues. The prognostic significance of SHCBP1 in TNBC was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The potential biological functions of SHCBP1 were explored through gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Immunofluorescence was utilized to determine the subcellular localization of SHCBP1 during cell division. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blotting were employed to measure SHCBP1 expression in breast cancer cell lines. Subsequently, the impact of SHCBP1 on TNBC cell proliferation and migration was evaluated <i>in vitro</i>. Finally, scRNA-seq analysis was conducted to characterize SHCBP1 expression patterns at the single-cell resolution. SHCBP1 is markedly upregulated in TNBC tissues, and its overexpression is associated with poorer survival outcomes. Functional enrichment analysis reveals that SHCBP1-related genes are significantly enriched in pathways involved in cell-cycle regulation and DNA damage response. <i>In vitro</i> studies demonstrate that SHCBP1 enhances TNBC cell proliferation and migration. The scRNA-seq analysis displays the cell clusters in which SHCBP1 is primarily expressed. Cancer epithelial cells exhibiting higher SHCBP1 expression display stronger interactions with stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment. This study elucidates the critical role of SHCBP1 in TNBC progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

However, there remains a need for evidence-based selection criteria for the different panel tests available. Among these tests, ACTOnco+\u00ae stands out as a comprehensive cancer genomic profiling tool. In this study, we compared 110 samples from 29 different tumor types using FoundationOne\u00ae CDx (324 genes for DNA analysis) and ACTOnco+\u00ae (440 genes for DNA and 31 genes for RNA analysis). Overall, the mutation profiles between the 2 assays exhibited 82.8% positive agreement in reported sequence alterations in clinically actionable genes, including single nucleotide variants and insertions-deletions. Copy number gains showed concordance of 76.9%, and copy number losses in 66.7%. In the case of KIAA1549-BRAF fusion-positive astrocytoma, the fusion event was not detected by DNA only test, but RNA sequencing identified the rearrangement.

This study sought to identify mechanisms driving increased ErbB2 activity and their role in progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). ErbB2 signaling was interrogated with a combination of immunohistochemistry, reverse-phase protein array, and RNA sequencing in cell lines, xenografts, and clinical tumors at various stages of castration resistance. Sensitivity to ErbB2 inhibitors was tested in vitro and in vivo. ErbB2 activation, identified by IHC with an antibody against phosphorylated ErbB2, was present in \u223c26% of residual tumors in radical prostatectomies after neoadjuvant androgen signaling inhibition (ASI) and in advanced CRPC. The ErbB3/ErbB2-activating ligand NRG1 was found by IHC in \u223c75% of neoadjuvant-treated tumors. NRG1 mRNA was rapidly increased by ASI in prostate cancer cells and xenografts and was increased in post-ASI data sets. Overexpression of an active ERBB2 splice variant (d16ERBB2) was also increased rapidly after ASI in prostate cancer cells and was found in a subset of CRPC. ErbB2 signaling in all models remained sensitive to the covalent ErbB2 inhibitor neratinib, which enhanced responses to castration and suppressed the growth of castration-resistant xenografts with ErbB2 activation. Increased ErbB2 signaling is a rapid adaptation to ASI and contributes to castration resistance. Increases in NRG1 and d16ERBB2 contribute to increased ErbB2 signaling. Potent ErbB2 antagonists may enhance responses to ASI in castration-sensitive prostate cancer, and ErbB2 phosphorylation may be a biomarker for tumors that will respond in CRPC.",

Machine learning (ML) algorithms have increasingly been used to inform healthcare decisions, but these models are vulnerable to biases in data collection and algorithm creation. ML models have previously been shown to exhibit racial bias, but their fairness towards patients from different age and sex groups have yet to be studied. Therefore, we compared the multimetric performances of five ML models (random forests, multinomial logistic regression, linear support vector classifier, linear discriminant analysis, and multilayer perceptron) when classifying colorectal cancer patients (n\u2009=\u2009589) of various age, sex, and racial groups using The Cancer Genome Atlas data. All five models exhibited biases for these sociodemographic groups. We then repeated the same process on lung adenocarcinoma (n\u2009=\u2009515) to validate our findings. Surprisingly, most models tended to perform more poorly overall for the largest sociodemographic groups. Methods to optimize model performance, including testing the model on merged age, sex, or racial groups, and creating a model trained on and used for an individual or merged sociodemographic group, show potential to reduce disparities in model performance for different groups. This is supported by our regression analysis showing associations between model choice and methodology used with reduced performance disparities across demographic subgroups. Notably, these methods may be used to improve ML fairness while avoiding penalizing the model for exhibiting bias and thus sacrificing overall performance.",

          "abstract": "Purine metabolism is a promising therapeutic target in cancer; however, how cancer cells respond to purine shortage, particularly their adaptation and vulnerabilities, remains unclear. Using the recently developed purine shortage-inducing prodrug DRP-104 and genetic approaches, we investigated the responses in prostate, lung, and glioma cancer models. We demonstrate that when de novo purine biosynthesis is compromised, cancer cells employ microtubules to assemble purinosomes, multiprotein complexes of de novo purine biosynthesis enzymes that enhance purine biosynthesis efficiency. Although this process enables tumor cells to adapt to purine shortage stress, it also renders them more susceptible to the microtubule-stabilizing chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel. Furthermore, we show that although cancer cells primarily rely on de novo purine biosynthesis, they also exploit methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-mediated purine salvage as a crucial alternative source of purine supply, especially under purine shortage stress. In support of this finding, combining DRP-104 with an MTAP inhibitor significantly enhances tumor suppression in prostate cancer models in vivo. Finally, despite the resilience of the purine supply machinery, purine shortage-stressed tumor cells exhibit increased DNA damage and activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, which may contribute to impaired immunoevasion and provide a molecular basis of the previously observed DRP-104-induced antitumor immunity. Together, these findings reveal purinosome assembly and purine salvage as key mechanisms of cancer cell adaptation and resilience to purine shortage while identifying microtubules, MTAP, and immunoevasion deficits as therapeutic vulnerabilities.",

          "abstract": "Tobacco smoke is a known mutagen. However, its physiological effects on the lung may also influence the somatic selective pressures acting on mutations, further shaping cancer evolution. The relative contributions of these mutagenic and physiological effects to oncogenesis have not been quantified, despite their importance in predicting the differential therapeutic effect of targeting variants in lung cancers of smokers and nonsmokers. We classified 1,722 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) sample genomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas and other projects as ever-smoker (ES) or never-smoker (NS) LUAD based on smoking-associated mutational signature attribution or clinical annotation. We then independently calculated background oncogenic mutation rates in the ES- and NS-LUAD groups. Comparing these background rates to observed variant prevalences enabled us to estimate and compare the selective advantages conferred by each mutation in ES- and NS-LUAD. Finally, we quantified pairwise and higher-order epistatic effects by estimating selection for each mutation in specific somatic genotypes. As expected, background oncogenic mutation rates were gene-specifically elevated in ES-LUAD. However, differences in oncogenic mutation rates between ES- and NS- LUAD were insufficient to explain differences in the prevalence of some mutated genes, implying that such mutations must have further experienced differential somatic selection. In particular, <i>KRAS</i>, <i>KEAP1</i>, and <i>STK11</i> mutations experienced substantially stronger selection in ES-LUAD, whereas mutations of <i>EGFR</i>, <i>PIK3CA</i>, <i>SMAD4</i>, and other genes were more strongly selected in NS-LUAD. Mechanistically, <i>EGFR</i> mutations were associated with upregulation of genes involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in NS-LUAD, but not in ES-LUAD. Epistasis was pervasive and distinct between the subtypes: ES-LUAD featured more frequent synergy and substantially less antagonism. These patterns entail divergent evolutionary trajectories, with NS-LUAD constrained to fewer, narrower paths and ES-LUAD exploring a broader, more permissive adaptive landscape. Furthermore, we identified higher-order epistasis-systematically examined here for the first time in cancer-manifesting as sub-additive and emergent synergistic interactions that selectively promote trajectories of oncogenesis. This disambiguation of the mutagenic and selective effects of tobacco smoke reveals how environmental insult can reshape the evolutionary trajectories of LUAD and enables quantitative prediction of treatment vulnerabilities based on smoking status and tumor somatic genotype.",

This research identified coagulation-related subtypes (CRSs) and evaluated a coagulation-related risk score for its prognostic value in CRC. CRC dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas was analyzed to identify CRSs using nonnegative matrix factorization, which was validated across GSE39582 and pan-cancer datasets. A list of 285 coagulation-related genes was used to develop a risk signature via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and multivariate Cox regression. We also assessed immune characteristics and treatment responses using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis, Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion, and immunophenoscore, and constructed an overall survival-related nomogram. CRS analysis categorized pan-cancers, including CRC, into three clusters: C1 with poor immune infiltration but better prognosis, C2 with high immune activity and prolonged survival, and C3 marked by dense immunosuppressive cells correlating with poor outcomes. Drug sensitivity analysis showed distinct responses across CRSs, influencing treatment choices. We developed a coagulation-related risk score based on F2RL2, GP1BA, MMP10, and TIMP1, which stratified CRC patients by outcome and correlated with distinct patterns of immune infiltration and therapeutic response. A validated nomogram incorporating age, TNM stage, and risk score accurately predicted overall survival, while experimental validations confirmed the bioinformatics predictions regarding TIMP1's role in CRC progression. A coagulation-based classifier effectively categorizes CRC and potentially other cancers, interacting significantly with the immune microenvironment to influence disease progression and treatment responsiveness.

Here we characterize a series of clinical-grade small-molecule catalytic NSD2 inhibitors (NSD2i)\u00a0and show that the pharmacological targeting of NSD2 constitutes an epigenetic dependency with broad therapeutic efficacy in KRAS-driven preclinical cancer models. NSD2i inhibits\u00a0NSD2\u00a0with single-digit nanomolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration potency and high selectivity over related methyltransferases. Structural analyses reveal that the specificity of NSD2i for NSD2 is due to competitive binding with S-adenosylmethionine and catalytic disruption through a binary-channel obstruction mechanism. Proteo-epigenomic and single-cell strategies in pancreatic and lung cancer models support a mechanism in which sustained NSD2i exposure reverses pathological H3K36me2-driven chromatin plasticity, re-establishing silencing at H3K27me3-legacy loci to curtail oncogenic gene expression programs. Accordingly, NSD2i impairs the viability of pancreatic and lung cancer cells and the growth of patient-derived xenograft tumours.

Although PARP inhibitors like Olaparib have shown efficacy in BRCA-mutated cancers, their benefit is limited in broader patient populations. TP53 mutations, highly prevalent in ovarian cancer, promote tumor progression and resistance, making p53 a key therapeutic target. This study evaluated the anticancer potential of HO-3867, a curcumin analog known to restore mutant p53 function, alone and in combination with Olaparib. We used fallopian tube-derived ovarian cancer models harboring mutant or null TP53 and analyzed TP53 expression and mutation profiles using TCGA datasets. Molecular docking simulations and cellular thermal shift assays (CETSA) confirmed HO-3867 binding to the p53<sup>Y220C</sup> mutant core domain. Cytotoxicity was assessed via SRB assays; flow cytometry and Western blotting were used to examine cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and DNA damage. HO-3867 treatment increased phospho-p53 (Ser15) and p21 expression, induced G1 phase arrest, and suppressed cell viability. Notably, co-treatment with Olaparib synergistically enhanced apoptosis, as indicated by increased caspase-3 and PARP1 cleavage and elevated \u03b3H2AX levels. These findings suggest that HO-3867 reactivates mutant p53 and potentiates Olaparib efficacy by promoting apoptosis and amplifying DNA damage, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for TP53-mutant ovarian cancer.",

          "abstract": "Sodium iodide symporter (NIS) expression in breast cancer renders radioiodide (RAI) a promising treatment modality. However, insufficient functional NIS within the plasma membrane limits RAI uptake (RAIU). We aimed to elucidate NIS regulatory mechanisms that impede RAIU in breast cancer and identify molecular targets for stimulating RAI-avidity in breast tumours. Mechanistic interaction between pituitary tumor-transforming gene-binding factor (PBF/PTTG1IP) and NIS was investigated through NanoBiT, co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescent microscopy, subcellular localisation and RAIU assays utilising wild-type and CRISPR-Cas9 PBF knockout breast cancer cells. In breast cancer cells, NIS:PBF interaction resulted in diminished RAIU, reversible through reduced PBF phosphorylation by the Src inhibitor dasatinib. Src overexpression diminished RAIU in a PBF-dependent manner that was mediated by Src myristoylation by N-myristoyltransferase 1 (NMT1). NMT1 inhibition significantly enhanced RAIU via Src and PBF in breast and thyroid cancer cells. Bioinformatic analyses revealed clinical associations between high Src and NMT1 expression and increased tumour recurrence in RAI-treated thyroid cancers indicating RAI-resistance. In breast cancer, high PBF and Src expression was associated with the more aggressive tumours that are most likely to benefit from targeted RAI therapy. We describe a new NIS regulatory pathway in breast cancer cells via Src myristoylation and PBF phosphorylation and show that the same pathway exists in thyroid cells, the canonical setting for the exploitation of NIS function. These findings reveal that PBF interaction with NIS may be modulated by Src, which in turn is susceptible to NMT inhibition, and suggest that targeting NMT1 may represent an innovative approach for augmenting RAI-avidity in breast cancer.",

          "abstract": "Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several types of cancer. Nevertheless, the exact correlation between ferroptosis-related gene mutations and their influence on ovarian cancer (OV) diagnosis and treatment strategies remains to be fully elucidated. It is crucial to identify the ferroptosis-related gene signature in OV and elucidate the impact of these mutations and their expression on the diagnosis and treatment of OV. In this study, we collected data from the TCGA and GEO databases. We utilized various tools and packages for data analysis, including the cBio Cancer Genomics Portal, Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), GSVA package, and WGCNA R packages. Our results showed that ferroptosis subtypes 1 (FS1) and 2 (FS2) exhibited different levels of expression and tumor mutation burden (TMB). FS2 had a higher TMB level and survival rate compared to FS1. Furthermore, our analysis identified three ferroptosis-related genes, including IFNG, KEAP1, and PHKG2, as key biomarkers in prognosis prediction and potential targets for OV cancer therapy. The elevated expression levels of IFNG, KEAP1, and PHKG2 were found to be correlated with a good prognosis. These three genes showed a positive correlation with TMB in OV. We also observed that high TMB was more robustly associated with immune response-related gene expression, including CD28, CD40L, and type I IFN family members. Moreover, high TMB was associated with increased T cell infiltration and exhibited a distinct gene signature, which highlights the potential of IFNG, KEAP1, and PHKG2 as predictive markers for T cell infiltration and the tumor microenvironment status in OV. A significant correlation exists between the expression levels of KEAP1 and PHKG2 and TMB in OV cell lines. In conclusion, our study identified KEAP1, IFNG, and PHKG2 as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in OV. Their expression and mutation burden were correlated with a good prognosis. The association between ferroptosis subtypes, TMB, and survival rates further supports the relevance of these biomarkers. Additionally, the positive correlation between KEAP1, IFNG, and PHKG2 with TMB and immune response-related gene expression highlights their potential as predictive markers for immunotherapy efficacy in OV. The observed association of high TMB with increased T cell infiltration and distinct gene signature further emphasizes its role as a potential biomarker for immune response. Further research is warranted to validate these findings and explore their clinical implications in OV treatment.",

However, no structural information on the architecture of this tumor suppressor complex is available hampering a mechanistic understanding of its functionality. Here, we present a cryo-EM structure of RalGAP that reveals an extended 58\u2009nm tetrameric architecture comprising two heterodimers of the RalGAP\u03b1 and RalGAP\u03b2 subunits. We show that the catalytic domain of RalGAP\u03b1 requires stabilization by a unique domain of RalGAP\u03b2, providing the molecular basis for why RalGAP complexes are obligatory heterodimers. Formation of RalGAP tetramers is not required for activity in vitro, but essential for function of the complex in vivo. Structural analysis of RalGAP subunit variants reported in cancer patients suggests effects on complex formation and thus functional relevance, emphasizing the significance of the obtained structural information for medical research.",

Moreover, the expression of MICA in tumor cells is closely associated with immune cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it remains unclear whether MICA expression correlates with TAMs and influences the switch in macrophage phenotype by mediating metabolic alterations. <b>Methods:</b> Various biostatistical tools, qPCR, and IHC staining experiments were utilized to analyze data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and collected HCC tumor tissues. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses and a co-culture model of HCC cells with macrophages were performed to validate the findings from the biostatistical analyses. <b>Results:</b> Through the intersection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), metabolism-related genes (MRGs), and co-expression genes (CEGs) with MICA in HCC, the EHHADH gene was identified. Gene set enrichment analyses were conducted to further confirm the role of EHHADH. EHHADH expression is decreased in HCC tumors and can serve as a prognostic biomarker for HCC. Expressions of MICA and EHHADH exhibited significant correlations with various phenotypic macrophages and exerted opposing effects on M1-like and M2-like macrophages infiltrating HCC. The underlying metabolic and molecular mechanisms revealed that MICA in tumor cells induced M2-like polarization through the PPAR/EHHADH pathway, which regulates the fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in macrophages. <b>Conclusions:</b> The metabolic gene EHHADH, which is associated with MICA, led to alterations in M2-like macrophages by promoting heightened fatty acid uptake and augmenting levels of FAO within macrophages.",

This study analyzed the role of the phosphoprotein Stathmin 1 (STMN1) in regulating cancer cell growth and metastatic potential. <b>Methods</b>: Public datasets with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and breast cancer (BC) were analyzed to determine the interrelationship between STMN1, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and MET proto-oncogene (MET) expression, overall survival, and response to chemotherapy. Site-directed mutagenesis, cell cycle analysis, proliferation, and migration and invasion assays determined the impact of STMN1 phosphorylation on proliferation and metastatic potential. <b>Results</b>: Increased STMN1 associates with HGF and MET gene expression in mCRPC, and taxane chemotherapy further increases HGF expression. STMN1 and HGF are highest, and overall survival is poorest in mCRPC in the liver compared to other sites, implying the metastatic site influences their expression levels and potentially the pattern of metastatic spread. Increased STMN1 and MET also predict taxane responsiveness in BC patients. Analysis of STMN1 serine (S)16, 25, 38, and 63 determined that total (t) STMN1 and STMN1 S16 phosphorylation (pSTMN1<sup>S16</sup>) are co-regulated by HGF/MET during cell cycle progression, pSTMN1<sup>S16</sup> alone can promote cell proliferation, and pSTMN1<sup>S16</sup> shortens the cell cycle similar to HGF treatment, while STMN1<sup>S16</sup> dephosphorylation lengthens the cell cycle to arrest cell growth in G2/M, similar to HGF plus the MET inhibitor AMG337.

We further examine the integration of advanced tools-such as genomic heatmaps and temporal timelines-into multidisciplinary workflows to support personalised care.

          "abstract": "Brain cancer represents a complex disease influenced by a multitude of genetic and epigenetic factors. This study aims to elucidate the role of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the pathogenesis of brain cancer, employing a multi-omics approach. We conducted extensive eQTL, mQTL, haQTL, sQTL, and caQTL analyses to identify genetic variants and lncRNAs associated with brain cancer. Integration with GWAS-GWAS colocalization analysis provided insights into shared genetic mechanisms with other diseases. We further investigated copy number variation (CNV) and methylation status in relation to gene expression, and their prognostic implications in different brain cancer subtypes. SNP rs615552_AL359922.1 exhibited significant colocalization with key genes CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and CDKN2B-AS1, implicating its role in the regulation of gene expression. The long non-coding RNA CDKN2B-AS1 demonstrated both co-occurrence and co-expression with CDKN2A and CDKN2B, suggesting a coordinated regulatory mechanism among these genes. TERT emerged as a gene with shared susceptibility across brain cancer and other diseases, indicating a common genetic pathway. Methylation sites associated with mQTL, such as cg03935379 (TERT) and cg14069088 (CDKN2A), were identified as independent prognostic factors for lower-grade glioma (LGG), but not for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Bulk RNA-seq, spatial, and single-cell transcriptomic analyses revealed that CDKN2B-AS1 is predominantly expressed in malignant and dendritic cells (DCs), and is associated with DNA repair pathways in malignant cells and antigen presentation genes in DCs. This study offers a comprehensive perspective on the genetic and molecular factors influencing brain cancer. The results highlight the intricate nature of gene regulation in cancer and suggest the potential of CDKN2B-AS1 as a key regulator of immune responses and tumor suppressor genes. The SNP rs615552_AL359922.1 represents a significant pathogenic SNP for brain cancer. The identification of shared genetic mechanisms, particularly involving TERT, with other diseases points to new opportunities for developing therapeutic targets and diagnostic tools. Future research should focus on functional validation and the investigation of environmental interactions to fully leverage these findings for advancing brain cancer management.",

To analyse and characterize the genetic variations in the\u00a0CTNNB1 across three geographically diverse cohorts of hepatoblastoma patients and understand their potential pathogenic mechanisms. The exome data for 54 hepatoblastoma tissue samples was subjected to quality control and alignment to GRCh38. SNVs were identified using GATK/Mutect2 and annotated using multiple databases. CTNNB1 gene variants were filtered and analyzed using cBioPortal, CONSURF 3.0, STRING database, and VarElect for comprehensive molecular and phenotypic analysis. CTNNB1 mutations were identified in 88.9% of patients, with 21 unique variants found in 24 patients post-filtering. Exon 3 was most frequently affected, with 17 unique mutations present in 91.66% of mutation-positive patients. The most common variants were c.101G\u2009>\u2009T (p.Gly34Val), c.98C\u2009>\u2009T (p.Ser33Phe), and c.98C\u2009>\u2009A (p.Ser33Tyr). Novel mutations were identified at positions S29 and I35, while additional variations were found in exons 4, 7, 10, and 13. This study identified significant CTNNB1 genetic variations in hepatoblastoma, confirming exon 3 as a critical mutational hotspot. The findings enhance our understanding of HB pathogenesis and suggest potential therapeutic targets, particularly in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.

Thus, there is an urgent need to discover novel therapeutic targets and strategies to overcome metastasis. A series of in vitro and in vivo phenotype experiments were performed to investigate the role of phosphodiesterase 1A (PDE1A) in NSCLC. The RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, messenger RNA (mRNA) stability assay, and LC-MS/MS were performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of PDE1A in NSCLC progression. PDE1A has been shown to promote metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression of NSCLC. In addition, NSCLC cells overexpressing PDE1A promoted angiogenesis by regulating exosome release. IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway was highly enriched in PDE1A-coexpressed genes, and PDE1A promoted NSCLC metastasis by activating the STAT3 pathway. GO enrichment analysis of PDE1A-interacting genes showed that PDE1A might interact with YTHDF2 and participate in m6A-containing RNA binding. The binding between PDE1A and YTHDF2 was verified, and PDE1A regulated the STAT3 pathway by interacting with YTHDF2. The mechanism of the YTHDF2/PDE1A complex in regulating the STAT3 pathway was predicted by overlapping YTHDF2-interacting RNAs and genes coexpressed with YTHDF2 and STAT3. The interactions between YTHDF2 and target mRNAs were predicted, and there were three predicted targets of YTHDF2 with high scores: NRF2, SOCS2, and MET. Indeed, PDE1A interacted with YTHDF2, destabilized SOCS2, and activated the STAT3 pathway. Mechanistic data uncover a novel PDE1A/YTHDF2/STAT3 axis driving NSCLC metastasis and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for metastatic disease.",

Cell cycle analysis indicated that PDL1 silencing increased S-phase entry in lung ADC cells. Furthermore, PDL1 expression reduced FAK, ERK, and AKT phosphorylation, increasing cell detachment from the substrate. Gene expression profiling identified TGFBI as a downstream molecule of PDL1. TGF-\u03b2 induced TGFBI expression, and knockdown of TGFBI increased the growth of lung ADC cells. Given that TGF-\u03b2 regulates CITED2 and p21<sup>CIP1</sup> to initiate cell growth arrest, we examined the PDL1-TGFBI axis's impact on these molecules. Knockdown of PDL1 or TGFBI induced CITED2 expression but decreased p21<sup>CIP1</sup> expression in lung ADC cells. Moreover, inhibiting FAK via pharmacologic or genetic approaches decreased CITED2 but increased p21<sup>CIP1</sup> expression in PDL1-silenced lung ADC cells. These findings suggest that intrinsic PDL1-TGFBI signaling inhibits FAK activation, affecting the CITED2 molecular switch, which induces p21<sup>CIP1</sup>, ultimately leading to cell growth arrest. Our study provides insights into intrinsic PDL1 signaling in lung ADC oncogenesis and indicates that PDL1 expression could be a biomarker for lung ADC progression.",

          "abstract": "Stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1\u03b1), which plays a pivotal role in regulating cellular responses to insufficient oxygen, is implicated in cancer progression, particularly epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastatic dissemination. Despite its crucial role in tumorigenesis, the precise mechanisms governing HIF1\u03b1 stabilization under varying tumor microenvironmental conditions are not fully understood. In this study, we show that stabilization of HIF1\u03b1 in metastasizing melanoma under mild hypoxia is regulated primarily by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) rather than by reduced oxygen levels. Activated HIF1\u03b1 suppresses the expression of cyclophilin D (CypD), a regulator of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), as a reciprocal regulatory mechanism to sustain HIF1 signaling via upregulation of microRNAs miR-23a and miR-27a. Reduced expression of CypD leads to mPTP closure, resulting in elevated mitochondrial calcium accumulation and enhanced oxidative phosphorylation, which in turn increases mitochondrial ROS levels. The ROS then inhibits a prolyl hydroxylase, establishing a pseudohypoxic state that stabilizes HIF1\u03b1 even in the presence of oxygen. This HIF1-reinforced and mitochondria-driven pseudohypoxic induction is essential for maintaining HIF1 signaling under conditions of mild hypoxia or transient increases in oxygen levels during melanoma metastasis. Overexpression of CypD reversed the pseudohypoxic state and potently inhibited melanoma metastasis. Thus, mitochondria-driven pseudohypoxic induction is critical for sustaining HIF1 signaling in metastasizing cancer cells and can be exploited to develop anti-metastatic therapies.",

Transcriptomic data from public databases (TIMER, UALCAN, GEO) revealed significant FBXO10 upregulation in HCC tissues, with elevated expression predicting advanced tumor stage, metastasis, and reduced survival. Functionally, FBXO10 silencing suppressed HCC cell proliferation while its overexpression promoted tumor growth. Mechanistic studies revealed that FBXO10 directly interacts with FRMPD1 to mediate its K63-linked polyubiquitination and stabilization, independent of transcriptional regulation. FRMPD1 restoration rescued FBXO10-mediated proliferation, confirming its role as the key downstream effector. Clinically, FBXO10 expression correlated with TP53 mutations and adverse clinicopathological features.

However, how the order of mutations impacts cancer phenotypes of solid tumors remains poorly understood. To address this, we developed a novel computational framework, IMOP-Cancer (Identifying Mutation Order Pairs in Cancer), to identify mutation gene pairs whose order influences cancer phenotypes. We applied IMOP-Cancer to The Cancer Genome Atlas-Lung Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-LUAD) cohort and identified 446 key mutation order pairs, with 34 pairs significantly associated with prognosis. Mutation order impacts cancer phenotypes, as demonstrated by CSMD3 and PTPRD (tumor proliferation) and TP53 and NAV3 (immune modulation), with effects validated in four independent datasets. We further presented the impact of mutation pairs on cancer phenotypes through case studies in the TCGA cohorts of bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), and colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). We extended this analysis to 33 cancer cohorts from TCGA portal, identifying 106\u00a0034 critical mutation pairs across 17 cancers, with 3036 pairs co-occurring in multiple cancers. Shared mutation pairs across cancers also showed distinct effects on cancer phenotype. Our study highlights the importance of mutation order in cancer progression and diversity, offering new insights into the temporal dynamics of co-occurring mutations and paving the way for personalized treatment strategies and improved diagnosis.",

Understanding TNBC's unique cell signaling and gene expression profiles will reveal novel therapeutic strategies.\u00a0Non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), have emerged as key regulators of gene expression and potential therapeutic targets. This study focuses on a TNBC-enriched lncRNA, non-coding RNA in the aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A pathway (NRAD1, previously LINC00284), which promotes progression in multiple cancers. Our analysis reveals that NRAD1 is central to miRNA-mRNA networks in TNBC cells, mediating cancer-promoting gene expression changes. Fractionation studies showed that NRAD1 is primarily located in the nucleus and mitochondria, with some cytoplasmic presence allowing for transcript-specific competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) interactions with miRNAs. However, NRAD1 primarily effects miRNAs independently of ceRNA activity, instead upregulating DICER (a miRNA biogenesis protein), altering sub-cellular distribution, and reducing biogenesis of mitochondria-localized miRNA (i.e., miR-4485-3p). These findings demonstrate novel regulatory interactions between the cancer-promoting lncRNA NRAD1 and miRNAs that alter gene expression in TNBC, expanding our understanding of regulatory lncRNA-miRNA effects, TNBC biology, and highlighting future therapeutic strategies for targeting non-coding RNAs.",

DNAJB4 expression was significantly lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues in pan-cancer analysis. Reduced expression of DNAJB4 correlated with clinical outcomes, tumor purity, genomic alterations, immune microenvironment features, and drug sensitivity. In kidney neoplasm patients, DNAJB4 expression was significantly lower in tumor tissues (P value\u2009<\u20090.001) and was associated with poor prognosis, including progression-free survival (P value\u2009<\u20090.01) and overall survival (P value\u2009<\u20090.05).

Resistance can arise from activating mutations in the gene encoding ER (<i>ESR1</i>) or from reactivation of downstream targets. Newer ER antagonists occasionally show efficacy but are largely ineffective as single agents in the long term. Here, we show that ER translation is eIF4E/cap-independent yet sensitive to inhibitors of the translation initiation factor eIF4A. EIF4A inhibition reduces the expression of ER and cell cycle regulators such as cyclin D1. This leads to growth suppression in ligand-independent breast cancer models, including those driven by ER mutants and fusion proteins. Efficacy is enhanced by adding the ER degrader, fulvestrant. The combination further lowers ER expression and blocks tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. In an early clinical trial (NCT04092673), the eIF4A inhibitor zotatifin was combined with either fulvestrant or fulvestrant plus CDK4 inhibitor, abemaciclib, in patients with acquired resistance to these agents. Multiple clinical responses including a handful of durable regressions were observed, with little toxicity. Thus, eIF4A inhibition could be useful for treating ER+ breast cancer resistant to other modalities.",

To examine and interpret data on major genes involved in EMT and associate their changes with low-grade (LGG) and/or high-grade (HGG) gliomas, data from the cBioPortal-a publicly available database for tumor genomics and transcriptomics, were collected for 13 genes: CDH1, CDH2, CTNNB1, LEF1, NOTCH1, SNAI1, SNAI2, SOX2, TJP1/ZO1, TWIST1, VIM, ZEB1, and ZEB2. The dataset included mutations, copy number alterations (CNA), and changes in transcript levels reported for each gene. The genes were additionally validated by gene expression on the GlioVis portal, STRING protein network analysis, survival analysis, and experimentally with qRT-PCR. Glioblastoma and diffuse glioma harbored changes in all 13 analyzed genes, while anaplastic oligodendroglioma and anaplastic astrocytoma in 46.15%, oligodendroglioma in 23.08%, and oligoastrocytoma in 15.38%. NOTCH1 and SOX2 were most affected by changes. The NOTCH1 gene was statistically more frequently changed compared to CDH1, CTNNB1, and ZEB1 (p < 0.05). The virtual study showed that alterations in NOTCH1 and LEF1 were associated with LGG, while alterations in CDH1, CTNNB1, TJP1, TWIST1, SOX2, VIM, ZEB1, and ZEB2 were associated with HGG. Differential expression analysis stratified for IDH1 mutations showed that IDH1-mutant glioblastoma had significantly lower CDH2, LEF1 and SNAI1 expression, and higher ZEB1. Gene expression in different glioblastoma subtypes showed that the TJP1/ZO1 gene was associated with the classical subtype, while ZEB2 was associated with the proneural subtype. qRT-PCR confirmed GlioVis mRNA expression data for NOTCH1, SOX2, CDH1, CTNNB1, TJP1/ZO-1, VIM, TWIST1, and partially for SNAI1 (SNAIL), SNAI2, and CDH2.

          "abstract": "Uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS) is a rare but aggressive tumor with high rates of recurrence and poor prognosis, and novel therapies are urgently needed. P53 mutations are identified in over 90% of cases, and other cell cycle alterations are commonly found indicating potential vulnerability to Wee1 kinase inhibition. The purpose of this study was to determine the activity and safety of adavosertib, a Wee1 inhibitor, in recurrent or persistent UCS. This was a phase II single-institution study of patients with persistent or recurrent UCS. Eligible patients had a confirmed <i>TP53</i> alteration, RECIST measurable disease, and prior treatment with platinum based systemic therapy. Patients were treated with adavosertib at a starting dose of 300\u00a0mg orally once daily days 1-5 and 8-12 of a 21\u00a0day cycle until progression. The co-primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and rate of progression-free survival (PFS) at 6\u00a0months. Molecular alterations were identified by targeted next generation sequencing where available. 9 patients enrolled prior to drug discontinuation by the sponsor. ORR was 22.2\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 2.8-60\u00a0%) with 2 partial responses. 3 patients (33.3\u00a0%) had stable disease. Median PFS was 2.7\u00a0months (95\u00a0% CI 0.9 - not reached). Treatment-related adverse events (all grades) occurred in 8 patients (88.9\u00a0%), most commonly diarrhea (77.8\u00a0%) and fatigue (66.7\u00a0%). In this phase II trial of 9 patients with <i>TP53</i>-mutated UCS, adavosertib demonstrated limited activity. However, future studies of molecular alterations and combinatorial strategies continue to be of interest in UCS with limited treatment options.",

This study investigates the prognostic significance and dual biological functions of lncRNA OTUD6B-AS1 in breast cancer (BC), focusing on its roles in immune evasion and ferroptosis resistance. Multi-omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and lncRNA databases (AnnoLnc2, LncACTdb 3.0) were integrated to analyze OTUD6B-AS1 expression, clinical relevance, and molecular networks. Experimental validations included co-culture assays with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, drug sensitivity tests, and ferroptosis marker analysis. OTUD6B-AS1 exhibited significant overexpression across multiple cancers, particularly in breast cancer (BC), where elevated levels strongly correlated with poor prognosis. Its expression was closely associated with key clinical indicators (T/N/M stage, ER/PR/HER2 status), prompting the development of a nomogram prognostic model with high clinical applicability. Genomic analysis revealed frequent amplification of OTUD6B-AS1 and co-occurrence of PIK3CA mutations. Co-expression and ceRNA networks highlighted its interaction with RNA degradation pathways. Notably, OTUD6B-AS1 was associated with immune evasion by regulating PD-L1 and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activity. Concurrently, high OTUD6B-AS1 expression conferred ferroptosis resistance via GPX4/SLC7A11 modulation. In conclusion, OTUD6B-AS1 serves as a biomarker in BC, driving immune evasion and ferroptosis resistance. Targeting OTUD6B-AS1 may enhance immunotherapy efficacy and overcome chemoresistance, offering novel therapeutic avenues.",

The epidermal growth factor receptor (<i>EGFR</i>) plays an important role in tumor progression and treatment resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). <i>EGFR</i>-targeted therapies in combination with radiotherapy (RT) have not been successful at enhancing RT's response or improving tumor control. The response of NSCLCs carrying <i>EGFR</i> mutations to SABR has not been well investigated, although worse overall survival is seen among patients with L858R-<i>EGFR</i> mutations. We aim to evaluate the effect of different <i>EGFR</i>-mutant lung cancers to SABR <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of response and resistance to SABR. A549 cells were stably transfected with either wild-type-<i>EGFR</i> (WT), deleted-<i>EGFR</i> (DEL), or L858R-<i>EGFR</i> (L858R) constructs to generate isogenic cell lines. <i>In vitro</i> assessment included colony formation, cell viability, and proliferation assays. Tumor formation was assessed by subcutaneous injection of pre-irradiated cells in yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)/severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. All mice were sourced from the Animal Resource Division at the McGill University Healthcare Centre. Response to SABR was evaluated in mice injected subcutaneously with isogenic cells and followed with sham or 34 Gy treatment. Tumors collected from both groups were evaluated for SABR effect histologically. <i>EGFR</i>-mutant cell lines displayed a similar <i>in vitro</i> response to SABR: reduced colony formation, cell viability, and cell cycle arrest in G2. Pre-irradiated WT-<i>EGFR</i> and L858R-<i>EGFR</i> NSCLC cell lines maintained their ability to initiate tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>, whilst pre-irradiated DEL-<i>EGFR</i> cells were unable to form tumors upon injection. Subcutaneous DEL-<i>EGFR</i> xenograft tumors had a significant decrease in tumor volume post-SABR treatment compared to WT and L858R-<i>EGFR</i> xenografts. Histological assessment demonstrated less necrosis and a decrease (P=0.049) of apoptotic cells in DEL-<i>EGFR</i>-treated tumors compared to L858R-<i>EGFR</i>. Novel demonstration of DEL-<i>EGFR</i> mutation imparting better response to SABR compared to WT-<i>EGFR</i> or L858R-<i>EGFR</i> mutations, consistent with findings from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), suggesting L858R-<i>EGFR</i> mutations are associated with worse overall survival. Radiation dose fractionation should be investigated further to establish an optimal SABR regimen in the context of LCs and possible overall survival with <i>EGFR</i> mutations.",

          "abstract": "There is intense interest in the advancement of RNAs as rationally designed therapeutic agents, especially in oncology, where a major focus is to use RNAs to stimulate pattern recognition receptors to leverage innate immune responses. However, the inability to selectively deliver therapeutic RNAs within target cells after intravenous administration now hinders the development of this type of treatment for cancer and other disorders. Here, we found that a tumor-targeting, cell-penetrating, and RNA binding monoclonal antibody, TMAB3, can form stable, noncovalent antibody/RNA complexes of a discrete size that mediate highly specific and functional delivery of RNAs into tumors. Using 3p-hpRNA, an agonist of the pattern recognition receptor retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), we observed robust antitumor efficacy of systemically administered TMAB3/3p-hpRNA complexes in mouse models of pancreatic cancer, medulloblastoma, and melanoma. In the KPC syngeneic, orthotopic pancreatic cancer model in immunocompetent mice, treatment with TMAB3/3p-hpRNA tripled animal survival, decreased tumor growth, and specifically targeted malignant cells, with a 1500-fold difference in RNA delivery into tumor cells versus nonmalignant cells within the tumor mass. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry demonstrated that TMAB3/3p-hpRNA treatment elicited a potent antitumoral immune response characterized by RIG-I activation and increased infiltration and activity of cytotoxic T cells. These studies established that TMAB3/RNA complexes can deliver RNA payloads specifically to hard-to-treat tumor cells to achieve antitumor efficacy, providing an antibody-based platform to advance the study of RNA therapies for the treatment of patients with cancer.",

Survival analysis demonstrated that SREBF1 overexpression serves as an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Focusing on CRC, functional studies revealed that SREBF1 drives tumor progression by enhancing cancer cell proliferation and migration, while its knockdown induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HCT116 cells. Mechanistically, SREBF1 is implicated in lipid metabolic reprogramming and interacts with the tumor immune microenvironment, also with genetic alterations. This study highlights the regulatory role of SREBF1 in pan-cancer contexts and provides novel insights into its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target, particularly in colorectal cancer.",

          "abstract": "Bladder cancer (BLCA) is a prevalent urological malignancy that exhibits a high degree of tumor heterogeneity and morbidity. Tumor angiogenesis, a vital hallmark of cancer, greatly influences the tumor microenvironment (TME). The emergence of anti-angiogenic drugs has provided a new turning point in cancer treatment. An integrated machine learning system was constructed to build the angiogenesis-related gene signatures (ARGS). ARGS was used to assess TME status in BLCA. Pharmacophore construction was employed to construct pharmacophore features of highly cytotoxic drug payload combinations for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). In addition,\u00a0we developed a natural compound using artificial intelligence-driven drug design technology.\u00a0This compound exhibits anti-angiogenic effects in BLCA and serves as a highly cytotoxic drug payload for ADCs. Multi-dimensional machine learning was used to screen biomarkers for evaluating the post-treatment effects of drug therapy in BLCA. The ARGS consists of 12 angiogenesis-related genes associated with prognostic risk in BLCA. The ARGS divides BLCA patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. Significant TME remodeling was identified in the high-risk BLCA cohort and demonstrated a strong association with tumor angiogenesis. Expression levels of key immune checkpoint markers significantly differed between BLCA risk groups. Saikosaponin D (SSD) shows promising potential as a novel ADC drug for anti-angiogenic treatment in BLCA. Multi-dimensional machine learning results indicate that MYH11 is the most likely biomarker for evaluating the post-treatment effects of SSD therapy. SSD may potentially treat tumors by regulating angiogenesis in BLCA. The detection of MYH11 can be used to assess the therapeutic effectiveness of SSD in BLCA.",

          "abstract": "Copy number gene amplification and associated overexpression of driver oncogenes are genetic events that contribute to cancer progression and drug resistance. MDS1 and EVI1 Complex locus (MECOM) gene is copy number amplified and overexpressed in aggressive epithelial ovarian cancers. The biological function and precise molecular mechanism of MECOM in the progression and drug resistance of ovarian cancer remain unclear. Here, we unravel MECOM as a regulator of KRAS and its downstream MAP Kinase signalling pathway, and also identify epigenetic inhibitor JIB-04 as a pharmacological agent targeting MECOM/KRAS axis. RNAi-mediated attenuation of MECOM in ovarian cancer cells harboring MECOM amplification reduced their proliferation, impaired colony formation, and impeded cellular migration. ChIP-qPCR analysis confirmed binding of MECOM to the KRAS promoter, suggesting direct regulation of the KRAS gene at the transcriptional level. Further, MECOM promoted cellular proliferation by regulating KRAS-mediated ERK/ZEB1 signalling cascade. The anti-tumorigenic effects due to MECOM loss were phenocopied by the treatment of ovarian cancer cells harboring MECOM amplification with JIB-04 epigenetic inhibitor targeting Jumonji domain histone demethylase enzymes. By ChIP-qPCR, we show that JIB-04 induced transcriptional changes of MECOM by altering H3K27me3 demethylation at its promoter region. We further report that ovarian cancer cells expressing high-MECOM levels exhibit cisplatin resistance, which could be effectively reversed upon pre-treatment with JIB-04. The therapeutic efficacy of JIB-04 was further demonstrated in mice bearing ovarian cancer cell xenografts, where JIB-04 slowed down the tumor growth in corroboration with diminishing MECOM expression. RNA-sequencing analysis identified potential cisplatin resistance gene, SUB1, being regulated by JIB-04-mediated modulation of MECOM expression. Altogether, these data suggest that epigenetic silencing of MECOM by JIB-04 mediated H3K27me3 modulation is an important mechanism in ovarian cancer and provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of ovarian cancers harboring MECOM amplification.",

A computationally efficient algorithm is developed based on proximal gradient descent to facilitate both the transfer and debiasing steps.

Herein, we curated missense mutations occurring in core histone genes in breast cancers using data from MSK-IMPACT and cBioPortal to identify high frequency breast cancer-associated histone gene mutations. We characterized 17 high frequency oncohistone mutations in H2A H2B, and H3 that are enriched in breast cancer samples and occurred at glutamate (E), aspartate (D), serine (S), and arginine (R) residues. Many of these mutants co-occur with <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations in breast cancer samples. The oncohistone mutants were expressed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells or MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells and screened for effects on oncogenic phenotypes in a variety of cell- and tumor-based assays (i.e., proliferation, migration, invasion, competitive outgrowth, transformation). In addition, we examined the effects of selected mutants on DNA damage and gene expression. Our results indicate that the collection of oncohistone mutants that we screened have varying phenotypic and functional effects. Some can promote cancer-related phenotypes, with H2B-E76Q, H3-E97K, and H3-E105K eliciting strong oncogenic phenotypes and alterations in gene expression. All three of these mutants showed cooperativity with an activating mutation in PIK3CA (E545K), or a chemical activator of PI3K\u03b1 (UCL-TRO-1938), in assays of MCF-10A proliferation. H3-E105K also strongly promoted transformation of MCF-10A cells in an assay of growth on low attachment substrate independently of PIK3CA. Our results indicate that some high frequency oncohistone mutants can have oncogenic activity in breast cancers, and may act as potential cancer drivers. Collectively, these observations presented here can be used as a resource to connect biological and molecular outcomes to oncohistones in breast cancers.",

CIN leads to constitutive stimulation of the innate immune cGAS-STING pathway, which has been typically linked to anti-tumor immunity. However, despite the high CIN burden in EAC, the cGAS-STING pathway remains largely intact. To address this paradox, we developed novel esophageal cancer models, including a CIN-isogenic model, discovering myeloid-attracting chemokines - with the chemokine <i>CXCL8</i> (IL-8) as a prominent hit - as conserved CIN-driven targets in EAC. Using high-resolution multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy, we quantified the extent of ongoing cGAS-activating CIN in human EAC tumors by measuring cGAS-positive micronuclei in tumor cells, validated by orthogonal whole-genome sequencing-based CIN metrics. By coupling <i>in situ</i> CIN assessment with single-nucleus RNA sequencing and multiplex immunophenotypic profiling, we found tumor cell-intrinsic innate immune activation and intratumoral myeloid cell inflammation as phenotypic consequences of CIN in EAC. Additionally, we identified increased tumor cell-intrinsic <i>CXCL8</i> expression in CIN<sup>high</sup> EAC, accounting for the inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Using a novel signature of CIN, termed CIN<sup>MN</sup>, which captures ongoing CIN-associated gene expression, we confirm poor patient outcomes in CIN<sup>high</sup> tumors with signs of aberrantly rewired cGAS-STING pathway signaling. Together, our findings help explain the counterintuitive maintenance and expression of cGAS-STING pathway components in aggressive, CIN<sup>high</sup> tumors and emphasize the need to understand the contribution of CIN to the shaping of a pro-tumor immune landscape. Therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting the cGAS-driven inflammation axis may be instrumental in improving patient outcomes in this aggressive cancer.",

Under ER stress, IRE1\u03b1 can splice Xbp1 mRNA enabling translation of this unfolded protein response transcription factor or mediate sequence-specific degradation of mRNAs through regulated IRE1\u03b1-dependent decay (RIDD). Somatic mutations in IRE1\u03b1 occur in many different human cancers including non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). To understand their role in skin cancer pathogenesis, we generated immortalized primary mouse keratinocytes with inducible expression of multiple engineered and cancer-associated mutations, including those present in NMSC. All NMSC mutations tested were activating mutations with elevated autophosphorylation and enhanced RIDD activity relative to the degree of change seen in Xbp1 splicing. Pathway analysis of RNA-Seq data and in vitro studies showed that RNase-impaired mutations enhanced cell migration due to increased levels of active RhoA and the RIDD target Angptl4. In contrast, activating mutations caused elevated Rac1 activation, enrichment of genes involved in DNA repair, increased phospho-ATR levels and improved survival in response to UVB irradiation, a crucial etiological factor for sun-exposure-induced skin cancers. Together, these results suggest divergent roles of IRE1\u03b1 mutations that mediate crucial tumor-promoting events in keratinocytes.",

However, the biological role of LAG3 has not been investigated in pan-cancer datasets. We sought to perform a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of pan-cancer datasets to determine the relationship of LAG3 with patient survival prognosis, tumor microenvironment, immunotherapy responsiveness, and mechanisms regulating tumorigenesis. We used TCGA, GTEx, TIMER2, GDSC, CTRP, and TISCH databases and online websites to extract data on LAG3 in a variety of cancers, and analyzed pan-cancer patient datasets to explore not only the correlation between LAG3 expression and clinical stage, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancers, but also the correlation between LAG3 expression, gene variants, methylation status, tumor stemness, and tumor immunity. The biological functions of LAG3 in osteosarcoma cells were determined by in vitro CCK-8, wound healing and transwell assays. Finally, through in vivo experiments, the study preliminarily explored the impact of LAG3 on osteosarcoma and its correlation with immune genes. Pan-cancer analysis showed that LAG3 expression was up-regulated in a variety of cancers, and the expression of LAG3 was closely related to the clinical stage, diagnosis and prognosis of cancers. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses showed that LAG3 was enriched in inflammatory, metabolic, and immune signaling pathways in a variety of cancers. Meanwhile, LAG3 expression not only has an impact on patient immunotherapy prognosis and immunotherapy response, but also has a significant effect on drug sensitivity. In vitro experiments have shown that LAG3 promotes the proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. In vivo xenotransplantation experiments further confirmed that LAG3 promotes the growth of osteosarcoma, and the expression of LAG3 is positively correlated with CD8, CD19, and CD68. Our study suggests that LAG3 is a promising marker for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.",

Younger patients with TNBC often present with aggressive disease and exhibit distinct tumor microenvironments (TME). We performed spatial profiling to understand the influence of menopausal status on the immune environment, tumor progression, and therapy response. Eleven treatment-naive TNBC tumors were examined in epithelial and non-epithelial areas using digital spatial profiling to identify differentially expressed markers and pathways. Deconvolution methods were employed to identify immune cell subtypes, and the protein expression of T and B cells was confirmed. The prognostic utility of the identified genes and pathways was validated using the METABRIC and SCAN-B datasets. The expression of target genes was analyzed in the I-SPY 2 trial data to understand their influence on the response to specific therapies. Premenopausal tumors formed a distinct cluster characterized by the upregulation of cell activation and antigen presentation pathways. In contrast, T cell checkpoint, cancer antigen, and PI3K-AKT pathways were downregulated. External datasets validated these findings, showing a lower hazard and better prognosis for genes upregulated in premenopausal tumors. An enrichment of CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells, endothelial cells, and monocytes was observed, along with increased intratumoral protein expression of CD8, CD4, and CD20. Premenopausal tumors demonstrated better responses to PARP and HSP90 inhibitors but showed lower sensitivity to Pembrolizumab and PI3K-AKT inhibitors compared to postmenopausal tumors in the I-SPY 2 trial data. Our study underscores the importance of menopausal status in shaping the TME within TNBC, revealing distinct immune landscapes and therapy responses.

Protein and/or mRNA levels of individual RNase H2 subunits are elevated in some cancers, but little is known about the mechanisms or consequences of RNase H2 upregulation. We report that RNase H2 subunits are upregulated at the protein level in response to replication stress induced by oncogenes and chemotherapy drugs in human cancer and non-cancer cell lines. We show that inducible overexpression of the RNASEH2B subunit increases levels of the active RNase H2 heterotrimer. While causing only subtle changes to gene expression, RNASEH2B overexpression is unexpectedly associated with increased RNA:DNA hybrid levels. RNASEH2B overexpression prevents further increases in RNA:DNA hybrid levels by camptothecin or hydroxyurea and reduces replication fork stalling in presence of these drugs. Surprisingly, RNase H2 levels do not strongly impact survival of chemotherapy treatments but appear to have more subtle effects on genome instability and innate immune signalling. In contrast, increased RNase H2 levels in presence of oncogenic HRAS limit not only RAS-induced replication fork stalling but also cell death. Our findings shed new light on the functions of RNase H2 and suggest that upregulation of RNase H2 may be an important aspect of replication stress responses in cancer.",

First, determining the number of signatures is a complex task and depends on heuristics. Second, several signatures lack a clear etiology, raising concerns about whether they result from computational artifacts or actual mutagenic processes. Last, approaches for signature\u00a0assignment are highly influenced by the catalogue of signatures used for the analysis. To overcome these limitations, we introduce RESOLVE (Robust EStimation Of mutationaL signatures Via rEgularization), a framework designed for the efficient extraction, assignment, and confidence estimation of mutational signatures. RESOLVE enables the stratification of cancer genomes according to the active mutational processes, providing insights into those that are consistently shared among various cancer types. We applied RESOLVE to 20\u00a0000 samples from adult and pediatric cancers, providing a comprehensive characterization of subtypes associated with specific mutational processes and alterations in driver genes. Our analysis demonstrates that RESOLVE accurately fits observed mutations with a smaller set of signatures compared to existing catalogues, suggesting the existence of a limited number of dominant mutational processes in cancer genomes. Clustering analysis revealed distinct patient groups characterized by specific signatures, with significant associations between certain signatures and patient prognosis. Additionally, we identified strong associations between signatures and driver gene mutations, offering insights into cancer subtype mechanisms and evolution. Our findings highlight the efficiency of RESOLVE and its potential impact on personalized cancer treatment.",

We conducted multi-dimensional analyses using publicly available databases, including TCGA and GTEx, to evaluate ZNF433's expression patterns, genetic mutations, survival outcomes, immune microenvironment interactions, and diagnostic potential across different cancers. Functional enrichment and protein interaction network analyses were also performed to explore its potential involvement in cancer-related pathways. Our findings revealed that ZNF433 is significantly downregulated in most cancer types, with stage-dependent expression patterns observed in KIRC and KIRP. High expression of ZNF433 was associated with improved overall survival (OS) in HNSC and KIRC, while in ESCA and PRAD, it was correlated with poorer disease-free survival (DFS). Additionally, high ZNF433 levels were linked to better DFS in BRCA, KIRP, THYM, and KIRC. ZNF433 expression was also closely associated with genomic instability markers, including tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and mismatch repair (MMR) deficiencies. Furthermore, ZNF433 exhibited significant regulatory roles within the tumor immune microenvironment. Diagnostic analysis showed that ZNF433 has strong diagnostic potential in LAML and TGCT, and moderate diagnostic value in other cancers.

By binding to its receptor OX40 (CD134), TNFSF4 promotes the proliferation and survival of T cells and plays an important role in the tumor immune microenvironment, but its role in pancreatic cancer is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the expression patterns and prognostic significance of TNF ligand family members in pancreatic cancer (PC), with a specific focus on TNFSF4. We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from the GSE212966 dataset to assess the expression of TNFSF ligands across immune cell types. TCGA-PAAD bulk RNA-seq data were used for non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering to identify molecular subtypes based on TNFSF ligand expression profiles. Immune infiltration was quantified using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to compare overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between subtypes. Immunotherapy response prediction was evaluated using tumor mutational burden (TMB), immunophenoscore (IPS), and tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) scores. Gene expression validation was performed using qRT-PCR. TNFSF ligands were predominantly expressed in antigen-presenting cells, particularly B cells and macrophages. NMF clustering identified two molecular subtypes of PC, with cluster 2 associated with significantly better OS and PFS (p\u2009<\u20090.05). TNFSF4, highly enriched in B cells, was found to regulate immune-related pathways such as B cell receptor signaling and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, as revealed by KEGG pathway analysis. TNFSF4 expression also correlated with favorable immunotherapy markers, suggesting its potential role as a predictive biomarker. These findings were supported by qRT-PCR validation. This study provides a TNFSF ligand-based molecular classification of pancreatic cancer and highlights the immunoregulatory role of TNFSF4. Its association with patient prognosis and immunotherapy responsiveness suggests potential clinical utility in guiding treatment strategies.",

In addition, this study finds that mammalian CARF shares homology with Kip-Related Protein6 (KRP6), a cell cycle inhibitor from higher plant Arabidopsis. KRP6 is regulated by casein kinase1 via phosphorylation at serines 75 and 109, which are conservative in CARF at serines 316 and 356. Systemic assays conducted with various B-cell lymphoma cell lines and a mouse xenograft model demonstrate that the non-phosphorylation variant of CARF inhibited cell proliferation and lymphoma formation more effectively than wild-type CARF, highlighting the crucial regulatory role of phosphorylation at these conserved sites in controlling B-cell lymphoma cell proliferation. A similar suppressive effect is observed with plant KRP6, suggesting a cross-species bioengineering application.

We assessed the expression levels of TNNT1 by employing bioinformatics analyses, including differential gene expression analysis and survival analysis utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The impact of TNNT1 expression on patient prognosis was evaluated through Cox regression analyses. Furthermore, functional enrichment analysis was conducted to explore the biological pathways involved, alongside promoter methylation and mutation analyses, to elucidate its regulatory mechanisms. TNNT1 protein levels were analyzed through immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue microarray (TMA) sections. Our findings demonstrate that TNNT1 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, with elevated expression levels correlating with poor prognosis specifically in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), liver hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Functional analyses indicated that TNNT1 is involved in tumor aggressiveness-related processes such as epidermal development and keratinization. Notably, TNNT1 expression was linked to immune cell infiltration patterns, highlighting its potential role in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment. IHC analysis revealed significantly higher TNNT1 levels in COAD and rectum adenocarcinoma tissues compared to control samples.

          "abstract": "In ~70% of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the <i>TP53</i> gene acquires gain-of-function (GOF) mutations leading to rapid disease progression. Specifically, missense p53 (misp53) GOF mutations associate with therapy resistance and worse clinical outcomes. However, the molecular functions of distinct misp53 mutants in plasticity and therapy response remain unclear. Integrating multicenter patient data and multi-omics, we report that the misp53<sup>R273H/C</sup> mutant is associated with cell cycle progression and a basal-like state compared to the misp53<sup>R248W/Q</sup> mutant. Loss of misp53<sup>R273H/C</sup> decreased tumor growth and liver metastasis while prolonging survival in preclinical models. We found that misp53<sup>R273H/C</sup> specifically regulated the Rb/DREAM axis involved in cell cycle regulation. Notably, a clinical CDK4/6 inhibitor reduced misp53<sup>R273H/C</sup> mutant expression. However, it triggered MAPK/ERK-mediated resistance mechanisms, enhancing cell survival and resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Combining MAPK/ERK and CDK4/6 inhibitors reduced misp53<sup>R273H/C</sup>-associated oncogenic functions. Thus, distinct misp53 mutants show unique cell-intrinsic plasticity, therapeutic vulnerabilities, and resistance mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Esophageal cancer (ESCA) is a highly aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis. Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide B2 (SNRPB2) is a core component of the spliceosome involved in pre-mRNA splicing. However, its role in tumor development and progression remains largely unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical relevance and prognostic value of SNRPB2 in ESCA. SNRPB2 mRNA expression and genetic alterations were analyzed using GEPIA2 and cBioPortal. Protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues. Functional assays in ESCC cell lines were conducted to determine the biological role of SNRPB2. Immune-related and functional analyses were performed using TIMER, TISIDB, TISCH, Gene Ontology (GO), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Cycloheximide (CHX) chase assays were used to assess protein stability. SNRPB2 mRNA was upregulated in ESCA and associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Immunohistochemistry confirmed high SNRPB2 protein expression in ESCC, correlating with vessel carcinoma embolus, lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, and tumor grade. SNRPB2 knockdown significantly inhibited ESCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. GSEA indicated that SNRPB2 suppresses the Rb/E2F pathway. Mechanistically, SNRPB2 stabilized E2F4 protein by preventing its proteasomal degradation, and E2F4 overexpression reversed the tumor-suppressive effects of SNRPB2 silencing. Immune analyses showed that SNRPB2 expression correlated with increased infiltration of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes, as well as immune-related genes including <i>PDCD1</i>, <i>CD274</i>, <i>CTLA4</i>, <i>HLA-DRA</i>, and <i>B2M</i>. These findings suggest a dual role for SNRPB2 in promoting tumor progression and modulating the immune microenvironment in ESCA. SNRPB2 promotes ESCC progression by stabilizing E2F4 and regulating cell cycle genes. It is also associated with immune infiltration and gene expression in ESCA. SNRPB2 may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in esophageal cancer.",

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma is an aggressive and incurable type of brain cancer. Regions of tissue necrosis are a distinctive pathological feature of this cancer. These arise through thrombosis of tumor vasculature, driven by tumor-derived pro-coagulation factors. In studies of transglutaminase 2 (TGM2), we observed that TGM2 mRNA expression in glioblastoma was primarily in a subset of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells with hypoxia gene expression signatures. Analysis of xenograft and human glioblastoma samples by immunohistochemistry showed that macrophages in the vicinity of necrotic regions expressed very high levels of TGM2. These macrophages were engaged in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, a process known as efferocytosis. In cell culture, incubation of macrophages with apoptotic cells induced TGM2 expression in macrophages, and TGM2 inhibitors blocked efferocytosis. In patient-derived glioblastoma organoids cultured in 5% O<sub>2</sub>, a basal level of apoptosis was observed, and endogenous macrophages were observed in the process of clearing apoptotic cells. Clearance of apoptotic cells was reduced in organoids treated with a TGM2 inhibitor. Efferocytosis was absent or reduced in organoids grown in 20% O<sub>2</sub>. These data, together with previous work, define a model in which necrotic regions in glioblastoma induce hypoxia-driven apoptosis, which in turn promotes efferocytosis by macrophages. TGM2 is both a marker of efferocytosis and a target for efferocytosis inhibition in this process. Efferocytosis is a potent immunosuppressive mechanism, so this process provides an additional mechanism by which large glioblastoma tumors can evade immune responses.",

The original datasets were acquired from TCGA and GEO databases. PABPN1 expression analysis was conducted utilizing the Oncomine, TIMER, GEPIA, and BioGPS databases. Prognostic implications of PABPN1 were assessed through GEPIA, Kaplan-Meier plotter, and the PrognoScan database. Correlations between PABPN1 expression and immune checkpoints (ICP), tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and neoantigens in human cancers were examined using the SangerBox database. Additionally, the association between PABPN1 and marker genes of tumor-infiltrated immune cells in urogenital cancers was confirmed. Differential expression of PABPN1 in urogenital cancers with distinct clinical characteristics was assessed using the UALCAN database. Finally, experiments of T24, 5637, HLF and MCF-7 cells were performed to verify the above results. The expression of PABPN1 tended to be higher in human cancers compared to paired normal tissues. Its expression levels showed strong associations with TMB, MSI, and neoantigens. Additionally, significant correlations existed between PABPN1 expression and tumor immune-infiltrated cells (TILs) in many human cancers, with marker genes of TILs showing significant relationships with PABPN1 expression, particularly in urogenital cancers. The coexpression networks of PABPN1 were predominantly involved in the regulation of immune response, antigen processing, and presentation. After down expression of PABPN1, mRNA expression levels of MRPS15 and GPx (Glutathione peroxidase) decreased significantly in T24, 5637 HLF and MCF-7 cells. PABPN1 was expected to be an important role element in cancer research, serving as a potential prognostic and immunological pan-cancer biomarker.",

          "abstract": "Individuals with disabilities participate notably less in the scientific workforce. While the reasons for this discrepancy are multifaceted, accessibility of knowledge is likely a factor. In the life sciences, digital resources play an important role in gaining new knowledge and conducting data-driven research. However, there is little data on how accessible essential life sciences resources are for people with disabilities. Our work is the first to comprehensively evaluate the accessibility of life sciences resources. To understand the current state of accessibility of digital data resources in the life sciences, we pose three research questions: (1) What are the most common accessibility issues?; (2) What factors may have contributed to the current state of accessibility?; and (3) What is the potential impact of accessibility issues in real-world use cases? To answer these questions, we collected large-scale accessibility data about two essential resources: data portals (n\u2009=\u20093,112) and journal websites (n\u2009=\u20095,099). Our analysis shows that many life sciences resources contain severe accessibility issues (74.8% of data portals and 69.1% of journal websites) and are significantly less accessible than US government websites, which we used as a baseline. Focusing on visual impairment, we further conducted a preliminary study to evaluate three data portals in-depth with a blind user, unveiling the practical impact of the identified accessibility issues on common tasks (53.3% success rate), such as data discovery tasks. Based on our results, we find that simply implementing accessibility standards does not guarantee real-world accessibility of life sciences data resources. We believe that our data and analysis results bring insights into how the scientific community can address critical accessibility barriers and increase awareness of accessibility, leading to more inclusive life sciences research and education.

However, the effects of RNA modification-related genes (RRGs) in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) have not been fully elucidated. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of RRGs on OSCC development progression. RNA-seq transcriptome data, along with clinical and prognostic information, were extracted for 328 patients with OSCC from the TCGA database. A total of 49 RRGs were analyzed for differential expression. We then performed Lasso analysis, as well as univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, followed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to identify relevant prognostic genes and establish a risk-prognosis model. Patients were categorized into high-risk and low-risk groups, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to analyze differences in gene signatures between these two groups, using data from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. RT-PCR was employed to validate the expression levels of differentially expressed genes in OSCC samples. The four most significantly differentially expressed genes were selected for further functional analysis, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) vectors targeting these genes were transfected into OSCC CAL27 cells. The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to evaluate cell proliferation. Additionally, a subcutaneous CAL27 xenograft model transfected with short hairpin RNA (shRNA), combined with Ki-67 immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and TUNEL assay, was used to investigate their underlying molecular mechanisms in vivo. Among the 49 RRGs, four genes (IGF2BP2, HNRNPC, NAT10, and TRMT61B) were found to be associated with the development of OSCC. Based on various methodological validations, a risk score model was constructed using these four genes. The high-risk and low-risk groups of OSCC patients exhibited significantly different survival outcomes and clinicopathological characteristics. Patients in the low-risk group had longer overall survival (OS) and lower mortality rates compared to those in the high-risk group. The nomogram and decision curve analysis (DCA) demonstrated that our risk model accurately and reliably predicted the impact of risk factors on OS at 1-, 3-, and 5-year. Additionally, risk scores correlated with the infiltration of several immune cells, particularly CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and B cells, which showed significant negative correlations. Furthermore, the results of the CCK-8 assay indicated that inhibition of NAT10 and IGF2BP2 expression using siRNA inhibited the\u00a0proliferation of OSCC cell lines in vitro. Meanwhile, inhibition of NAT10 and IGF2BP2 expression using shRNA influenced proliferation of tumorigenicity in vivo. In this study, we established a risk model and nomogram based on four RRGs, which can be used for risk stratification and predicting survival outcomes in patients with OSCC. This provides a reliable reference for individualized therapy in OSCC patients.",

AR upregulates ZFHX3 transcription, but whether and how ZFHX3 plays a role in the AR signaling is unknown. RNA-seq was used to identify AR target genes that were also affected by ZFHX3 loss. Gene expression changes were verified using western blotting and qPCR. Immunoprecipitation, luciferase promoter-reporter assay, and western blotting were performed to assess ZFHX3's impact on AR transcriptional activity and ZFHX3 and AR protein interaction. Cell proliferation and colony formation assays were used to evaluate ZFHX3's impact on AR function. Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed the association of AR/ZFHX3 expression with patient survival. ZFHX3 loss in C4-2B/LNCaP cells downregulated classic AR target genes such as KLK3, FKBP5, and TMPRSS2 while upregulating some unclassical AR target genes (e.g., TNK1, ADAM7, and MAPRE2). ZFHX3 protein bound AR via multiple regions, particularly residues 1-223. ZFHX3 loss promoted cell proliferation/colony formation and attenuated enzalutamide's efficacy. Higher AR expression levels correlated with worse disease-free survival only in lower-ZFHX3 prostate cancer patients. Biochemically, ZFHX3's absence weakened AR's transactivity, including AR's binding to target gene promoters. These findings suggest that ZFHX3 is integral for AR signaling in prostate epithelial cells. ZFHX3 loss, which occurs in advanced prostate cancer, affects AR's function in gene transcription and could thus compromise PSA/KLK3 utility in prostate cancer detection.",

Recent progress in generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising opportunity to address this challenge by enabling the design of hit-like anti-cancer molecules conditioned on complex genomic features. We present Genotype-to-Drug Diffusion (G2D-Diff), a generative AI approach for creating small molecule-based drug structures tailored to specific cancer genotypes. G2D-Diff demonstrates exceptional performance in generating diverse, drug-like compounds that meet desired efficacy conditions for a given genotype. The model outperforms existing methods in diversity, feasibility, and condition fitness. G2D-Diff learns directly from drug response data distributions, ensuring reliable candidate generation without separate predictors. Its attention mechanism provides insights into potential cancer targets and pathways, enhancing interpretability. In triple-negative breast cancer case studies, G2D-Diff generated plausible hit-like candidates by focusing on relevant pathways. By combining realistic hit-like molecule generation with relevant pathway suggestions for specific genotypes, G2D-Diff represents a significant advance in AI-guided, personalized drug discovery.

This study leverages comprehensive bioinformatic analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data to uncover novel ITH-associated prognostic markers in breast cancer. Using the DEPTH2 algorithm for ITH scoring, we demonstrated that high-ITH tumors correlate significantly with poor overall survival. Through differential expression analysis between high- and low-ITH groups, we discovered and validated a novel three-gene signature (CLIC6, SUSD3, and LTF) using Cox regression and stepAIC methodology. External validation using the METABRIC cohort confirmed the signature's robust prognostic significance. Notably, our signature revealed previously unrecognized associations between ITH and the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), suggesting potential therapeutic implications. Further analysis uncovered significant associations between our ITH-based signature and specific cancer hallmarks, genetic alterations, and clinicopathological features. Our findings not only establish a practical prognostic tool but also provide novel insights into the intricate relationship between tumor heterogeneity and the microenvironment, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for personalized breast cancer treatment.",

However, current frontline treatment modalities fail to achieve satisfactory therapeutic outcomes. In recent years, T-cell receptor (TCR)-T therapy has garnered increasing attention as a promising therapeutic approach. This review provides an overview of the epidemiology of HCC, evaluates the efficacy of current first-line treatment options, and introduces adoptive cellular therapies (ACTs), with a specific focus on TCR-T therapy. Notably, we categorize existing TCR-T research targeting different antigens for the treatment of HCC, covering both published literature and registered clinical trials. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of current TCR-T research and applications, while offering insights into future research directions and development prospects. In summary, this review comprehensively examines the research progress on TCR-T therapy for HCC from the perspective of antigen targeting. Although several challenges remain to be addressed, we believe that TCR-T therapy represents a promising approach for the treatment of HCC.",

          "abstract": "Lung cancer remains the malignancy with the highest morbidity and mortality worldwide. There are no effective guiding therapies and prognosis biomarkers, and the overall prognosis of lung cancer remains poor. The cardiomyocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF-2) family is a highly evolutionarily conserved transcription factor that plays important roles in a variety of diseases, including tumors. Still, the overall bioinformatics function of the MEF-2 gene family in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been systematically reported yet. MEF-2 family members have low expression in NSCLC tissues and are associated with clinicopathological stages. MEF-2B/2D is highly expressed in lung metastatic tissues. MEF-2A, MEF-2B, and MEF-2D have obvious advantages in the diagnosis of NSCLC. Survival analysis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database shows that MEF-2C is strongly associated with poor overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses demonstrated that MEF-2A independently predicts the progression-free interval (PFI) in NSCLC patients. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that MEF-2 family members are associated with immune cell receptor function and regulation of immunoglobulin complexes. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with MEF-2 family members were significantly enriched in the cAMP signaling pathway and gastric acid secretion. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed DEGs that play critical roles in the cytochrome-c oxidase activity, electron transfer activity, oxidoreduction-driven active transmembrane transporter activity; the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis shows that they are mainly enriched in oxidative phosphorylation, thermogenesis, and diabetic cardiomyopathy. MEF-2A is a potential diagnostic, prognostic biomarker, and promising therapeutic target for NSCLC. Further studies are needed to verify and clarify the underlying mechanisms.",

Hippo signalling perturbation is associated with several human diseases, particularly various solid cancers. Hippo pathway-targeted therapies are beginning to emerge for the treatment of cancer, most of which are focused on disrupting the ability of the YAP and TAZ transcription co-activator proteins to promote transcription of genes with their cognate TEAD1-4 DNA binding proteins. Recently, TEAD inhibitors have shown promise in a phase I clinical trial in cancers that are enriched for Hippo pathway mutations, such as mesothelioma. Moreover, Hippo\u00a0pathway-targeted therapies have great potential to be combined with RAS-MAPK pathway inhibitors, given the close functional relationship that these signalling pathways share in development and disease.",

To explore the molecular mechanisms by which NOTCH1 regulates cisplatin sensitivity in TNBC cells, and to validate its synergistic effect with NT5E. Expression of NOTCH1 in MDA-MB-231 cells was silenced using RNA interference, and the changes in cell proliferation, migration and cisplatin sensitivity were measured in combination with cell function experiments. The regulatory relationship between NOTCH1 and NT5E was analyzed using qPCR and Western blotting, and the silencing effect of NOTCH1 was verified using NT5E overexpression experiments. Knockdown of NOTCH1 hindered the growth and motility of TNBC cells and lowered cisplatin's half-maximal inhibitory concentration. Expression of NOTCH1 and NT5E was positively correlated, and NOTCH1 silencing led to a decrease in the expression of NT5E. Elevated NT5E expression attenuated the suppressive effects of NOTCH1 knockdown on both cell proliferation and cisplatin response. NOTCH1 enhances TNBC cisplatin chemosensitivity by regulating NT5E expression. This study provides a new target and experimental basis for the development of combination therapy strategies for TNBC.",

          "abstract": "Cancer remains a significant global health burden, underscoring the need for innovative diagnostic tools to enable early detection and improve patient outcomes. While circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation has emerged as a promising biomarker for noninvasive cancer diagnostics, existing methods often face limitations in handling the high-dimensionality of methylation data, small sample sizes, and a lack of biological interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose cfMethylPre, a novel deep transfer learning framework tailored for cancer detection using cfDNA methylation data. cfMethylPre leverages large language model pretrained embeddings from DNA sequence information and integrates them with methylation profiles to enhance feature representation. The deep transfer learning process involves pretraining on bulk DNA methylation data encompassing 2801 samples across 82 cancer types and normal controls, followed by fine-tuning with cfDNA methylation data. This approach ensures robust adaptation to cfDNA's unique characteristics while improving predictive accuracy. Our model achieved superior predictive accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods, with a weighted Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.926 and a weighted F1-score of 0.942. Through model interpretation and biological experimental validation, we identified three novel breast cancer genes-PCDHA10, PRICKLE2, and PRTG-demonstrating their inhibitory effects on cell proliferation and migration in breast cancer cell lines. These findings establish cfMethylPre as a powerful and interpretable tool for cancer diagnostics and biological discovery, paving the way for its application in precision oncology.",

Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new biomarker for combined immunotherapy strategies to maximize the clinical benefits. We collected and investigated 34 pan-cancer scRNA-Seq cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 10 bulk RNA-Seq cohorts utilizing multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms to identify and verify a representative EGFR-related gene signature (EGFR.Sig) as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy response. Core genes were identified as Hub-EGFR.Sig to predict the prognosis of cancers and to understand the crosstalk between EGFR and the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). EGFR.Sig can accurately predict the ICI response with an AUC of 0.77, demonstrating superior predictive performance compared to previously established signatures. Twelve core genes in EGFR.Sig were identified as Hub-EGFR.Sig, of which 4 immune resistance genes were previously verified in different CRISPR cohorts. Notably, the prognosis most related to Hub-EGFR.Sig was bladder cancer, which can be divided into two clusters with different responses to immunotherapy based on Hub-EGFR.Sig. We developed a promising pan-cancer signature based on EGFR-related genes to serve as a biomarker for immunotherapy response and survival outcome prediction. Furthermore, core genes were identified for future targeting, which will pave the way for improving the effect of immunotherapy in the context of combination immunotherapies.",

Transcriptomic studies were carried out using USC Xena and R, while in vitro assays were performed with the glioblastoma human cell line U251 and the commercial RIPK1 inhibitor GSK2982772. The results showed that high RIPK1 expression was linked to a lower survival probability in patients. Additionally, the RIPK1 expression was higher in the wtIDH samples compared to that in the mIDH samples. Significant differences in the expression of genes related to cellular dedifferentiation, proinflammatory cell death pathways, and tumor-infiltrating immune cells were found between high- and low-RIPK1 expression groups. To further characterize the role of RIPK1 in DG, the effects of the RIPK1 inhibitor were evaluated, alone or combined with cisplatin, on glioblastoma cell proliferation and apoptosis. The combined treatments effectively reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. The overexpression of RIPK1 was associated with a poor prognosis for DG, suggesting that RIPK1 plays a critical role in glioma pathogenesis and should be considered in therapeutic decision-making.",

Some grade 1 tumours exhibit increased clinical aggressiveness, with the biallelic mutation of NF2 being the most frequently reported. In our study, we analysed the most common driver mutations (NF2, AKT1, KLF4, and TRAF7) in meningioma by genomics describing co-occurrences and new mutations. Furthermore, tumour tissue bearing the driver mutations was analysed by proteomics. The relevance of the specific target found in the most common driver mutation in meningiomas (NF2) was validated in vitro using both lower and higher-grade meningioma and further, the higher-grade meningioma was analysed in vivo using an NOD scid gamma (NSG) mouse model. Our genomic data revealed co-occurrences of non-NF2 mutations in lower-grade meningiomas, suggesting synergistic effects supporting tumour growth. NF2<sup>-/-</sup> meningiomas showed distinct proteomic clustering, with different mutations found in these clusters. Additionally, proteomics identified Annexin-3 (ANXA3) upregulated in NF2<sup>-/-</sup> meningioma.

          "abstract": "Targeted sequencing is critical in cancer diagnosis, treatment selection, and monitoring. However, the effectiveness of these methods for reflecting whole-exome sequencing (WES)-level mutational signatures remains unclear. Therefore, we addressed this issue through simulation-based analysis to clarify how well targeted sequencing can reproduce WES-level mutational signatures. We compared the correlation and similarity of mutational signatures between whole-exome sequencing-level mutation data and downsampled data for gene sets targeted by each sequencing method in 13 cancer types. Additionally, a similarity analysis of the mutational signatures was conducted using randomly downsampled data. The comparison between whole-exome sequencing and targeted sequencing showed a low correlation based on Pearson's correlation coefficient but a high similarity based on the Dice similarity index. As a result of the downsampling of data with cancer-related genes and whole genes to evaluate similarity, the cancer-related gene random set showed high similarity when 200-400 genes were selected. However, the whole-genome random set required 2-3 times as many genes as the cancer-related gene random set to show high similarity. Among cancer types, colorectal and lung cancers demonstrated high similarity with fewer downsampled genes, whereas breast and prostate cancers required more downsampled genes to achieve high similarity. This study demonstrated that current clinically used targeted sequencing methods can reflect whole-exome sequencing-level mutational signatures. This suggests that considering the cancer type and average number of gene mutations in each patient when selecting targeted sequencing methods can lead to more effective treatment choices.",

          "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are highly aggressive sarcomas with poor prognosis. The enzyme methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is lost in \u223c25% to 50% of MPNSTs, which is associated with loss of the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A. Inhibition of PRMT5 was found to be synthetically lethal in cells with MTAP loss due to accumulation of the substrate methylthioadenosine (MTA), an endogenous PRMT5 inhibitor. TNG908 and TNG462 are clinical-stage MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors that demonstrate selectivity for MTAP-deleted (null) cells over MTAP-proficient [wild-type (WT)] cells. Both compounds drive durable tumor regressions in various cancer xenograft models with MTAP loss. The proliferative effects of TNG908 and TNG462 on MTAP-null and MTAP WT MPNST cell lines were examined using CellTiter-Glo assays. Target inhibition was verified by western blot. TNG908 and TNG462 were further profiled in two MTAP-null MPNST patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. We identified homozygous loss of the MTAP gene in \u223c54% (7/13) of MPNST PDX lines. Two MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors, TNG908 and TNG462, reduced cell viability in MTAP-null, but not MTAP WT, HAP1 MTAP-isogenic cell lines. TNG908 and TNG462 selectively decreased cell viability and stimulated cell death in MTAP-null MPNST cells compared with MTAP WT MPNST cells. Finally, TNG908 and TNG462 drove dose-dependent antitumor activity, including tumor regressions in two MTAP-null MPNST PDX models, WU-356 and WU-386, at well-tolerated doses. Clinical-stage MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors TNG908 and TNG462 are efficacious in MPNST models in vitro and in vivo; therefore, MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors are promising therapeutic agents for patients with MTAP-deleted MPNSTs.

          "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is a highly lethal malignancy with a high incidence and mortality rate globally. Its development follows the Correa model, with intestinal metaplasia (IM) being a critical precursor to GC. However, the mechanisms underlying IM progression to GC remain unclear. This study explored extracellular matrix (ECM)-related gene changes during IM progression to GC, aiming to identify biomarkers that could improve early diagnosis and treatment strategies for GC, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. To analyze transcriptome sequencing data, molecular biomarkers that can predict GC risk and monitor IM progression can be identified, providing new insights and strategies for preventing IM-GC transformation. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis served for confirming gene modules. Upregulated ECM-related genes were further tested using univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis to select hub genes and construct a survival analysis model. The intestinal cell model was established by stimulating GES-1 cells with chenodeoxycholic acid. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified 1709 differentially expressed genes from the GSE191275 dataset, while The Cancer Genome Atlas stomach adenocarcinoma revealed 4633 differentially expressed genes. The intersection of these datasets identified 71 upregulated and 171 downregulated genes, which were enriched in ECM-related pathways. Univariate Cox regression analysis identified six genes with prognostic significance, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression pinpointed secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine <i>(SPARC)</i> and <i>SERPINE1</i> as non-zero coefficient genes. A prognostic model integrating clinical tumor node metastasis staging, age, <i>SERPINE1</i>, and <i>SPARC</i> was constructed. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed an increasing expression of SPARC protein from normal gastric mucosa (-), to IM (+- to +), and to GC (+ to ++), with significant differences (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Western blot analysis demonstrated significantly higher SPARC expression in induced intestinal cells compared to GES-1. Furthermore, after <i>SPARC</i> knockdown in the human GC cell line HGC27, cell counting kit-8 and colony formation assays showed a reduction in cell proliferative ability, while the wound healing assay revealed impaired cell migration capacity. Comprehensive analysis suggested that a model incorporating clinical tumor node metastasis staging, age, and <i>SPARC</i>/<i>SERPINE1</i> expression served as a prognostic predictor for GC. Moreover, elevated SPARC expression in IM and GC suggests its potential as a proper biomarker to detect GC in early stage and as a novel therapeutic target, guiding clinical applications.",

          "abstract": "The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) occurs in many colorectal cancers (CRCs). CIMP is closely associated with global hypermethylation and tends to occur in proximal tumours with microsatellite instability (MSI), but its origins have been obscure. A few CRCs carry oncogenic (gain-of-function) mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase IDH1. Whilst IDH1 is an established CRC driver gene, the low frequency of IDH1-mutant CRCs (about 0.5%) has meant that the effects and molecular covariates of those mutations have not been established. We first showed\u00a0computationally that IDH2 is also a CRC driver. Using multiple public and in-house CRC datasets, we then identified IDH mutations at the hotspots (IDH1 codons 132 and IDH2 codons 140 and 172) frequently mutated in other tumour types. Somatic IDH mutations were associated with BRAF mutations and expression of mucinous/goblet cell markers, but not with KRAS mutations or MSI. All IDH-mutant CRCs were CIMP-positive, mostly at a high level. Cell and mouse models showed that IDH mutation was plausibly causal for DNA hypermethylation. Whilst the aetiology of hypermethylation generally remains unexplained, IDH-mutant tumours did not form a discrete methylation subcluster, suggesting that different underlying mechanisms can converge on similar final methylation phenotypes. Although further analysis is required, IDH mutations may be the first cause of hypermethylation to be identified in a common cancer type, providing evidence that CIMP and DNA methylation represent more than aging-related epiphenomena. Cautious exploration of mutant IDH inhibitors and DNA demethylating agents is suggested in managing IDH-mutant CRCs. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

          "abstract": "Aberrant changes in protein phosphorylation are a hallmark of cancer, often leading to hyperactivation of signalling pathways such as the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Although kinase inhibitors are successfully used in certain clinical indications, drug resistance remains a challenge, and alternative approaches to control phosphorylation-dependent oncogenic signalling are increasingly being considered. These include the modulation of negative regulators of oncogenic signalling pathways. The dual-specificity phosphatase 2 (DUSP2) is one of the essential negative regulators for the MAPK pathway, providing tight and efficient control of MAPKs under physiological conditions. However, in oncogenic contexts, negative feedback regulation is often impaired and the mechanisms controlling DUSP2 expression and function remain largely elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether microRNA-mediated regulation of DUSP2 could contribute to an impairment of negative feedback regulation in cancer. A combination of in silico target prediction, integrative analysis of pan-cancer microRNA and DUSP2 mRNA expression data as well as a literature search was applied to identify microRNAs potentially regulating DUSP2 expression in cancer context. Predicted interactions of microRNAs with the DUSP2 3'UTR were verified using reporter gene assays and functionally validated in a lymphoma cell model. A comprehensive analysis of microRNA and DUSP2 mRNA expression data across 32 cancer types revealed significant inverse correlations between oncogenic microRNA clusters (miR-17-92, miR-106a-363, and miR-106b-25 cluster) and DUSP2 expression in various cancer types. Reporter gene assay analysis confirmed the interaction of miR-17-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-20b-5p, miR-29b-3p, miR-93-5p, miR-106b-5p, miR-122-5p, miR-340-5p, miR-520a-3p, and miR-520c-3p with the DUSP2 mRNA 3'UTR. Furthermore, treatment of the lymphoma cell line WSU-DLCL2 with microRNA inhibitors for miR-17-5p, miR-20b-5p, or miR-106b-5p resulted in increased DUSP2 mRNA levels. The results of this study indicate that microRNA-mediated regulation of DUSP2 in hematologic and solid cancers appears to be a plausible mechanism that contributes to the dysregulation of MAP kinase signaling pathways in cancer by impairing negative feedback regulation. The data provide a solid foundation for future studies to investigate the consequences of regulation of DUSP function in cancer in more depth.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is a significant malignancy characterized by a high global incidence and a propensity for recurrence. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) genes comprise a collection of genes that participate in the drug ADME. Understanding the role and prognostic value of ARGs (ADME related genes) in BC advancement is critical for personalized therapy. Therefore, an ARPS (ADME related prognostic signature) was created in this study to examine the clinical implications of ARGs in patients with BC. A multi-omics investigation of ADME-related genes in BC was conducted using bulk RNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and spatial transcriptome data. According to the expression profiles of ADME-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the ARPS was calculated, and all patients were stratified based on their risk scores. A prediction model was then created using Cox regression and stepAIC analyses. This model divided all patients into HR (High risk) and LR (Low risk) groups following the median risk score. Bioinformatics analyses were conducted to estimate the risk signature's predictive capacity. This study identified five ARGs (SLC7A5, HSD11B1, ADHFE1, GSTM2, and TAP1) correlated with BC prognosis. The risk signature in the TCGA-BRCA, METABRIC, and GSE58812 cohorts revealed robust predictive accuracy for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival. Compared to the gene signature alone, the nomogram integrating the ARPS and clinical parameters demonstrated improved prognostic performance. Immune infiltration analysis revealed a high level of immune checkpoint related gene expression and immune score in patients with ARPS LR, suggesting potential implications for immunotherapy responses. The findings highlight the prognostic significance of ARPS in BC and its potential utility in guiding personalized treatment strategies. Combining ARPS with clinical parameters enhances prognostic accuracy and may help patients with BC make clinical decisions.",

          "abstract": "There is a strong association between cholesterol reprogramming and cancer development. However, 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid \u039424-reductase (DHCR24), the final enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, has been relatively understudied in cancer progression. The present study aimed to perform a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of DHCR24 to elucidate its role across different malignancies. The interacting proteins of DHCR24 were identified by molecular docking node dynamics simulation. Duolink proximity ligation, cell viability and filipin staining assays were used to assess the function of DHCR24 in cancer cells and its underlying oncogenic mechanisms. The findings revealed that DHCR24 exhibits high expression in seven cancer types (bladder cancer, breast invasive carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma), and low expression in five others (glioblastoma multiforme, kidney chromophobe, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma), suggesting that DHCR24 serves distinct roles depending on the cancer type. Notably, it was demonstrated that DHCR24 expression consistently increases with tumor stage and serves as an independent prognostic factor in BLCA. Moreover, molecular docking and kinetic modeling identified HRAS as a key interacting protein of DHCR24. The Duolink assay further demonstrated that DHCR24 interacts with HRAS outside the nucleus in 5637 human BLCA cells. Filipin fluorescence staining and cell proliferation assays also revealed that this interaction promoted cholesterol synthesis, contributing to cancer cell proliferation in the 5637 cells. In conclusion, the results of the present study provide novel insights into the oncogenic role of DHCR24 in BLCA and demonstrates its interaction with HRAS for the first time to the best of our knowledge, highlighting a potential mechanism driving tumor progression.",

          "abstract": "Cellular senescence, an irreversible cell cycle arrest, plays a pivotal role in development, aging, and tumor suppression. However, the fundamental pathway coordinating senescence and neoplastic transformation remains unclear. Here, we describe the tumorigenic involvement of ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 4 (UBR4), an E3 ubiquitin ligase of the N-degron pathway, in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Public genome databases revealed high UBR4 expression in LUAD patients, associated with a dysregulated cell cycle and impaired mitochondrial homeostasis. <i>UBR4</i> knockout (\u0394UBR4) in A549 lung cancer cells induced cellular senescence with defective mitochondria. Restoration of UBR4 or antioxidant treatment reversed the \u0394UBR4 phenotypes caused by impaired mitophagy. Mitochondrial stress exacerbated mitochondrial dysfunction in \u0394UBR4 cells, contributing to diverse cellular phenotypes. Additionally, \u0394UBR4 cells exhibited substantially slow tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. In LUAD patients, UBR4 levels correlated with tumor stage, mitophagy markers, and poor survival. These findings suggest a tumor-promoting function of UBR4 in LUAD by regulating mitochondrial quality control. Further research into the pharmacological inhibition of UBR4 could open promising avenues for developing effective antitumor therapies targeting LUAD.",

Our data demonstrate not only that an individual increase in the levels of Aurora B or INCENP have a different impact on the cells, but more importantly that their simultaneous overexpression stabilizes both CPC components, exacerbates Aurora B activity, severely impairs mitotic progression and chromosome dynamics, and has a distinctive and more dramatic effect on the transcriptional landscape of the cells.",

However, upon TLR7/8 activation by imiquimod, pDCs have been shown to acquire tumor-killing abilities. In this study, by performing multi-omics profiling of imiquimod-stimulated murine bone marrow-derived pDCs (BM-pDCs), we identified MAPKs, JAK/STAT, and NF-\u03baB pathways as critical mediators of the killing function. Analysis of secreted and surface markers in perturbed BM-pDCs revealed that a complex signaling network is necessary to shape the cytotoxic phenotype of imiquimod-activated BM-pDCs. While JNK inhibition reduces killing via secreted factors, p38 inhibition enhances cell-mediated killing. Instead, NF-\u03baB inhibition boosts whereas Tyk2 deficiency reduces both cell- and secreted factors-mediated killing. Data integration identified a pDC killing gene signature with prognostic value in melanoma patients. These results will be instrumental to design further functional studies and clinical approaches to harness the anti-tumorigenic functions of pDCs, in turn improving cancer patients' outcome.",

          "abstract": "Members of the MEX3 RNA-binding protein family have been widely recognized as critical in the development and progression of cancer. However, the specific role of MEX3 in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) remains largely unexplored. This study aims to exploring the potential functions and mechanisms of MEX3 family genes in LIHC. To address this gap, we performed a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis using various tools and databases, including the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, R software, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, cBioPortal, LinkedOmics, Metascape, TIMER, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and nomogram. Furthermore, the protein levels of MEX3 family were assessed by Western blot and the Human Protein Atlas. Our analyses revealed that MEX3 family genes were significantly overexpressed in multiple types of tumor tissues, particularly in LIHC. Specifically, MEX3A was highly expressed in Asian populations, while MEX3B/C/D showed increased expression in tumors of higher grades and advanced clinical stages. High expression of MEX3A correlated with poor survival outcomes; MEX3C/D showed partial associations with poor survival, whereas MEX3B indicated a favorable trend. Mutations in the <i>MEX3A</i> gene were frequently observed and were strongly associated with hypoxic conditions, increased incidence of adverse clinical symptoms, and a poorer prognosis. The enrichment analysis of co-expressed genes within the MEX3 family revealed involvement in cell cycle regulation, transcriptional control, and various oncogenic pathways. Additionally, correlations were observed between the expression levels of MEX3 family genes and key driver genes such as <i>MMP14</i>, <i>TET3</i>, <i>SENP1</i>, <i>GTSE1</i>, and <i>KIF18A</i>. Furthermore, upregulation of MEX3 family gene expression was associated with increased T helper cells, Th2 cells, and other infiltrating immune lymphocytes. The ROC curve indicated that MEX3A had optimal predictive value for LIHC. Moreover, there were differences in the expression levels of MEX3 family genes and proteins, suggesting that post-translational modifications may play a crucial role in regulating their protein levels. Our findings suggest that the MEX3 family is associated with the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma patients and contributes to disease progression by modulating the cell cycle and protein post-transcriptional modifications. Furthermore, this family is related to the tumor microenvironment, particularly in hypoxia and immune responses, which holds significant value for predicting liver cancer outcomes.",

Nevertheless, clinically applicable tools for predicting patient prognosis based on ITH remain unavailable, and the association between ITH and immune cell response is a matter of debate. The objective of this study was to establish ITH as a clinically relevant biomarker capable of predicting outcomes and informing treatment strategies in ccRCC. The Bioconductor R package Maftools was used to analyze somatic variants of ccRCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT) was used to estimate immune cell compositions. A mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH) algorithm was used to measure ITH, and we explored its correlation with clinical parameters and immune cell response. Our analysis revealed that lower MATH values were significantly associated with increased infiltration of activated dendritic cells (P=0.048) and reduced levels of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs; P=0.02), suggesting enhanced antitumor immunity in less heterogeneous tumors. Conversely, high MATH values correlated with worse overall survival and a suppressed immune microenvironment. These findings support the potential of MATH as a stratification biomarker for ccRCC patients, helping identify those who may benefit from immunotherapy or targeted therapies. High MATH value correlates with worse survival and decreased immune response in ccRCC patients.",

However, cancer cells can acquire chemoresistance over multiple treatment cycles, leading to recurrence. This study aimed to investigate a novel biomarker for predicting ECF resistance and its biological roles in gastric cancer. ECF-resistant (ECF-R) gastric cancer cell lines were established through stepwise ECF treatment. Transcriptome analysis was performed to identify resistance-related genes, which were validated in tumor organoids and in vivo models. Additionally, gastric cancer patient tumor tissues were analyzed for clinical relevance. Transcriptome analysis revealed that NINJURIN2 and CD44 were highly expressed in ECF-R cells but rarely expressed in normal gastric tissues. NINJURIN2 inhibition significantly increased chemosensitivity to ECF in vitro and in vivo. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified periostin as a binding partner of NINJURIN2, mediating chemoresistance. Furthermore, VAV2 phosphorylation was markedly upregulated in ECF-R cells but was inhibited by NINJURIN2 knockdown. Clinical analysis showed that high NINJURIN2 expression correlated with poor survival outcomes in gastric cancer patients. Our findings suggest that NINJURIN2 can be used as a novel biomarker for chemoresistant gastric cancer patients and that inhibiting NINJURIN2 along with standard chemotherapy could prevent chemoresistance-associated relapse in gastric cancer.",

          "abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, necessitating the identification of novel biomarkers for improved prognosis and diagnosis. This study investigates the role of epoxide hydrolase 4 (<i>EPHX4</i>), a member of the epoxide hydrolase family, in LUAD. Using data sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases, which were subsequently validated by the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), we analyzed levels of <i>EPHX4</i> expression, mutation, and methylation in tumors versus normal tissues. Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of <i>EPHX4</i> in LUAD tissues compared to normal lung tissues (<i>p</i> < 0.001), correlating with poorer overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free interval (PFI). Furthermore, <i>EPHX4</i> exhibited considerable diagnostic potential, as demonstrated by an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.854 in a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Notably, <i>EPHX4</i> expression was associated with immune infiltration, specifically Th2 cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, along with immune checkpoint molecules including PD-L1, PD-L2, and TIM-3. Additionally, <i>EPHX4</i> was involved in pivotal tumor-associated pathways, particularly cell cycle regulation. In conclusion, an elevated <i>EPHX4</i> expression is indicative of poorer prognosis in LUAD and may play a role in immune evasion and cell cycle dysregulation, highlighting its potential as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and prognostic prediction of LUAD.",

          "abstract": "Genome instability is a major force driving tumorigenesis. The ssDNA-binding protein complex CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) plays a pivotal role in maintaining genome stability by countering replication stress, modulating DNA damage repair, and maintaining telomere integrity. Despite its well-documented role in genome maintenance, the involvement of CST in skin cancer development has yet to be investigated. We recently found that CST localizes at stalled DNA replication sites after UV exposure and may suppress the unwanted repriming activity, suggesting a potential role of CST in suppressing genome instability caused by UV damage. In this study, we first analyzed CST expression and alterations in cutaneous melanoma database and found that the CST genes are frequently altered in cutaneous melanoma and their expression is significantly downregulated in melanoma samples compared to normal tissues. We then generated a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model with STN1 deficiency specifically in melanocytes to investigate its role in skin cancer formation. Upon chronic exposure to UV irradiation, STN1-deficient mice exhibit no obvious difference in melanoma incidence compared to control littermates, suggesting that STN1 downregulation in mature melanocytes has no significant effect on UV-induced skin cancer development in lab mice.",

Using ribosome-profiling, we uncovered a selective translational response in acute hypoxia that is eIF3d/eIF3e-dependent and controls downstream hypoxic responses including HIF1a accumulation and cellular invasion. We further demonstrated that eIF3e copy number and an eIF3e-expression signature are associated with worsened outcomes for breast cancer patients. Finally, we identified a class of novel small molecules that target eIF3e specifically, reducing the translational response to hypoxia and to ER stress, another stressor that is dependent on eIF3d/eIF3e-mediated translation.

SCLC cells exhibit high plasticity and can progress from neuroendocrine (NE) to non-NE phenotypes. This dynamic evolution promotes treatment resistance and relapses, representing a challenge for targeted therapies in this elusive disease. Here we identify the transcription factor ONECUT2 (OC2) as a driver of plasticity in SCLC, leading to non-NE transcriptional states. OC2 is highly expressed in SCLC tumors compared to normal lung tissue and its expression is associated with heightened clinical stage and lymph node metastasis. We show that OC2 is a repressor of ASCL1, the NE master regulator transcription factor. In addition, OC2 upregulates non-NE programs through activation of c-MYC and Notch signaling. We also demonstrate that OC2 is required for growth and survival of SCLC cells and that it can be targeted with a small molecule inhibitor that acts synergistically with the standard combination of cisplatin and etoposide, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for OC2 active SCLC tumors.",

We identify HPV-associated SNSCC-specific recurrent mutations in KMT2C, UBXN11, AP3S1, MT-ND4, and MT-ND5, with KMT2D and FGFR3 mutations correlating with reduced overall survival. We establish an HPV-associated SNSCC cell line, showing that combinatorial small-molecule inhibition of YAP/TAZ and PI3K synergistically suppresses clonogenicity.

Neomorphic mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) promoting the production of R-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2HG) instead of \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG) are recurrent in human brain cancers and constitute an early event in low-grade gliomagenesis. Due to its structural similarity with \u03b1KG, R-2HG acts as an inhibitor of \u03b1KG-dependent enzymes. These include the JUMONJI family of lysine demethylases, among which KDM4A is particularly sensitive to R-2HG-mediated inhibition. However, the precise molecular mechanism through which inhibition of \u03b1KG-dependent enzymes by R-2HG promotes gliomagenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we show that treatment with R-2HG induces cellular senescence in a p53-dependent manner. Furthermore, expression of mutated IDH1R132H or exposure to R-2HG, which leads to KDM4A inhibition, causes telomeric dysfunction. We demonstrate that KDM4A localizes to telomeric repeats and regulates abundance of H3K9(me3) at telomeres. We show that R-2HG caused reduced replication fork progression, and that depletion of SMARCAL1, a helicase involved in replication fork reversal, rescues telomeric defects caused by R-2HG or KDM4A depletion. These results establish a model whereby IDH1/2 mutations cause R-2HG-mediated inhibition of KDM4A, leading to telomeric DNA replication defects, telomere dysfunction, and associated genomic instability.",

Resistance was linked to <i>ABCB1</i> upregulation, and inhibiting drug efflux sensitized eight resistant OCMs. MYC target genes were enriched in sensitive models, consistent with MYC being a potential driver of response. SUMO inhibition induced an adaptive transcriptional response in resistant cells, but this was attenuated in MYC-overexpressing cells, raising the possibility that transcriptional interference disrupts the homeostatic controls required to buffer the inhibition of SUMO signaling.

This study aims to investigate the therapeutic potential of MMP in GC and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. We screened marine compounds for their inhibitory activity against GC cells using cell viability, colony formation assays, cell cycle analysis, and apoptosis detection. RNA sequencing and KEGG enrichment analysis identified key downstream pathways activated by MMP. Western blotting, qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry confirmed changes in the p53 signaling pathway. Protein stability was assessed through turnover and ubiquitination assays, while Co-IP verified the effect of MMP on p53 binding to MDM2. An in vivo tumorigenesis study evaluated MMP's efficacy and safety in mice. MMP significantly inhibited GC cell proliferation and colony formation, induced apoptosis through the caspase pathway, and caused cell cycle G1 arrest by downregulating CDK4, CDK2 and upregulating p27. Mechanistically, MMP increased p53 protein levels and activated downstream targets (p21, PUMA, GADD45A) in a dose-dependent manner. It enhanced p53 stability by reducing ubiquitination. MMP injection in mice significantly inhibited tumor growth in a subcutaneous xenograft model. MMP displays anti-GC activity by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest via the p53 pathway.

Interpatient variability in tumor microenvironment composition and function poses ongoing challenges for personalized therapy selection, remaining a significant clinical problem. Serpin family E member 2 (SERPINE2) released from the tumor microenvironment exhibits significant regulatory functions in cancer progression but the role of SERPINE2 in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. In this study, we want to investigate the potential mechanism of SERPINE2 in tumor microenvironment of colon cancer. Bioinformatics analysis was used for exploring the mRNA expression level of SERPINE family in Pan-cancer, the prognostic significance of SERPINE family overexpression in four cancer types, the clinical relevance of SERPINE2 and the potential function of SERPINE2 in colorectal cancer. We conducted qRT-PCR, Western blot and ELISA to investigate the expression of SERPINE2. Additionally, Tissue chips, Transwell assays, Cell counting kit-8 assay, and co-culture system were used to evaluate the relationship between SERPINE2 and polarization of tumor-associated macrophages. Based on public database screening, the SERPINE family genes were significantly upregulated in various cancers, and high expression of SERPINE family genes in colorectal cancer was closely associated with poor prognosis. Compared to other family members, SERPINE2 showed a high expression level and was closely related to clinical malignant progression of colon cancer patients. co-expression network analysis, KEGG and GO analysis revealed that SERPINE2 expression correlates with tumor immunoregulation, division and proliferation. Immune infiltration analysis indicated a significant positive correlation between SERPINE2 and M2 macrophage infiltration, and tissue chip confirmed the correlation between SERPINE2 expression in colon cancer tissues and macrophage infiltration. Cell co-culture experiments further demonstrated that SERPINE2 secreted by colon cancer cells can induce polarization of M2 macrophages. Next, the recombinant protein SERPINE2 was observed to stimulate macrophage polarization. We found macrophages induced by SERPINE2 in co-culture with cancer cells accelerated cancer cell proliferation and migration. Our study demonstrates that tumor-secreted SERPINE2 mediates a positive feedback loop between tumor cells and M2 macrophages to accelerate cancer progression, suggesting SERPINE2 may be as a promising therapeutic target for colon cancer treatment.",

We develop MDmis, a method that uses biophysical features extracted from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of IDRs to predict pathogenicity. We find that pathogenic variants in Long IDRs manifest differently, with transient order and depleted solvent access, compared to those in Short IDRs. Using MD simulations of sequences with single missense variants, we identify stronger evidence for pathogenic effects in Long IDRs compared to Short IDRs. MDmis, when combined with conservation information, achieves strong predictive accuracy of pathogenicity of variants in Long IDRs.

Here, we report the results of a companion preclinical study in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models to evaluate how each tumor responded to each of the treatment regimens studied in the NCI-MPACT trial instead of simply to the specific regimen targeting the study-actionable mutation of interest (aMOI). Fifty-one PDX models (46 with and 5 without NCI-MPACT aMOIs) were tested against both the arm that would have been assigned in the NCI-MPACT trial as well as every other study regimen: (1) veliparib plus temozolomide or (2) adavosertib plus carboplatin (targeting the DNA repair pathway); (3) everolimus (targeting the PI3K pathway); and (4) trametinib (targeting the RAS/RAF/MEK pathway). Durability of response was measured by relative median time to tumor quadrupling event-free survival (EFSx4 \u2265 2), and duration of tumor regression. Eleven of 50 models (22%) treated with veliparib plus temozolomide responded according to one or both metrics, as did 2/47 models (4.2%) treated with adavosertib plus carboplatin, and 2/46 models (4.3%) treated with trametinib; no models responded to erlotinib. Follow-up studies demonstrated that temozolomide drove the activity of the veliparib plus temozolomide combination and drug sensitivity to temozolomide correlated with MGMT deficiency. This prospective preclinical study confirmed the modest response rates in the NCI-MPACT clinical trial. Substantial responses to temozolomide suggest that this drug represents an effective treatment for patients with MGMT deficiency, regardless of cancer type.",

Integrative analysis of transcriptomic data from 87,183 samples across 26 datasets reveals a progressive increase in Stemness and decline in pro-differentiation androgen receptor activity (AR-A) along the PCa continuum, with metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) exhibiting the highest Stemness and lowest AR-A. Both the general Stemness score and a newly developed 12-gene \"PCa-Stem Signature\" correlate with and predict poor clinical outcomes. Mechanistically, increased AR-A may promote Stemness in early-stage PCa while <i>MYC</i> amplification and bi-allelic <i>RB1</i> loss likely drive greatly elevated Stemness in mCRPC where AR-A is suppressed. Our findings establish Stemness as a robust quantitative measure of PCa aggressiveness and offer a scalable framework for PCa risk stratification.",

Rather, KDM4C loss causes proteolytic cleavage of histone H3 mediated by cathepsin L (CTSL), resulting in decreased glutamate-cysteine ligase expression and increased reactive oxygen species. CTSL is recruited to the chromatin by the grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) transcription factor that is methylated at lysine 453 following KDM4C inhibition, triggering CTSL histone clipping activity. Deletion of CTSL rescued KDM4-loss-mediated tumor suppression. Our study reveals a function for KDM4C that connects cellular redox regulation and chromatin remodeling.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether <i>RET</i> fusion positive (<i>RETfus+</i>) NSCLC represents a unique histologic subtype of the disease with a unique genomic profile. We selected 503 of 72,596 (0.7%) total NSCLC that were reported as <i>RETfus+</i> from the Foundation One database. The cases were centrally evaluated for predominant histology and underwent hybrid capture based CGP to evaluate diverse GA. Cases with <i>EGFR</i> mutations were excluded. PD-L1 expression was determined by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Dako 22C3) with Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) \u226550% = high expression. For statistical comparisons, the false discovery rate was corrected using Benjamini/Hochberg adjustment. Potentially targetable GAs found less frequently in the <i>RETfus+</i> group included <i>BRCA1, BRAF, FGF12, FGFR1, KEAP1, KMT2D, KRAS, MDM2, MET, NF1, NSD3, PIK3CA, RB1</i>, AND <i>TP53</i>. The presence of <i>HRD, APOBEC</i> and <i>Tobacco</i> gene signatures were also lower in frequencies in the <i>RETFus+</i> NSCLC cases. <i>SETD2</i> was the only GA found to be higher in the <i>RETfus+</i> group. While markers predictive of checkpoint therapy response including TMB high level was more frequent in the <i>RETfus-</i> cases, PD-L1 high expression was more in <i>RETfus+</i> samples. Surgical pathology analysis revealed that the high grade solid non-acinar pattern at 32% was the most frequent histologic subtype. <i>RETfus+</i> NSCLC features a unique genomic signature which can further impact therapy selection. With recent expanded approval of more specific RET kinase targeting inhibitors (selpercatinib and Pralsetinib) in the pan-cancer treatment setting, further study of <i>RETfusion+</i> NSCLC histology and genomic/biomarker status appears warranted.",

Plectin, a cytolinker and a critical component of the cell-ECM adhesion complex hemidesmosome (HD), plays an important role in the regulation of epithelial tissue mechanics, but its functions in carcinogenesis remain elusive. We used cellular and molecular methods and multiple systems, including a 2-dimensional (2-D) esophageal keratinocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent differentiation system, a 3-dimensional (3-D) esophageal keratinocyte organoid system, and tissue samples of normal rat and human esophageal stratified squamous epithelium (SSE), N-nitroso-N-methylbenzylamine (NMBzA)-induced rat esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and human ESCC, to determine the role(s) of plectin in regulating SSE homeostasis and ESCC carcinogenesis. We show that plectin is ubiquitously expressed in all proliferative and differentiative cell types in esophageal SSE. However, the localization of plectin in different cell types is controlled by plectin crosslinking to different macromolecular structures, such as HD, desmosome (DSM), and cytoskeletal filaments, and its expression is regulated by the ESCC oncogenic drivers and transcription factors, p63 and/or Notch1. Plectin functions by coupling plectin-associated HD, DSM, and cytoskeletal components together with plectin regulators p63 and Notch1, to maintain cell anchorage, proliferation/differentiation, and stratification of esophageal SSE tissue homeostasis. Perturbation of plectin expression and localization leads to the disruption of SSE homeostasis and the involvement in ESCC carcinogenesis. Plectin is involved in maintaining SSE homeostasis, and misexpression of plectin through its genetic alterations or transcriptional dysregulations perturbs the compositions, stoichiometries, and localizations of plectin, HD, DSM, and the cytoskeleton underlying the oncogenic characteristics of plectin.",

Our preclinical experiments and analyses of RNA sequencing data from clinical trials revealed nearly universal upregulation of BCL2 after ADT in CSPC cells. Mechanistically, our findings highlight a non-canonical function of BCL2 in orchestrating reciprocal signaling between the androgen receptor (AR)-BCL2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways, particularly upon ADT, potentially driving CSPC transformation into lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Critically, our results provide a scientific rational that BCL2 inhibition should be trialed in CSPC in combination with ADT to impede or delay ADT-induced CSPC-to-CRPC transformation but may be ineffective if tested in patients who already have CRPC.",

The methanol extract exhibited higher total phenol (81.57\u00a0mg/g) and total flavonoid (39.06\u00a0mg/g) contents compared to the aqueous extract. Antioxidant activity, assessed via the DPPH assay, showed moderate potency (IC\u2085\u2080: 330.77 \u00b5g/mL for aqueous- and 348.27 \u00b5g/mL for methanol extracts). Notably, the methanol extract demonstrated significant cytotoxicity against multiple cancer cell lines (IC\u2085\u2080: 27.73-53.90 \u00b5g/mL) particularly against A549, MDA-MB231, and PC3. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) profiling revealed abundant flavonoids and isoflavones such as daidzein, biochanin A, and 7,3'-dimethoxy-5,6,4' trihydroxyisoflavone in the methanol extract, correlating with its anticancer effects. In contrast, glycosylated flavonoids in the aqueous extract aligned with antioxidant activity. Cheminformatics clustering supported these findings, identifying distinct structural groups with differing drug-likeness scores. Bioinformatics analysis further identified transcriptomic signatures enriched in oxidative phosphorylation and key cancer-related pathways (e.g., TP53, PI3K, NRF2, and MYC), offering mechanistic insight.

Survival analysis revealed that increased <i>ELAVL1</i> expression was linked to unfavorable outcomes in certain cancers; however, its effect difers among various cancer types. Additionally, we found that the genomic alterations and modifications of <i>ELAVL1</i> were related to tumor progression. We discovered that <i>ELAVL1</i> was elevated in NPC tissues. In addition, survival analysis indicated that NPC patients with higher <i>ELAVL1</i> expression had worse prognoses. Functional assays demonstrated that <i>ELAVL1</i> suppression led to decreased proliferation and migration in NPC cell lines. Moreover, <i>ELAVL1</i> knockdown effectively inhibited NPC progression in the lymph node and lung metastasis models.

Here, the detailed crystal structure of the human BRCA2 C-terminal interaction domain (TR2 interface [TR2i]) complexed with ATP-bound RAD51 prior to DNA binding instead reveals TR2i unexpectedly induces a unique ATP-RAD51 dimer conformation that accommodates nucleation onto double-stranded B-DNA unsuited for HDR initiation.

MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are classified as type I or type II inhibitors, with the former binding to the DFG-in, active conformation of MET, and the latter to the DFG-out, inactive conformation of MET. Understanding how the different classes of MET TKIs impact tumours with varied MET alterations is critical to optimising treatment for patients with MET altered cancers. Here, we characterise MET mutations identified in patients' tumours and assess responsiveness to type I and II TKIs. We used structural modelling, in vitro kinase and in cell-based assays to assess the response of MET mutations to type I and II TKIs. We then translated our pre-clinical findings and treated patients with MET mutant tumours with selected inhibitors. We detected the emergence of four (three previously uncharacterised and one known) MET resistance mutations (MET<sup>G1090A</sup>, MET<sup>D1213H</sup>, MET<sup>R1227K</sup> and a MET<sup>Y1230S</sup>) in samples from patients with multiple solid tumours, including patients who had been previously treated with type I inhibitors. In silico modelling and biochemical assays across a variety of MET alterations, including the uncharacterised MET<sup>G1090A</sup> and the MET<sup>Y1230S</sup> substitutions, demonstrated impaired binding of type I but not of type II TKIs (i.e., cabozantinib/foretinib). Applying our pre-clinical findings, we then treated two patients (one with a non-small-cell lung cancer and one with a renal cell carcinoma) whose tumours harboured these previously uncharacterised MET alterations with cabozantinib, a type II MET TKI, and observed clinical responses. Comprehensive characterisation of the sensitivity of mutations to different TKI classes in oncogenic kinases may guide clinical intervention and overcome resistance to targeted therapies in selected cases. Kinase mutations in RTKs are primary or secondary drivers in multiple cancer types Some of these mutations confer resistance to type I but not to type II inhibitors in preclinical samples and in patients The biochemical characterization of mutations in oncogenic kinases based on their sensitivity to type I and type II inhibitors is crucial to inform clinical intervention.",

          "abstract": "Aberrant function or overactivation of exonuclease 1 (<i>EXO1</i>) may be associated with cancer tumor development, drug resistance, and response to immunotherapy in female-related cancers. By analyzing RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, combined with validation through quantitative polymerase chain reaction experiments, we explored the expression levels of <i>EXO1</i> in breast cancer (BRCA) cell lines and assessed its multidimensional roles in various female-related cancers. Our experiments revealed elevated expression of <i>EXO1</i> in BRCA cell lines, consistent with the RNA-sequencing data. The high expression of <i>EXO1</i> is associated with poor prognosis in various female-related cancers, especially in BRCA and UCEC. It significantly correlates with clinical and pathological characteristics. In specific cancer subtypes like the basal-like subtype of BRCA, high <i>EXO1</i> expression is associated with a better prognosis. Genetic mutation analysis indicates a higher frequency of <i>EXO1</i> gene mutations in uterine sarcoma and BRCA. DNA methylation levels may play a role in the regulation of <i>EXO1</i> gene expression in some cancers. <i>EXO1</i> expression is correlated with various factors within the tumor immune microenvironment and may be associated with the sensitivity to anticancer drugs. <i>EXO1</i> exhibits multidimensional roles in female-related cancers as a prognostic biomarker and potentially influences tumor immune therapy responses and drug sensitivities. Further studies are needed to fully understand the complex mechanisms underlying these associations and to explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting <i>EXO1</i>.",

          "abstract": "Alternative splicing enables a single precursor mRNA to generate multiple mRNA isoforms, leading to protein variants with different structures and functions. Abnormal alternative splicing is frequently associated with cancer development and progression. Recent studies have revealed a complex and dynamic interplay between epigenetic modifications and alternative splicing. On the one hand, dysregulated epigenetic changes can alter splicing patterns; on the other hand, splicing events can influence epigenetic landscapes. The reversibility of epigenetic modifications makes epigenetic drugs, both approved and investigational, attractive therapeutic options. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the bidirectional relationship between epigenetic regulation and alternative splicing in cancer. It also highlights emerging therapeutic approaches aimed at correcting splicing abnormalities, with a special focus on drug-based strategies. These include epigenetic inhibitors, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), small-molecule compounds, CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, and the SMaRT (splice-switching molecule) technology. By integrating recent advances in research and therapeutic strategies, this review provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of cancer and supports the development of more precise and effective therapies targeting aberrant splicing.",

          "abstract": "The oncogenic role of the G12 family in many human solid cancers has been extensively studied, primarily through the effects of constitutively active mutants of these proteins on cell migration and invasion. However, these mutations are not seen in cancers, and the biological role of G\u03b113 in prostate cancer tumorigenesis is largely unexplored. Here, we report that G\u03b113 promotes anchorage-independent colony formation, spheroid formation, and xenograft tumor growth in human prostate cancer cell lines. Transcriptome analyses suggest that G\u03b113 modulates genes in the mitochondria and are involved in the oxidative stress response. Silencing of <i>GNA13</i> increased mitochondrial superoxide levels when prostate cancer cells were cultured in galactose medium and increased the sensitivity to oxidative metabolic stress when the cells were cultured in media containing non-glycolytic metabolites. Furthermore, G\u03b113 levels impacts the abundance of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) in the mitochondria, as well as <i>SOD2</i> promoter activity and mRNA expression. Importantly, expression of SOD2 could rescue the effect of G\u03b113 loss on suppression of anchorage-independent growth. Likewise, stable knockdown of <i>SOD2</i> decreased anchorage-independent cell growth, which was enhanced by overexpression of G\u03b113. These results outline a novel biological function of G\u03b113 mediated via SOD2 in prostate cancer tumorigenesis and highlight it as a potential treatment target.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease with high metastasis potential, especially in the bones, liver, and lungs. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which emerge from active tumors, represent an early step toward metastasis and are associated with poor prognosis. CTCs of carcinoma origin are believed to express EpCAM and cytokeratins (CKs), common epithelial markers that are frequently used to identify them. However, in practice, the most aggressive CTCs lose the expression of those markers, leading to the partial loss of important information. Thus, finding some novel markers that identify CTCs regardless of their heterogeneity is crucial. A specific bioinformatics workflow integrating primary tumor and diverse BC cell lines transcriptomic expression analysis was developed and compared with single CTC transcriptomic analyses. We have identified a set of genes that are overexpressed in primary BC cells and are commonly upregulated among BC cell lines. Fifty of them were also found to be expressed in BC CTCs by single-cell transcriptomic analysis. Further in silico sorting narrowed this list to 12 genes. Using ScreenCell technology to isolate cancer cells spiked into normal blood, we tested the protein expression of all corresponding genes in vitro using the double immunocytochemistry method and validated MARCKSL1, SLC9A3R1, and RHOD as the most expressed markers. We then isolated the CTCs of 40 LN-invaded BC patients and 18 healthy donors using ScreenCell technology and showed that the combination of these three markers resulted in significantly better recognition of CTCs compared to EpCAM and CK conventional markers. Employing these novel markers, we found a clear distinction between blood samples from patients and healthy donors. In conclusion, through a specific bioinformatics workflow, in addition to in vitro and further clinical validations, we found three novel markers to precisely identify CTCs. These markers, when used together, enable a significantly more efficient identification of CTCs compared to conventional epithelial markers.",

This study aimed to investigate the roles of the potassium ion channel complex TWIK, a member of the two-pore-domain potassium channel subfamily, in clinical PCa. The clinicopathological, gene expression, and copy number data of three clinical PCa cohorts from cancer genomics databases were analysed to determine the clinicopathological, biological, and therapeutic significances of the TWIK expression signature using statistical correlations and gene enrichment techniques. The results show that the PCa subset with high TWIK expression exhibited associations with worse pathological tumours, nodes, and overall tumour stages, as well as with high Gleason scores, high prognostic grade groups, and poorer responses to androgen deprivation therapy. Furthermore, a combination of gene set and gene ontology enrichment analyses showed that the PCa subset with high TWIK complex expression was differentially enriched for known oncogenic signalling pathways, aberrant ubiquitination and glucuronidation activities, and for gene sets of ion channel blockers and chemotherapeutic agents. The implications of these findings with respect to cancer progression, therapeutic response, and opportunities for therapeutic targeting of the TWIK complex are discussed, along with the potential of the TWIK complex as a predictive biomarker for integrated, multitargeted therapy.",

Kynureninase (KYNU), a key enzyme in tryptophan catabolism, emerged as a top candidate. We then examined its relationship with LUAD mutations, metabolic alterations, immune microenvironment states, and expression patterns in human and mouse models using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, metabolomics, and preclinical model datasets. Pan-cancer prognostic associations were also assessed. <b>Results:</b> Model-based clustering of <i>KYNU</i> expression outperformed median-based dichotomization in prognostic accuracy. <i>KYNU</i> was elevated in tumors with <i>KEAP1</i> and <i>STK11</i> co-mutations but remained a strong independent prognostic marker. Metabolomic analysis showed that <i>KYNU</i>-high tumors had increased anthranilic acid, a catalytic product, while maintaining stable kynurenine levels, suggesting a compensatory mechanism sustaining immunosuppressive signaling. Single-cell and bulk data showed <i>KYNU</i> expression was cancer cell-intrinsic in immune-cold tumors and myeloid-derived in immune-infiltrated tumors. In murine LUAD models, <i>Kynu</i> expression was predominantly immune-derived and uncoupled from Nrf2/Lkb1 signaling, indicating poor model fidelity. <i>KYNU</i>'s prognostic associations extended across cancer types, with poor outcomes in pancreatic and kidney cancers but favorable outcomes in melanoma, underscoring the need for lineage-specific considerations in therapy development. <b>Conclusions:</b><i>KYNU</i> is a robust prognostic biomarker and potential immunometabolic target in LUAD, especially in <i>STK11</i> and <i>KEAP1</i> co-mutated tumors.

This review comprehensively explores the diverse functions of TRIM proteins in gliomas, including their expression patterns, prognostic significance, and mechanisms of action that are both ubiquitination-dependent and -independent.

In this study, we analyzed the TCGA mRNA-seq dataset to assess the expression levels of fibronectin (FN1) and associated integrin subunits, evaluating their relationship with clinical features in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). These findings were further validated in a cell model. FN1 mRNA levels in BRAFV600E-positive PTC were 80-fold compared to normal thyroid tissue (NT), whereas PTC with RAS mutations exhibited FN1 levels similar to NT. ITGAV, encoding the \u03b1v integrin subunit, which pairs with \u03b23 to form a receptor for FN, was also overexpressed in PTC. Elevated FN1 expression, and to a lesser extent ITGAV, correlated positively with lymph node metastasis, advanced cancer stages, extrathyroidal extension, and poorer prognoses. Patients in the highest quartile of FN1 expression had an increased risk of disease recurrence (OR = 7.277, 95% CI: 2.019-26.191, P < 0.0024). A non-tumoral thyroid cell line and two PTC cell lines were used as models to validate the mRNA-seq results. The proliferation and migration of a FN1 knock-out PTC cell mutant were significantly reduced and proliferation was restored upon the addition of soluble FN. DisBa-01, a recombinant RGD-disintegrin derived from Bothrops alternatus snake venom, which acts as an antagonist to the FN/\u03b1v\u03b23 interaction, inhibited PTC cell proliferation and migration. These results demonstrate that FN expression is a hallmark of aggressiveness in PTC. FN/\u03b1v\u03b23 interaction plays a pivotal role in PTC, suggesting that the FN/\u03b1v\u03b23 signaling is a potential therapeutic target for disintegrins or other molecules with similar action.",

This malignant tumor originating from adipose tissue is classified into different subtypes with specific molecular markers, which not only distinguish them but also guide treatment directions. The main approach for treating liposarcoma is surgical resection, with the aim of complete excision and achieving clean margins (R0 resection) to minimize the risk of recurrence. This surgical principle emphasizes the critical need for precise preoperative planning, and in certain cases, the integration of neoadjuvant therapy may be needed to reduce the tumor to a surgically manageable size. In addition to surgery, systemic therapy plays a key role in the advanced stages of the disease, especially when resistance to traditional treatment arises. The emergence of novel systemic therapies, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, has opened new avenues for treating this challenging malignancy. These systemic therapies are selected on the basis of the specific molecular features of the tumor, highlighting the importance of detailed molecular diagnostics. As our understanding of the molecular basis of liposarcoma deepens, integrating clinical and molecular features is crucial for optimizing treatment outcomes. This comprehensive approach, which combines surgical precision with systemic therapy innovations, will change the treatment landscape for patients with liposarcoma, advancing toward more personalized and effective treatment strategies.",

Subsequent analyses in experimental models demonstrates that FOXA2 induces a fetal neuroendocrine gene expression program and promotes multi-site metastasis. Moreover, we identify ASCL1, a transcription factor known for its initiating role in SCLC tumorigenesis, as a direct binder of the FOXA2 promoter and regulator of FOXA2 expression.

          "abstract": "Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) is a prevalent and aggressive cancer, often diagnosed at later stages, which poses challenges for effective treatment. Despite advancements in cancer therapies, the phenomenon of tumor drug resistance remains a critical hurdle. Recent studies have highlighted cuproptosis, a copper-dependent regulated cell death process, as a potential mechanism in various cancers, including STAD. This study integrates cuproptosis-related gene signatures with clinical features to better predict prognosis and explore potential therapeutic targets, focusing on the role of cuproptosis in overcoming tumor resistance mechanisms. Using comprehensive datasets from TCGA-STAD (n\u2009=\u2009375 tumor samples, 32 normal samples), GTEx (n\u2009=\u2009211 normal gastric tissues), and GEO (GSE84437 and GSE29272), we analyzed the expression of genes associated with cuproptosis. We examined genetic alterations, immune infiltration, and constructed multivariate Cox regression models with clinicopathological covariates (age, gender, TNM stage, histological grade, residual tumor status) to assess the relationship between cuproptosis gene expression and patient survival outcomes, including overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free interval (PFI). Drug sensitivity analysis was performed using the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. Our analysis identified significant upregulation of several cuproptosis-related genes, including FDX1, which was correlated with improved prognosis and immune cell infiltration patterns. High expression of FDX1 was associated with better OS and DSS outcomes. Further genetic alterations, notably in CDKN2A, were frequent and linked to poor prognosis, highlighting the complexity of tumor drug resistance in STAD. Prognostic models incorporating FDX1, PDHA1, and LIAS expression stratified patients into distinct risk categories, emphasizing their potential as biomarkers for personalized therapeutic strategies. This study underscores the importance of cuproptosis-related genes, particularly FDX1, in the prognosis and therapeutic response of STAD. By integrating molecular features with clinical data, we offer insights into the potential for overcoming drug resistance in cancer therapy. These findings lay the groundwork for future research into targeted treatments that modulate cuproptosis, offering a novel approach to tackling tumor progression and resistance in STAD.",

          "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks among the most common and deadliest cancers worldwide. Previous studies have found that the molecular motor Mysoin 5b (MYO5B) is decreased at the level of mRNA in CRC, but the mechanism behind this reduction remains unknown. In normal cells, MYO5B function is contingent on proper folding by the chaperone protein unc-45 myosin chaperone A (UNC45A). However, little is known about the role of UNC45A in CRC. We examined RNA, methylation, and protein levels of MYO5B and UNC45A and identified microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting UNC45A in normal colon, colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) samples, cancer cell lines, and human colonic organoids. Cells were treated with the DNA-demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine to examine the role of methylation in regulating MYO5B levels. Additionally, the UNC45A targeting miR-296-3p was inhibited in cells, and UNC45A levels were examined. Consistent with previous reports, we found that MYO5B mRNA was reduced in COAD compared with controls. We observed that the MYO5B gene was hyper-methylated in COAD and treatment of cancer cells with a demethylating compound increased MYO5B expression, suggesting that methylation silences MYO5B in COAD. The MYO5B folding chaperone UNC45A was not changed at the mRNA level but was decreased at the protein level. We identified several UNC45A targeting miRNAs that were elevated in COAD patients. We confirmed that these miRNAs were elevated in colon cancer cell lines compared with normal colonic organoids and found that inhibition of one of these miRNAs increased UNC45A protein. These findings suggest that decreased levels of MYO5B in COAD may result from gene methylation and improper folding by UNC45A.",

GSEA and ssGSEA were used to explore the involved biological pathways and the degree of immune cell infiltration, respectively. The prognosis model was constructed by lasso-COX.

ARID1A mutations were correlated with an improved prognosis in individuals treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) analyzed via Cbioportal website. TCGA-STAD cohort was randomly divided into a training-group and a testing-group. Additionally, ARM was developed in the training group, which identified APOD and PROC from ARID1A mutation-associated differential immunity genes. A significantly poorer prognosis in the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group, which was consistent across TCGA-training/testing/all cohorts, five GEO cohorts and 55 GC patients from Hainan General Hospital. Furthermore, the immune microenvironment components and ICI therapeutic efficacy markers were different between the two groups. Meanwhile, APOD and PROC expression was higher in GC tissues compared to para-cancerous tissues. Baicalin and capsaicin inhibited the proliferation and metastatic ability of GC cells. ARM provides valuable insights into the prognosis and the effectiveness of ICI, thereby offering a novel strategy for clinical decision. Baicalin and capsaicin are promising potential drugs for GC treatment.",

Immunohistochemical staining of bladder cancer and adjacent tissues assessed RAP1GAP expression and clinical correlations. RAP1GAP expression is differentially expressed in a variety of tumor types and predicts a better or worse prognosis for tumor patients.

In addition, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Ak strain transforming (AKT) pathway is frequently altered and represents a promising therapeutic target for BC. Understanding the combined prognostic impact of <i>TP53</i>mut and PI3K/AKT pathway alterations across BC subtypes remains underexplored. This retrospective cohort study integrated clinical and genomic data from 4,265 patients with BC from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (n = 2,509) and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (n = 1,756). Genetic profiling identified <i>TP53</i>mut and PI3K/AKT pathway alterations (<i>AKT1</i>, <i>AKT2</i>, <i>AKT3</i>, <i>PIK3CA</i>, <i>PTEN</i>, <i>RICTOR</i>). Survival outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. In 3,807 patients with available gene alteration status, <i>TP53</i>mut was associated with younger age, higher tumor grade, advanced stage, and aggressive subtypes (<i>P</i> < .001). <i>TP53</i>mut was associated with worse survival independent of subtype, stage, age, and grade (hazard ratio [HR], 1.43 [95% CI, 1.24 to 1.66]; <i>P</i> < .0001). The type of <i>TP53</i>mut has also been found to be prognostic in BC. PI3K/AKT pathway alterations were more frequent in <i>TP53</i>mut tumors and independently associated with worse survival (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.35]; <i>P</i> = .0173). The combined presence of <i>TP53</i>mut and PI3K/AKT alterations resulted in the worst survival outcomes (HR, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.32 to 1.97]; <i>P</i> < .0001). <i>TP53</i>mut status is a critical prognostic factor in BC, independent of subtypes and stage, and its adverse impact is amplified by PI3K/AKT pathway alterations. These findings emphasize the integration of genetic profiling into routine clinical practice to refine treatment strategies and identify potential therapeutic targets for this high-risk population.",

MGMT is irreversibly inhibited by O<sup>6</sup>-benzylguanine (O6BG), while the Pro140Lys (P140K) variant is resistant. Combining the use of O6BG/BCNU with gene transfer of MGMT P140K into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has enabled in vivo enrichment of gene-modified HSCs for therapeutic effect in preclinical studies. However, the P140K substitution cannot reliably be made using currently available gene-editing approaches. Identifying functional MGMT variants that are resistant to inhibitors and amenable to gene editing would enable in vivo enrichment of HSCs edited at both MGMT and a therapeutic locus. We used computational analyses to select putative variants and generated a library of MGMT variant-expressing plasmids (pMGMTs). For our functional screen, we treated MGMT-deficient U251 cells with O6BG and co-transfected them with pMGMT together with a plasmid cocktail including a fluorescent host cell reactivation reporter plasmid (mPlum_O<sup>6</sup>MeG) for MGMT activity. Flow cytometric analysis of MGMT activity identified active and O6BG-resistant MGMT variants. Treatment with a second MGMT inhibitor, PaTrin-2, confirmed these results. We also found MGMT variants that are detectable in the general population and tumors to be active and O6BG sensitive. Taken together, our findings establish a functional database for MGMT variants and a cell-based platform for screening DNA-repair proteins for unknown functional properties.",

Thyroid hormones, critical regulators of metabolism and cell growth, have been implicated in tumorigenesis, yet their specific role in prostate cancer risk remains unclear. This study systematically investigates the relationship between thyroid hormones and prostate cancer using multidimensional approaches. A three-phase study design was employed: (1) A cross-sectional analysis of The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to examine thyroid hormone levels (FT3 and T3) and prostate cancer risk; (2) Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data to explore causal relationships; (3) Bioinformatics analyses to annotate key Single Nucleotide Polymorphism(SNPs), identify related genes, and assess their biological roles in prostate cancer. Observational analysis revealed significantly lower FT3 and T3 levels in high-risk prostate cancer patients, with adjusted models confirming an inverse association (p\u2009<\u20090.001). MR analysis supported a causal relationship between thyroid hormone replacement therapy and reduced prostate cancer risk (b\u2009<\u20090, p\u2009<\u20090.05).

This study aims to investigate the cellular composition of the TME in LUAD and assess the role of the MDK-NCL signaling pathway. We employed a multi-omics strategy to investigate LUAD, combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics (ST), and bulk RNA-seq datasets. Publicly available scRNA-seq data and ST data were utilized. scRNA-seq data underwent quality control, dimensionality reduction, and clustering to characterize cell populations and identify malignant epithelial subtypes using the Seurat and inferCNV packages. Spatial transcriptomics data facilitated the identification of distinct tumor niches, while immune infiltration and ligand-receptor interactions were analyzed using MCPcounter and Niches. Experimental validation was performed via real-time PCR and western blotting on paired LUAD and adjacent normal tissue samples. scRNA-seq revealed the presence of multiple immune and stromal cell populations, with malignant epithelial cells being subdivided into six clusters. The MDK-NCL axis demonstrated high activity in malignant cells, showing strong interactions with immune and stromal components. Spatial transcriptomics revealed nine distinct tumor niches, with MDK-NCL signaling notably upregulated at the tumor-immune interface, highlighting its role in establishing an immunosuppressive microenvironment. In both the TCGA-LUAD cohort and in-house cohort, MDK and NCL were significantly upregulated at the mRNA and protein levels in tumor samples compared to normal tissues. High MDK-NCL expression in the TCGA-LUAD cohort correlated with increased TMB, MSI, and reduced immune cell infiltration. Elevated levels of immune checkpoint genes, including PD-1 and CTLA-4, in patients with high MDK-NCL expression suggested a potential resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Moreover, patients with high MDK-NCL expression exhibited poorer survival outcomes, underscoring the pathway's role in tumor progression and immune evasion. Our findings reveal that LUAD cells use the MDK-NCL signaling pathway to shape the TME, suppressing immune activity and promoting malignancy in epithelial cells. This study highlights the MDK-NCL axis as a potential therapeutic target for LUAD, particularly for patients with high MDK-NCL expression.",

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence experiments were used to analyze the expression of RBFOX1 protein in colorectal cancer cells and tissues.ResultsRBFOX1 has a high frequency (22.4%) of copy number loss and diverse copy number variations in colorectal cancer tissues. High-level RBFOX1 deletion is prone to occur in the right-sided colon and tissues with high microsatellite instability. The copy number variation of RBFOX1 and mRNA expression are not correlated.

Despite therapeutic advances, a critical unmet need persists for identifying novel therapeutic targets. Our integrated bioinformatics analysis identified DTL, a component of the Cullin-RING ligase (CRL) E3 ubiquitin ligase family, as significantly upregulated in BC tissues. This upregulation correlated with poor patient prognosis, cancer stemness, and metabolic reprogramming, which was driven by genetic alterations such as gene amplification and reduced promoter methylation. Functional studies demonstrated that DTL promoted breast cancer cell proliferation and migration <i>in vitro</i> through glycolysis remodeling. Mechanistically, DTL positively regulated key glycolytic enzymes (HK2, ENO1, PKM2, and LDHA) independently of its canonical ubiquitin ligase activity and directly interacted with LDHA. Notably, exogenous L-lactate directly enhanced BC tumor growth and metastasis. Collectively, our findings reveal a non-canonical mechanism whereby DTL drives glycolysis to generate the oncometabolite L-lactate, which directly sustains breast cancer malignancy independent of protein degradation.

          "abstract": "An unmet clinical need requires the discovery of new treatments for men facing advanced prostate cancer. Aberrant glycosylation is a universal feature of cancer cells and plays a key role in tumour growth, immune evasion and metastasis. Alterations in tumour glycosylation are closely associated with prostate cancer progression, making glycans promising therapeutic targets. Fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8) drives core fucosylation by adding \u03b11,6-fucose to the innermost GlcNAc residue on N-glycans. While FUT8 is recognised as a crucial factor in cancer progression, its role in prostate cancer remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate using multiple independent clinical cohorts that FUT8 is upregulated in high grade and metastatic prostate tumours, and in the blood of prostate cancer patients with aggressive disease. Using novel tools, including PhosL lectin immunofluorescence and N-glycan MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), we find FUT8 underpins the biosynthesis of malignant core fucosylated N-glycans in prostate cancer cells and using both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo models, we find FUT8 promotes prostate tumour growth, cell motility and invasion. Mechanistically we show FUT8 regulates the expression of genes and signalling pathways linked to prostate cancer progression. Furthermore, we find that fucosylation inhibitors can inhibit the activity of FUT8 in prostate cancer to suppress the growth of prostate tumours. Our study cements FUT8-mediated core fucosylation as an important driver of prostate cancer progression and suggests targeting FUT8 activity for prostate cancer therapy as an exciting area to explore.",

We performed a comprehensive analysis using datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTE x), UALCAN, Star Base, and Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), and observed significant dysregulation of LRFN4 in multiple cancers compared to normal tissues. LRFN4 expression was strongly correlated with clinical prognosis, immune subtypes, molecular subtypes, immune checkpoint (ICP) genes, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and immune infiltration, which were measured by ESTIMATE scores. Moreover, LRFN4 expression was associated with the presence of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, particularly in gastrointestinal tumors, reflecting immune cell genetic signatures. Validation through fluorescence multiplex immunohistochemistry confirmed that the association of LRFN4 protein expression with the clinicopathological features and the immune microenvironment of gastric cancer. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that LRFN4 inhibited apoptosis in gastric cancer cell lines while enhancing cell cycle arrest in the S phase. Western Blot analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between the high expression of LRFN4 and the expression levels of cyclin D1 as well as CDK4. In contrast, a negative correlation was observed between the high expression of LRFN4 and the expression level with cleaved-caspase-3 levels. These findings suggest that LRFN4 may serve as a novel biomarker for cancer prognosis and a potential target for immunotherapy.",

Tryptophan metabolism plays a pivotal role in tumor progression and immune modulation. This study aimed to develop and validate a tryptophan metabolism-related risk model and molecular subtypes to predict BCR in PCa patients after RP. The Cancer Genome Atlas-Prostate Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) dataset, including 421 PCa patients, was analyzed to identify key tryptophan metabolism-related genes (TMRGs) using differential expression, univariate Cox, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analyses. The tryptophan metabolism-related risk model was constructed through multivariate Cox regression, and tryptophan metabolism-related molecular subtypes were established using consensus clustering. External validation was conducted using an independent dataset, while immunohistochemistry (IHC) and single-cell sequencing further confirmed TMRG expression patterns and their roles in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The tryptophan metabolism-related risk model and molecular subtypes effectively stratified PCa patients into low- and high-risk groups or two molecular subtypes. High-risk PCa patients (n=211) and those in Cluster 1 (n=261) exhibited significantly poorer biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) and distinct clinicopathological features, immune infiltration profiles, and TME characteristics. External validation confirmed the robustness of the tryptophan metabolism-related risk model and molecular subtypes. IHC and single-cell sequencing highlighted the expression patterns of TMRGs and their regulatory roles in the TME. This study established and validated tryptophan metabolism-related risk scores and molecular subtypes as reliable predictors of BCR in PCa patients after RP.

The MEX3 family genes has been implicated in various cancers; however, their roles in HCC remain largely unexplored. This study aims to systematically analyze the expression patterns, prognostic significance, and immune-related functions of MEX3A, MEX3B, MEX3C, and MEX3D in HCC using comprehensive bioinformatics approaches. We conducted a multi-level bioinformatics analysis to investigate the expression, prognostic significance, clinicopathological correlations, genetic alterations, immune associations, and functional mechanisms of MEX3 family members in HCC. Transcriptomic data from TCGA and GEO databases, along with experimental validation via qRT-PCR and Western blotting, were used to assess expression profiles. Kaplan-Meier, ROC curve, and Cox regression analyses were employed for prognostic evaluation. Co-expression, enrichment, and immune infiltration analyses further elucidated the functional and immunological relevance of MEX3 family genes. A prognostic model based on co-expressed genes was constructed and validated using LASSO and time-dependent ROC analyses. MEX3A, MEX3B, MEX3C, and MEX3D were significantly upregulated in HCC tissues compared to normal liver tissues (P\u2009<\u20090.05). ROC curve analysis demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, particularly for MEX3A (AUC\u2009=\u20090.915). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that elevated MEX3A and MEX3C expression was associated with poorer overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Mutation analysis revealed that MEX3A exhibited the highest alteration frequency (11%), primarily through gene amplifications. Immune infiltration analysis demonstrated significant correlations between MEX3 expression and multiple immune cell populations, including regulatory T cells (Tregs), cytotoxic T cells, and macrophages. Moreover, MEX3B, MEX3C, and MEX3D expression correlated with key immune checkpoint genes, including PDCD1, CD274, and CTLA4. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that MEX3 co-expressed genes were significantly involved in RNA metabolism, immune response regulation, and oncogenic signaling pathways. A 17-gene MEX3 co-expression-based prognostic model stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups with significantly different survival outcomes (AUC\u2009=\u20090.791 at 1 year). This study highlights the oncogenic potential of MEX3 family members in HCC and their associations with immune regulation. The findings suggest that MEX3 family genes could serve as potential biomarkers for HCC prognosis and immunotherapy responsiveness. Further experimental validation is warranted to elucidate the mechanistic roles of MEX3 family genes in HCC progression and immune evasion.",

Reporting of these mutations without additional clarification may result in poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy, where there is not likely true benefit. The purpose of this work was to identify <i>BRCA1</i>/<i>2</i> passenger mutation hotspots that are secondary to MSI-H status rather than truly independent driving mutations. We analyzed over 100,000 pancancer patient cases in cBioPortal with both <i>BRCA1</i>/<i>2</i> mutations and MSI-H status to identify passenger mutation hotspots that recur in microsatellite sites. We validated these hotspots as likely reflective of MSI-H status using a data set of nearly 20,000 patient cases from the University of Washington. We identified six recurrent frameshift passenger mutation hotspots in <i>BRCA1</i> (K339fs and K654fs) and <i>BRCA2</i> (I605fs, W1692fs, N1784fs, and T3033fs). These hotspots represented 17% and 21% of all truncating <i>BRCA1</i>/<i>2</i> mutations detected in the cBioPortal and University of Washington data sets, respectively, and were seen almost exclusively in MSI-H tumors. These hotspots had a mean variant allele fraction of 17%, supporting their occurrence as passenger mutations. All hotspots are annotated in ClinVar as pathogenic variants, and all but one in catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer as somatic hotspots. Current annotations do not mention MSI. Our findings emphasize the need for molecular pathology laboratories and clinical variant databases to annotate <i>BRCA1</i>/<i>2</i> passenger mutation hotspots with more context to interpret their pathogenicity in the setting of concurrent MSI. Identification and annotation of such hotspots will improve how oncology providers guide patients regarding therapeutic options.",

The genomic analysis resulted in diagnostic refinement or reassignment for 20% of the cases. Somatic mutations were predominantly enriched in the RTK/RAS pathway, accounting for 64.7% of the findings. Additionally, actionable mutations were identified in 70.6% of patients who had a confirmed diagnosis of MPNST. Notably, the study revealed the presence of altered genes that were absent in Western populations, suggesting potential ethnic differences and the opportunity for alternative treatment strategies. Furthermore, patients with CDKN2A mutations exhibited significantly shorter disease-free survival compared to those without such mutations, with median survival times of 6.08\u00a0months versus 14.3\u00a0months (p\u2009=\u20090.0038).

Patients with a high TBL show a higher risk of recurrence and shorter median survival times for 5/15 cancer types.

Clinical and transcriptomic data from 163 GBM and 518 lower-grade glioma (LGG) cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed to assess LSM2 expression and its prognostic value. RNA sequencing was performed on LSM2 knockdown in T98G glioblastoma cells to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and alternative splicing events (ASEs). Bioinformatics tools were employed to perform functional enrichment analyses and construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. LSM2 expression was significantly elevated in gliomas, particularly in GBM and in tumours with 1p/19q non-deletion or IDH1 mutation (p < 0.001). High LSM2 expression was correlated with shorter overall survival (HR = 1.7, p = 0.01). Knockdown of LSM2 in T98G cells identified 728 upregulated and 1,720 downregulated genes, alongside 1,949 splicing alterations, which primarily affected pathways related to RNA metabolism, DNA damage response, and cell cycle regulation. Key hub genes such as TLN1, FN1, and IRF7 were associated with glioma progression and poor prognosis.

The P2Y2 receptor, an ATP-activated purinergic receptor, is typically associated with pulmonary, endothelial, and neurological cell signaling. Here, we examine ATP-dependent signaling in breast epithelial cells and how it is altered in metastatic breast cancer. Using rapid imaging techniques, we show how ATP-activated P2Y2 signaling causes an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells, approximately 3-fold higher than their tumorigenic and metastatic counterparts. The non-tumorigenic cells respond to increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> with actin polymerization and localization to the cell edges after phalloidin staining, while the metastatic cells remain unaffected. The increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> after ATP stimulation was blunted to control levels using a P2Y2 antagonist, which also prevented actin mobilization and significantly increased cell dissemination from spheroids in non-tumorigenic cells. Furthermore, the lack of Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes and actin mobilization in metastatic breast cancer cells could be due to the reduced P2Y2 expression, which correlates with poorer overall survival in breast cancer patients. This study elucidates the rapid changes that occur after elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in breast epithelial cells and how metastatic cancer cells have adapted to evade this cellular response.",

The tight junction protein claudin-1, known to influence cellular functions in various cancers and is considered a therapeutic target, remains unclear in pancreatic cancer. This study assessed claudin-1 expression in resected pancreatic cancer samples, public databases, and pancreatic cancer cell lines. <i>Claudin-1</i> knockout with CRISPR/Cas9 on poorly differentiated pancreatic cancer cell lines and a proteome analysis were performed to investigate the intracellular mechanisms of claudin-1. Claudin-1 was markedly overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and intraepithelial neoplasia compared to normal ducts, and high claudin-1 levels were an independent predictor of poor prognosis. <i>Claudin-1</i> knockout diminished cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and chemoresistance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Proteome analysis revealed the significant downregulation of aldo-keto reductase family proteins (AKR1C2, AKR1C3, and AKR1B1) in <i>claudin-1</i> knockout cells, which are linked to metabolic pathways. Aldo-keto reductase knockdown reduced chemoresistance, proliferation, and invasion in these cell lines. These findings indicate that the abnormal expression of claudin-1 promotes tumor progression and drug resistance through its interaction with aldo-keto reductase proteins, highlighting claudin-1 and aldo-keto reductase family proteins as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer.",

SUMO-specific peptidases, known as SENPs, emerge as critical players, regulating tumorigenesis and progression of numerous cancer types. Despite this, the specific impact of SENPs in HCC remains unclear. Hence, our study aimed to reveal the immune and prognostic implications of SENPs in HCC. The gene expression of SENP\u00a0in various cancers was examined using open-access databases including TCGA, GTEx, and CPTAC. In order to investigate the prognostic potential of the SENP family, Kaplan-Meier analysis was used. To clarify the underlying biological mechanisms, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was carried out. cBioPortal database was used to evaluate genetic mutation profiles. For insight into the relationship between SENP genes and tumor immunity, various algorithms were used. Our findings showed that SENP1, SENP2, SENP3, SENP5, SENP6, and SENP7 expression levels were significantly higher in HCC tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. In HCC patients, elevated SENP1 and SENP5 expression has been associated with tumor development and poor outcomes. Our immune infiltration patterns results also showed significant correlations between SENP5 expression and neutrophil (cor\u2009=\u20090.346, p\u2009<\u20090.001), myeloid dendritic cell (cor\u2009=\u20090.491, p\u2009<\u20090.001), macrophage (cor\u2009=\u20090.465, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and memory B cell (cor\u2009=\u20090.336, p\u2009<\u20090.001) infiltration in HCC, whereas SENP1 expression was associated with none of these infiltrations. The prognostic and immunogenetic value of SENP1 and SENP5 in HCC was demonstrated in this study. Therefore, these two genes have the potential to function as separate prognostic biomarkers and offer promise as immunotherapeutic targets in the fight against HCC.",

Despite its clinical utility as a companion diagnostic for ICI across cancers, a high TMB does not consistently predict response due to technical and biological limitations. Tumor heterogeneity and purity, blood versus tissue sampling, variation in next-generation sequencing, and algorithmic evaluation attenuate the predictive value of TMB. In addition to technical standardization and moving beyond TMB as a numeric or binarized value, it is of paramount importance to consider the underlying biology and the differential contribution of mutation subsets to tumor foreignness and immunogenicity. The importance of consideration of mutations within the overall TMB that are unlikely to be immunoedited together with the density of immunogenic \"quality\" mutation-associated neoantigens introduces the concept of biological calibration of TMB that may enhance its clinical utility. Mutagenic processes such as microsatellite instability and ultra-mutation and cancer lineage-dependent co-mutation patterns also represent biological modifiers that enable the interpretation of the overall TMB in different contexts. In this perspective, we dissect TMB on a biological and technical level, followed by a critical assessment of the predictive role of TMB in capturing ICI response in the setting of clinical trials across human cancers. The standardization of technical methodologies, together with the interpretation of TMB on the basis of the tumor genomic landscape, represents key steps toward maximizing the predictive value of TMB for cancer immunotherapy.",

Concomitant loss of functional p53 and ARF leads to massive gains in cell proliferation and transformation and is often observed in some of the most aggressive human cancer subtypes. These phenotypic gains are preceded by increased type I interferon (IFN) signaling that involves canonical STAT1 activation and a subsequent IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) signature. Here, we show that cells lacking p53 and ARF require active JAK1 to phosphorylate STAT1 on Y701 to maintain their high rate of proliferation. In fact, the use of selective JAK1 inhibitors ruxolitinib or baricitinib inhibited the induction of ISG's and the proliferation of p53 and ARF deleted cells. We identify a group of solid human tumors that lack functional p53 and ARF, show an expression signature of the upregulated type I IFN response genes, and are sensitive to selective JAK1 inhibitors. These data suggest that the type I IFN response acts as a positive driver of proliferation in the absence of p53 and ARF and, as such, presents itself as a potential therapeutic target in aggressive solid tumors.",

When ribosomal capacity is limited by actinomycin D treatment, anaplastic Wilms tumor cells preferentially translate proteasome components. Next, we find that the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib sensitizes cells to actinomycin D treatment in vitro and prolongs survival in xenograft models. Lastly, increased levels of proteasome components are associated with anaplastic histology and worse prognosis in Wilms tumor patients.

          "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) or cytotoxic T-lymphocytes-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) reinvigorate strong polyclonal T-cell immune responses against tumor cells. For many patients, these therapies fail because the development of spontaneous immune responses is often compromised, as the tumor microenvironment (TME) lacks proinflammatory signals resulting in suboptimal activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Necroptosis is a special form of programmed cell death associated with leakage of inflammatory factors that can lead to APC maturation. However, it is unclear to which extent functional necroptosis in tumor cells contributes to ICI immunotherapy. With genetically engineered tumor cell lines that lack specific components of the necroptosis machinery (mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL), receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)), we addressed the importance of necroptotic tumor cell death for the efficacy of ICI immunotherapy in murine models. Preclinical data were aligned with genome-wide transcriptional programs in patient tumor samples at diagnosis and during ICI treatment for the activity of these pathways and association with treatment outcome. Mice bearing MLKL-deficient or RIPK3-deficient tumors failed to control tumor growth in response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy. Mechanistically, defects in the necroptosis pathway resulted in reduced tumor antigen cross-presentation by type 1 conventional dendritic cells (DCs) in tumor-draining lymph nodes, and subsequently impaired immunotherapy-induced expansion of circulating tumor antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and their accumulation and activation in the TME. In vitro, co-culture of tumor cells undergoing necroptotic but not apoptotic programmed cell death resulted in increased uptake by phagocytic cells, associated with maturation and activation of DCs. Treatment of tumors with the epigenetic modulator azacytidine enhanced intrinsic transcriptional activity of the necroptosis machinery, and hence their susceptibility to ICI immunotherapy. In humans, transcriptome analysis of melanoma samples revealed a strong association between high expression of <i>MLKL</i> and prolonged overall survival and durable clinical response to immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitors. Defective necroptosis signaling in tumor cells is a cancer resistance mechanism to ICI immunotherapy. Reversion of epigenetic silencing of the necroptosis pathway can render tumors susceptible to checkpoint inhibition.",

While the TNFAIP8 gene family (TNFAIP8, TNFAIP8L1, TNFAIP8L2, and TNFAIP8L3) is implicated in cancer and immune regulation, its role in AML remains unclear. This study utilized bioinformatics analyses to investigate their expression, prognostic significance, genetic alterations, and immune associations in AML. The expression levels and clinical significance of TNFAIP8 family genes in AML were evaluated using UCSC XENA databases. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to assess overall survival (OS) differences, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized to evaluate the prognostic predictive abilities of these genes. Genetic alterations were analyzed using the cBioPortal platform, while immune infiltration was examined through ssGSEA and Spearman correlation analysis. Functional enrichment analysis of co-expressed genes was conducted using the KEGG and GO databases. TNFAIP8, TNFAIP8L1, TNFAIP8L2, and TNFAIP8L3 were significantly overexpressed in AML tissues compared to normal tissues (P\u2009<\u20090.001). However, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed no significant association between their expression levels and OS in AML patients. ROC curve analysis showed that TNFAIP8L2 had the highest predictive accuracy (AUC\u2009=\u20091.000) among the family members, followed by TNFAIP8L1 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.728), TNFAIP8 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.709), and TNFAIP8L3 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.629). Clinicopathological analysis indicated that TNFAIP8 and TNFAIP8L1 expressions were associated with poor cytogenetic risk, while TNFAIP8L3 expression correlated strongly with elevated bone marrow blasts (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Mutation analysis revealed a low frequency of genetic alterations, with TNFAIP8L1 being the only gene with mutations in 0.53% of cases. Immune infiltration analysis demonstrated that TNFAIP8 and TNFAIP8L3 were positively correlated with myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), while TNFAIP8L1 expression was associated with natural killer (NK) cell enrichment. TNFAIP8 family genes play distinct roles in AML pathogenesis and immune regulation. TNFAIP8L2 shows promise as a prognostic biomarker, while TNFAIP8 and TNFAIP8L1 may indicate adverse cytogenetic risk. The study highlights their potential as therapeutic targets in AML.",

Our study reveals an unusual mechanism by which EYA3 reduces the presence of cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells in the premetastatic niche (PMN) to enhance metastasis, independent of its effects on the primary tumor. We find that EYA3 up-regulates nuclear factor \u03baB signaling to enhance CCL2 expression, which, in contrast to previous findings, suppresses cytotoxic NK cell activation in vitro and their infiltration into the PMN in vivo.

          "abstract": "The tumor suppressor protein p53 (TP53) is frequently mutated in various types of human malignancies, including HNSCC, which affects tumor growth, prognosis, and treatment. Gaining insight into the impact of TP53 mutations in HNSCC is crucial for developing new diagnostic and therapeutic methods. In this study, we aimed to investigate the influence of mutations on the structure and functions of the TP53 protein and miRNA expression using computational analysis. The genomic data of patients with HNSCC were obtained from TCGA, and the impact of mutations on the TP53 gene was investigated using different bioinformatics tools. Results: The findings showed that the TP53 mutations increased TP53 expression levels in HNSCC and were associated with a poor prognosis. Furthermore, hsa-mir-133b expression was reduced in TP53-mutated samples, significantly affecting patient survival in HNSCC. Six mutations, including R273C, G105C, G266E, Q136H/P, and R280G, were identified as deleterious, carcinogenic, driver, highly conserved, and exposed. These mutations were located in the P53 domain, and PTM analysis revealed that R280G and R273C are at a methylation site, and R273C, Q136H/P, and R280G are located in the protein pocket. The docking research indicated that these mutations decreased the binding affinity for DNA, with R273C, R280G, G266E, and G105C displaying the most significant differences. The molecular dynamics analysis indicates that R280G, Q136H, and G105C mutations confer a gain of function by stabilizing the TP53-substrate complex. Conclusions: Based on the research findings, the mutations on TP53 were found to have an impact on protein and miRNA expression, development, survival, and progression of HNSCC patients, and has-mir-133b could be a promising novel biomarker for monitoring the progression of HNSCC. It was discovered that G105C and Q136H/P, as novel mutations, affect the function and structure of proteins causing HNSCC, which indicates that they could be interesting subjects for further investigation, diagnostics, and therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, the precise positioning of R280G and R273C within the methylation site and Q136H/P in the binding site has been documented for the first time. Moreover, the G105C, Q136H, and R280G mutations that stabilized TP53 structure and altered its interaction dynamics with substrates may serve as novel potential diagnostic biomarkers in cancer, guiding patient stratification and personalized treatment strategies. The molecular dynamics analysis provides insights into how specific TP53 mutations impact protein structure, stability, and function upon substrate binding, highlighting their role in cancer biology and potential implications for therapeutic interventions. This paper provides a novel understanding of the mechanisms by which these mutations contribute to the development of cancer.",

          "abstract": "Calcium movement and concentration in the cell plays significant roles in normal physiology and in diseases such as cancer. The significance of this ion in oncogenesis suggests that membrane-relevant proteins are involved in its regulation and are deregulated in various cancers. These channels and transporters could be targets for therapeutic interventions. An evaluation of the expression of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in prostate cancer was performed using publicly available genomic and proteome data. Two TRP family members with high expression in prostate cancers, TRPML2 and TRPM4, were chosen for further analysis the uncover the associations of their level of expression with clinical and pathologic prostate cancer characteristics. Several TRP channels were expressed in prostate cancers at the protein level including TRPM4, TRPML1, TRPML2, TRPC1 and TRPP3. At the mRNA level, MCOLN2 and TRPM4 were strongly expressed in a sub-set of prostate cancers. Cases with high MCOLN2 mRNA expression were associated with frequent ERG fusions and a trend for better survival outcomes. In contrast, prostate cancer cases with high TRPM4 mRNA expression were associated with lower ERG fusion frequency than cases with low TRPM4 mRNA expression. The prognosis of prostate cancers with high TRPM4 expression was not different from the prognosis with counterparts having low TRPM4 mRNA expression. TRP channels were expressed in sub-sets of prostate cancers. The two well-expressed channels of the super family, TRPML2 and TRPM4, have divergent associations with the most prevalent prostate cancer molecular aberrations, ERG fusions. These results imply diverse regulations of the TRP channels that would have to be taken into consideration when devising therapeutic interventions targeting individual channels.",

However, the impact of hypoxia and hypoxia-reoxygenation of gastric epithelial cells (GECs) on Helicobacter pylori-mediated gastric cancer (GC) has never been investigated. Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) facilitate H.\u2009pylori adhesion onto GECs. We evaluated the effect of hypoxia and hypoxia-reoxygenation on CEACAM6-mediated H.\u2009pylori binding, infection, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and GEC proliferation. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1\u03b1) and CEACAM6 levels were assessed in various GECs. ROS were measured using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA). Bioinformatics analyses were performed to identify the most prominent stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD)-associated NADPH oxidase (NOX) followed by validation by overexpression/suppression studies and western blotting. GC biopsies were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Hypoxia-exposed, reoxygenated, or control cells were compared for ROS generation and H.\u2009pylori infection. MTT assay determined cell proliferation. Hypoxia and HIF1 mediated upregulation of CEACAM6 in GECs. CEACAM6 significantly promoted ROS generation by inducing NOX4 in hypoxic GECs. HIF1\u03b1, CEACAM6, and NOX4 upregulation was detected in gastritis and GC tissues. H.\u2009pylori infection significantly increased in hypoxia-exposed GECs as compared to normoxic GECs. Infection of hypoxia-reoxygenated GECs also resulted in significantly increased CEACAM6 and NOX4-mediated ROS generation compared to normoxic GECs. In addition, adhesion of H.\u2009pylori, cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) translocation, and GEC proliferation were significantly enhanced in hypoxia-reoxygenated GECs. Collectively, this study established that hypoxia and hypoxia-reoxygenation of GECs facilitate H.\u2009pylori infection and infection-mediated GEC proliferation.",

These alterations to both the immune milieu and circulating metabolome may be leveraged for designing rationale drug combinations with immunotherapeutic agents, once chemotherapy fails. Using publicly available transcriptomic data for breast cancer (BC) patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (GSE162187), we assessed transcriptional alterations that coincide with response to chemotherapy. To further study the metabolic and immune alterations associated with chemotherapeutic resistance, plasma samples from BC patients treated with eribulin, paclitaxel and capecitabine were obtained and assessed via Metabolomics and Luminex, at time of progression as compared to baseline. Transcriptomics analysis revealed enrichment of amino acid and lipid metabolic pathways, as well as immune pathways including B cells, complement cascade and T cells, in patients resistant to chemotherapy. To validate these findings and assess the differences among different chemotherapies, plasma samples were obtained at baseline and disease progression. Increases in IL-18; IL-22, amylin and IL-6 were observed at the time of disease progression on eribulin, capecitabine and paclitaxel, respectively. Metabolically, increases in docosahexaenoic acid and decreases in sphingomyelins; increases in triacylglycerides and decreases in fatty acids, and decreases in glutamic acid, lipids and phosphatidylcholines were observed on disease progression on eribulin, capecitabine and paclitaxel, respectively. Distinct patterns of metabolic and immune dysregulation were associated with resistance to eribulin, capecitabine and paclitaxel. Varied immune and metabolic profiles were specific to each of the three chemotherapies, representing potential novel, and individualized, points of therapeutic leverage.",

These studies have primarily focused on m6A modification.

Here, we predict an RNA m5C methyltransferase, NSUN2, as a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer using various bioinformatics approaches, and verify the potential of NSUN2 as a target through multiple preclinical models. Mechanistically, NSUN2 enhances the stability of TRIM28 mRNA by adding m5C modification, promoting the expression of TRIM28. Concurrently, FOXA1, a prostate cancer lineage-specific transcription factor, transcriptionally activates the expression of NSUN2. Our study confirms the clinical potential of targeting RNA epigenetics for the treatment of prostate cancer and elucidates, mechanistically, how RNA epigenetics participates in the complex biological activities within tumors via the FOXA1-NSUN2-TRIM28 axis.",

However, the clinicopathological features of KRAS wild-type PDAC have not been well studied. Additionally, precancerous lesions occurring in patients with KRAS wild-type PDACs have rarely been characterized. Here, we investigated the clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes of 75 patients with KRAS wild-type PDAC. Molecular analyses were performed in 40 patients using targeted DNA and whole-exome sequencing and targeted RNA sequencing. We demonstrated that patients with metastatic PDAC with wild-type KRAS were younger (median 59.5\u2009years) than those with mutated KRAS (median 67\u2009years, p\u2009<\u20090.000055). The wild-type KRAS status was not a significant prognostic factor for metastatic disease. Molecularly, genes in the RAS pathway are frequently mutated or rearranged (46%, 16/35), including mutations in BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, EGFR, MAP2K1, FGFR1, FGFR3 and ERBB4 and fusions of FGFR2 (FGFR2::CCDC147, FGFR2::CAT, FGFR2::TXLNA), ALK (STRN::ALK, EML4::ALK), and BRAF (TRIP11::BRAF). Mismatch repair deficiency was identified in 10% (4/39) of patients. Potentially actionable alterations were identified frequently in KRAS wild-type PDACs (30%, 12/40), in which nontubular-type carcinomas were significantly enriched with actionable alterations compared with tubular adenocarcinomas [67% (6/9) versus 16% (5/31); p\u2009=\u20090.007]. Finally, we investigated the precursors of PDACs in 13 pancreatectomy specimens from patients with KRAS wild-type PDAC. We identified three pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) and two intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) harboring oncogenic fusions of ALK and BRAF and driver mutations in BRAF and AKT1. This study suggests that in the context of unmutated KRAS, PDAC is driven by alternative oncogenic mutations or fusions of RAS pathway genes, which may be introduced during the early phase of tumorigenesis. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

          "abstract": "Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a prevalent malignancy and there are limited options to block the recurrence and metastasis that often occur in SCC patients. Although IL-6, a proinflammatory cytokine, is strongly implicated in SCC pathogenesis, its mechanism of action is poorly understood. The GPI-anchored membrane protein CD109 is frequently overexpressed in SCC and is associated with malignant transformation. The current study aims to investigate whether CD109 interacts with IL-6 receptor alpha (IL6R\u03b1) and promotes IL-6-mediated oncogenic signaling to drive SCC progression. IL6R\u03b1 interaction with CD109 was determined by coimmunoprecipitation, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and FACS analysis using human SCC (oral and vulvar) cell lines and human oral SCC tumors versus control tissue. Regulation of IL-6-induced signaling and antioxidant responses by CD109 was analyzed via STAT3/NRF2/SOD1/HO1 pathway activation. Regulation of IL-6-mediated tumorigenicity by CD109 was determined using stem cell marker expression and a spheroid formation assay. Clinical validation was achieved using genomic and proteomic analysis of oral SCC tumors and of head and neck SCC patient data. We show that CD109 interacts with and stabilizes IL6R\u03b1 expression and promotes IL-6/STAT3/NRF2 pathway in oral and vulvar SCC cells. Loss of CD109 attenuates this pathway leading to loss of cancer cell stemness and decreased expression of superoxide dismutase1 and heme oxygenase-1, antioxidant proteins important for cell survival after chemotherapy. Furthermore, clinical validation of these findings was achieved through multi-omic analysis of oral SCC tumors and of head and neck SCC patient data. This work uncovers a previously unidentified mechanism in which CD109 serves as an essential regulator of IL6R\u03b1 expression and IL-6 mediated signaling in SCC cells, promoting stemness and antioxidant state, mechanisms known to mediate therapy resistance in SCC. Our findings establish a mechanistic validation for investigating the therapeutic utility of the CD109/ IL6R\u03b1/STAT3/NRF2 pathway in SCC.",

          "abstract": "Amplification of the MYC proto-oncogene is frequently observed in various cancer types, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Emerging evidence suggests that suppression of local antitumor immune responses by MYC, at least in part, explains the tumor-promoting effects of MYC. Specifically, MYC upregulation was demonstrated to suppress the tumor-cell intrinsic activation of a type I interferon response and thereby hamper innate inflammatory signaling, which may contribute to the disappointing response to immunotherapy in patients with TNBC. In this study, we show that MYC interferes with protein expression and functionality of the STING pathway. MYC-mediated STING downregulation in BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell lines requires the DNA-binding ability of MYC and is independent of binding of MYC to its co-repressor MIZ1. Both STAT1 and STAT3 promote the steady-state expression levels of STING, and STAT3 cooperates with MYC in regulating STING. Conversely, MYC-mediated downregulation of STING affects protein levels of STAT1 and downstream chemokine production. Furthermore, we show that MYC overexpression hampers immune cell activation triggered by DNA damage through etoposide or irradiation treatment and specifically impedes the activation of natural killer cells. Collectively, these results show that MYC controls STING levels and thereby regulates tumor cell-intrinsic inflammatory signaling. These results contribute to our understanding of how MYC suppresses inflammatory signaling in TNBC and may explain why a large fraction of patients with TNBC do not benefit from immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Luminal breast cancer (BC) is generally associated with a lower risk of recurrence compared with other subtypes. However, patients with luminal BC can still experience recurrence, which remains a significant concern and contributes to BC-related mortality. Current clinical practice for recurrence risk prognosis relies on prognostic tests based on tumor gene expression profiles. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between different genetic alterations with the likelihood of recurrence and gene expression prognostic prediction (Oncotype DX\u00ae, MammaPrint\u00ae, and PAM50-ROR) in luminal BC patients. We constructed three transcriptome-based predictive models, based on these widely used clinical tests, to evaluate the recurrence risk of patients with luminal BC, using RNA-seq data from 1527 samples across 11 datasets. We further classified 1780 patients from the TCGA and METABRIC datasets into risk groups and detected distinct recurrence risk patterns. Our analysis revealed that low-risk groups had higher frequencies of mutations in PIK3CA, MAP3K1, CDH1, KMT2C, and CBFB, as well as co-mutations in PIK3CA-MAP3K1, PIK3CA-CBFB, and KMT2C-MAP3K1. In contrast, high-risk groups showed enrichment of TP53, RB1, and PTPN22 mutations compared with the whole cohort, with notable co-mutations in TP53-PIK3CA and TP53-KMT2C. Furthermore, mutations in TP53 and BRCA2, and deletions in the 7p22.3 region were at least threefold more frequent in high-risk patients compared with low-risk patients. Using an independent dataset, we validated our finding of higher frequency of BRCA2 mutations in Oncotype DX\u00ae high-risk patients. Notably, PIK3CA mutations had an unexpected negative impact on recurrence and survival among high-risk patients. Our study reveals key genetic factors associated with recurrence risk in luminal BC. Identifying these mutations and copy number alterations provides a basis for refined prognostic models and suggests avenues for further research, potentially improving treatment strategies and follow-up care for patients with luminal BC.",

          "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent cancers, posing a significant threat to human life. Although therapeutic approaches for advanced-stage patients have improved in recent years, there is still room for enhancing treatment response. Recent evidence suggests that dysregulation of nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) is associated with the development and progression of tumors. Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential therapeutic and prognostic implications of the solute carrier family 35 A (SLC35A) members in CRC. To achieve this, we performed integrative bioinformatics analysis using various publicly available databases, including GENT2, TCGA, UALCAN, cBioPortal, Kaplan-Meier plotter, The ROC plotter, GDSC, TISIDB, and TIMER. We compared gene expression profiles between CRC tumors and adjacent normal tissues, revealing that only SLC35A2 exhibited significant upregulation in tumors, while the other family members were downregulated. Additionally, higher SLC35A2 expression was found in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal tumors. Further analysis of TCGA and GEO datasets showed that patients with high SLC35A2 expression experienced poorer relapse-free survival. Next, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and the results indicated that the upregulation of SLC35A2 is linked to cellular metabolism pathways, such as MYC Targets V2, Steroid Biosynthesis, Pentose Phosphate Pathway, and TCA Cycle. Furthermore, our CRC cell models revealed the tumor-promoting role of SLC35A2 and discovered that the upregulation of SLC35A2 is associated with chemoresistance against irinotecan. Additionally, we observed a negative correlation between SLC35A2 expression and the infiltration of immune cells, particularly cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and B cells. This suggests the immunomodulatory role of SLC35A2. In summary, SLC35A2 is abnormally upregulated in CRC, and patients with high SLC35A2 expression tend to have poor relapse-free survival. This may be due to its involvement in regulating cancer cell metabolic reprogramming, promoting tumor progression, modulating the immune landscape, and influencing treatment response. Consequently, SLC35A2 could serve as a significant prognostic factor and a potential therapeutic target in CRC.",

We also used ChIP-Seq to explore SAE1's transcriptional regulation and analysed clinical data, drug sensitivity and molecular docking models. SAE1 mRNA was significantly overexpressed in PAAD, with a substantial impact on cell proliferation and migration. Functional analyses linked SAE1 to cell cycle and DNA replication pathways, suggesting a role in PAAD development.

          "abstract": "SLC16A3, belonging to the SLC16 gene family, is involved in the transportation of monocarboxylate. SLC16A family members play important roles in tumorigenesis, nonetheless, the specific involvement of SLC16A3 in tumor prognosis and diagnosis in human cancers remains unelucidated. This study dealt with the exploration of SLC16A3 expression in human pan-cancer and its significance regarding disease prognosis. For this investigation, the mRNA expression data of SLC16A3 were acquired from the TCGA and the GTEx datasets. The Kaplan-Meier plots, univariate Cox regression, and the ROC curve were employed for assessing the prognostic and diagnostic significance of SLC16A3 in pan-cancer. Furthermore, the cBioPortal database was used to analyze the SLC16A3 genomic alterations. Moreover, the association of the infiltration of immune cells and immune checkpoint genes with SLC16A3 was analyzed by the TIMER database. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analysis were employed to explore the function of SLC16A3 in pan-cancer. The resulting data demonstrated that SLC16A3 mRNA expression was overexpressed in most cancers and its protein expression was also high across diverse cancer types. Moreover, upregulated SLC16A3 expression was linked to poor OS and PFI of certain cancers. Cox regression analysis further indicated that SLC16A3 is a risk factor for patients with PAAD, CESC, LUSC, LUAD, CHOL, LGG, MESO, and OSCC. The ROC curve revealed that SLC16A3 exhibited a high accuracy (AUC\u2009>\u20090.9) in BRCA, CHOL, ESCA, GBM, and KIRC prediction. Moreover, the acquired data indicated that in pan-cancer, the SLC16A3 expression exhibited correlations with immune checkpoint genes and immune cells. These findings collectively suggest that SLC16A3 holds promise as a biomarker for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in pan-cancer.",

This study aimed to investigate the expression pattern, prognostic significance, and relationship with tumor immune infiltration of PBK/TOPK in breast cancer through bioinformatics analyses and immunohistochemistry (IHC), providing insights for individualized treatment and immunotherapy strategies. PBK/TOPK expression and its correlation with clinicopathological features were analyzed using TIMER, UALCAN, and TCGA databases. Prognostic value was assessed via Kaplan-Meier plotter and bc-GenExMiner. Variants of the PBK/TOPK gene and their prognostic implications were explored using cBioPortal. Enrichment analysis in R identified signaling pathways linked to PBK/TOPK. The relationships between PBK/TOPK, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and immune cell markers were evaluated using TIMER and TISIDB. IHC experiments validated PBK/TOPK expression in tumor samples and its association with prognosis. Meanwhile, IHC also further confirmed the correlation between PBK/TOPK and CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells infiltration, as well as the relationship between T cells and breast cancer prognosis. PBK/TOPK was significantly overexpressed in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues and correlated with clinicopathological features, including tumor size and lymph node stage. High expression of PBK/TOPK was associated with poor prognosis. While breast cancer subtypes exhibited different PBK/TOPK gene variants, these variants did not influence prognosis. PBK/TOPK is involved in cell meiosis, cytoskeletal motility, and pathways such as FoxO and p53. It is associated with immune infiltration and is differentially expressed in breast cancer subtypes and correlates with TILs and immune cell markers. IHC confirms that PBK/TOPK expression positively correlates with CD4<sup>+</sup>\u2009T and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells infiltration. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were positively associated with the prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer. PBK/TOPK is overexpressed in breast cancer tissues, and high expression levels are associated with poor patient prognosis.

Despite significant advances in precision oncology driven by large-scale international consortia, gaps persist in understanding the genomic landscape of thyroid cancer and its impact on therapeutic efficacy across diverse populations. To address this gap, we performed comprehensive data mining and <i>in silico</i> analyses to identify pathogenic variants in thyroid cancer driver genes, calculate allele frequencies, and assess deleteriousness scores across global populations, including African, Amish, Ashkenazi Jewish, East and South Asian, Finnish and non-Finnish European, Latino, and Middle Eastern groups. Additionally, pharmacogenomic profiling, <i>in silico</i> drug prescription, and clinical trial data were analyzed to prioritize targeted therapeutic strategies. Our analysis examined 56,622 variants in 40 thyroid cancer-driver genes across 76,156 human genomes, identifying 5,001 known and predicted oncogenic variants. Enrichment analysis revealed critical pathways such as MAPK, PI3K-AKT-mTOR, and p53 signaling, underscoring their roles in thyroid cancer pathogenesis. High-throughput validation strategies confirmed actionable genomic alterations in RET, BRAF, NRAS, KRAS, and EPHA7. Ligandability assessments identified these proteins as promising therapeutic targets. Furthermore, our findings highlight the clinical potential of targeted drug inhibitors, including vandetanib, dabrafenib, and selumetinib, for improving treatment outcomes. This study underscores the significance of integrating genomic insights with pharmacogenomic strategies to address disparities in thyroid cancer treatment. The identification of population-specific oncogenic variants and actionable therapeutic targets provides a foundation for advancing precision oncology. Future efforts should focus on including underrepresented populations, developing population-specific prevention strategies, and fostering global collaboration to ensure equitable access to pharmacogenomic testing and innovative therapies. These initiatives have the potential to transform thyroid cancer care and align with the broader goals of personalized medicine.",

With the recent introduction of RAS inhibitors, we can now directly investigate the effects of specific RAS mutations in cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrate that in tumors with RASG12X mutations, mutant RAS can be activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), and PI3K activation is dependent on mutant RAS. Conversely, RASQ61X mutations activate the MAPK cascade independently of RTKs, and inhibition of RASQ61X impairs MAPK pathway activation but leaves the PI3K pathway unaffected. Our characterization of these distinct features of G12X and Q61X mutations suggests that co-inhibition of RAS and RTKs selectively inhibits the growth of RASG12X-mutant tumors, both in vitro and in vivo, regardless of the RAS isoform and tumor type. Additionally, our findings offer a mechanistic explanation for the increased frequency of RASQ61X mutations as a secondary resistance mechanism against EGFR inhibition in colorectal cancer. RAS inhibition in multiple tumor types reveals the difference between G12 mutants and Q61 mutants in their cooperation with upstream regulators and downstream effectors to promote oncogenic signaling. Our findings provide the rationale for combinatorial approaches and contribute to explaining the nonuniform distribution of RAS mutations, de novo and at resistance.",

          "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a challenging and malignant cancer, primarily originates from the exocrine cells of the pancreas. The superfamily of solute carrier (SLC) transporters, consisting of more than 450 proteins divided into 65 families, is integral to various cellular processes and represents a promising target in precision oncology. As therapeutic targets, SLC transporters are explored through an integrative analysis. The expression profiles of SLCs were systematically analyzed using mRNA data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and protein data from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA). Survival analysis was examined to evaluate the prognostic significance of SLC transporters for overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Genetic alterations were examined using cBioPortal, while structural studies were performed with AlphaFold and AlphaMissense to predict functional impacts. Furthermore, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was carried out to identify oncogenic pathways linked to SLC transporter expression. SLC transporters were significantly upregulated in tumors relative to normal tissues. Higher expression levels of SLC39A10 (HR = 1.89, <i>p</i> = 0.0026), SLC22B5 (HR = 1.84, <i>p</i> = 0.0042), SLC55A2 (HR = 2.15, <i>p</i> = 0.00023), and SLC30A6 (HR = 1.90, <i>p</i> = 0.003) were strongly associated with unfavorable OS, highlighting their connection to poor prognosis in PDAC. GSEA highlighted that these four transporters are significantly involved in key oncogenic pathways, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), TNF-\u03b1 signaling, and angiogenesis. The study identifies four SLCs as therapeutic targets in PDAC, highlighting their crucial role in essential metabolic pathways. These findings lay the groundwork for developing next-generation metabolic anti-cancer treatment to improve survival for PDAC patients.",

          "abstract": "The myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family genes were involved in the carcinogenesis and prognosis of multiple human tumors. The impact of MEF2s on the occurrences, progression, and clinical outcome of pancreatic cancer (PAAD) remains unknown. This study used the CCLE, HPA, EMBL-EBI, and GEPIA2 databases to study MEF2s expression in PAAD patients. We also investigated the relationship between MEF2s expression and methylation through the DiseaseMeth database, and used MEXPRESS to verify the association. Then we utilized the Kaplan-Meier Plotter and GEPIA2 databases to evaluate the prognostic value of MEF2s in PAAD. The cBioPortal database was used to explore the alteration features of MEF2s in PAAD. We then investigated the association between MEF2s expression, immune cells infiltration, and immune infiltration markers using the TIMER database. Finally, Metascape, STRING, and Cytoscape tools were used for functional enrichment analysis. MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D were found to be highly expressed in PAAD patients' tissues compared to normal tissues, whereas MEF2B expression did not show significant differential expression. In addition, the protein expression of MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D was higher in PAAD tissues. Negative correlations were observed between the expression level of MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D and the methylation levels in multiple sites. High expression of MEF2A was related to poor overall survival (p\u2009=\u20090.0071) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (p\u2009=\u20090.0089) of PAAD. High expression of MEF2C was associated with worse RFS of PAAD (p\u2009=\u20090.043). MEF2A was a Truncating mutation, and it was shown that the \"G27Wfs*8\" mutation point was distributed in the SRF-TF domain. Both MEF2C and MEF2D were a Missense mutation. MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D expression was positively corresponded with five immune cells infiltration (CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells, B-cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells), especially for CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells and macrophages. Among the 20 pathways, hsa05140 (Leishmania infection), hsa04022 (cGMP-PKG signaling pathway), hsa05145 (Toxoplasmosis), hsa04371 (Apelin signaling pathway), and hsa04064 (NF-kappa B signaling pathway), were closely connected with the occurrence and development of PAAD. Our results indicated that the overexpression of MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D in patients with PAAD. MEF2A could be used as a prognostic biomarker for PAAD, MEF2C might be a potential oncogene for PAAD, and MEF2D had potential biological significance.",

Malignancies in women with a family history of breast cancer may be detectable based on DNA methylation and microRNA. <b>Objectives</b>: The present study extended an integrative analysis of DNA methylation and microRNA to identify genes associated with biopsychosocial factors. <b>Methods</b>: We identified 3060 healthy women from the Taiwan Biobank and included 32 blood plasma samples for analysis of biopsychosocial factors and epigenetic changes. GEO databases and bioinformatics approaches were used for the identification and validation of potential genes. <b>Results</b>: Our integrative analysis revealed GNPDA1 and SLC25A16 as potential genes. Age, a family history of cancer, and alcohol consumption were associated with GNPDA1 and SLC25A16 based on the current data set and the GEO data set. GNPDA1 and SLC25A16 exhibited significant expression in breast cancer tissues based on UALCAN analysis, where they were overexpressed and underexpressed, respectively. Through a MethSurv analysis, GNPDA1 hypomethylation and SLC25A16 hypermethylation were associated with poor prognoses in terms of overall survival in breast cancer. Moreover, through a MetaCore functional enrichment analysis, GNPDA1 and SLC25A16 were associated with the BRCA1, BRCA2, and pro-oncogenic actions of the androgen receptor in breast cancer. Further, GNPDA1 and SLC25A16 were enriched in known targets of approved cancer drugs as potential genes associated with breast cancer. <b>Conclusions</b>: These two genes might serve as biomarkers for the early detection of breast cancer, especially for women with a family history of breast cancer.",

Here, we describe two thyroid tumors with pathogenic <i>FLCN</i> alterations-one germline and one somatic-and analyze the broader prevalence and significance of <i>FLCN</i> in thyroid carcinomas using multiple large sequencing datasets, including ORIEN-AVATAR. Patient 1, with a germline <i>FLCN</i> mutation and a history of BHD syndrome, presented with a well-circumscribed oncocytic adenoma. Molecular testing confirmed biallelic <i>FLCN</i> inactivation, but no additional mutations or aggressive features were observed, and the patient remained disease-free post-thyroidectomy. Patient 2 harbored a somatic <i>FLCN</i> mutation in an oncocytic poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma, which exhibited extensive angioinvasion, high proliferative activity, and concurrent TP53 and RB1 mutations. The tumor progressed with metastatic disease despite multimodal treatment. Thyroid carcinomas revealed <i>FLCN</i> alterations in 1.1% of cases. Pathogenic mutations were rare but associated with oncocytic morphology, while homozygous deletions occurred more frequently in genomically unstable tumors, including anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. These findings suggest <i>FLCN</i> mutations may act as early oncogenic drivers in oncocytic thyroid neoplasms, while deletions represent secondary events in aggressive tumor evolution. The lack of <i>FLCN</i> coverage in standard thyroid molecular panels likely underestimates its clinical relevance. Including <i>FLCN</i> in genetic testing could improve tumor detection and characterization, particularly in BHD patients who may benefit from routine thyroid screening. Further studies are needed to clarify <i>FLCN</i>'s role in thyroid cancer pathogenesis.",

There is a lack of more detailed research on the biological function of GTF2E2 in pan-cancer. We conducted a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Employing a multi-pronged approach with tools including R, Cytoscape, TISIDB, cBioPortal, STRING, GSCALite, and CancerSEA, we investigated GTF2E2's expression patterns, prognostic value, mutational landscape, functional enrichment, and immunological associations across 33 cancer types. Besides, we further validated the bioinformatic results through in vitro experiments in Uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), including western blotting (WB), cell proliferation assays and transwell. DCFH-DA, C11-BODIPY 581/591 and FeRhoNox-1 probes were performed to identify ferroptosis levels in vitro. GTF2E2 expression was significantly elevated in most cancers compared to normal tissues, with notable diagnostic potential (AUC > 0.7) in 20 cancer types. GTF2E2 expression varied across molecular and immune subtypes and correlated with tumor stage and patient age in several cancers. Functional enrichment analyses highlighted GTF2E2's involvement in key cancer-related and immunological pathways. Notably, GTF2E2 promoted UCEC progression in vitro, and knockdown of GTF2E2 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of UCEC cells. Compared with the control group, GPX4 expression was down-regulated and ACSL4 expression was up-regulated in the GTF2E2-knockdown group. Knockdown of GTF2E2 also increased the intracellular levels of Fe2+, lipid peroxides (LPOs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our findings underscore GTF2E2's multifaceted roles in cancer biology, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker, prognostic indicator, and immunotherapeutic target across various malignancies. This investigation has the potential to contribute significantly to a deeper understanding of the substantial involvement of GTF2E2 in human malignancies, particularly UCEC.",

          "abstract": "Studies have indicated that cyclin dependent protein kinase inhibitor 2B (CDKN2B) deletion is one of the most common changes in esophageal cancer (EC) which affects its progression and prognosis. This study explored the association between CDKN2B deletion, immunophenotype, and the prognosis of EC. We investigated CDKN2B status and RNA expression, identified differentially expressed immune-associated genes between wild-type CDKN2B (CDKN2B<sup>WT</sup>) and deleted CDKN2B (CDKN2B<sup>deletion</sup>) in Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) EC samples. We also a constructed an immune prognostic model (IPM) based on these genes. Thereafter, the effects of IPM on the immune microenvironment of EC were analyzed. Finally, we established a nomogram by integrating the IPM and other clinical factors. CDKN2B deletion leads to downregulation of the immune response in EC. A total of 136 immune-associated genes were identified based on the CDKN2B deletion status, and three genes with remarkable potential as individual targets were selected for model construction. An IPM was developed and validated, it showed good performance in differentiating patients with a low or high risk of poor prognosis, and its predictive ability was independent of traditional clinical features. High-risk patients with EC had increased T follicular helper cells (Tfh) and M0 macrophages, and lower infiltration levels of resting CD4 memory T cells resting, and naive B cells. The nomogram developed for clinical application showed good predictive performance. Our results suggested that CDKN2B deletion was associated with the survival and immune microenvironment in EC. IPM is not only an effective indicator of the immune response and prognosis, but also suggest potential targets for immunotherapy in patients with EC.",

The interplay between c-MET, SRC, AXL expression, and their gene mutation patterns in different renal carcinoma subtypes is unclear. To improve the understanding of these signaling pathways, we analyzed c-MET, AXL, and SRC expression in 590 clear cell RCC (ccRCC) and 127 papillary RCC (pRCC) by immunohistochemistry and integrated sequencing data to investigate the frequency of MET, AXL, and SRC gene mutations, their expression levels, and the presence of splice variants. In TCGA and in Foundation Medicine, Inc. (FMI) datasets, AXL and SRC gene alterations were extremely rare (<2%) or absent in ccRCC (n\u2009=\u2009531 and 2,781, respectively) and pRCC (n\u2009=\u2009290 and 566, respectively). On the other hand, MET mutations or amplifications were found in 9.7% (TCGA) and 10.2% (FMI) of pRCC. We show that strong SRC staining intensity by immunohistochemistry is associated with high tumor stage, high grade, and shorter survival in ccRCC (p\u2009<\u20090.001 each). AXL expression correlates with high stage and grade in ccRCC (p\u2009<\u20090.001 each). Both SRC and AXL expression were independent prognostic parameters in multivariate analysis (p\u2009<\u20090.05). MET expression is associated with longer survival in pRCC (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Our TCGA data analysis aligns with SRC immunohistochemistry findings on tumor stage and shorter survival in ccRCC. TCGA expression data showed a moderate positive correlation between AXL and c-MET in pRCC. In addition, we identified alternative splicing events reported for AXL in pRCC, and MET and SRC in ccRCC, across various alternative splicing databases. In conclusion, we identified high SRC expression as a biomarker for poor prognosis of ccRCC. Our data demonstrate c-MET, AXL, and SRC signaling pathway interactions independent of c-MET, AXL, and SRC mutations in ccRCC.",

This review first introduces genetic aberrations that cause cancer development.

To address this gap, we established a comprehensive database encompassing 9965 genes, 5449 proteins, 1121 metabolites, 283 pathways, 854 imaging features, and 73 clinical factors from colorectal cancer patients. This database identifies significantly distinct molecules and imaging features associated with clinical phenotypes and provides survival analysis based on these features. Additionally, it offers genetic molecule annotations, comparative expression levels between tumor and normal tissues, imaging features linked to genetic molecules, and imaging-based models for predicting gene expression levels. Furthermore, the database highlights correlations between genetic molecules, clinical factors, and imaging features. In summary, we present MIPD (Molecules, Imaging, and Clinical Phenotype Correlation Database), a user-friendly, interactive, and specialized platform accessible at http://corgenerf.com.

The retrieval time was from inception to October, 2023. The meta-analysis of the included literatures was conducted by the STATA 12.0 software. Additionally, the expression profiles of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in tumor and normal gastric tissues were analyzed, and their clinical drug relevance was assessed using the CPADS database. The research program has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023495836). The analysis demonstrated elevated mRNA expression of both Piezo1 and Piezo2 in the majority of tumor samples. Of particular note was the significant increase observed in GC tissue compared to normal tissue (all p\u2009<\u20090.05).

This study addresses the limited understanding of lactate metabolism-related genes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) by constructing a prognostic risk model centered on these genes to enhance prediction and treatment strategies for HNSC. Utilizing the Lactate Metabolism score (LMs) derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we identified five key genes significantly associated with prognosis in HNSC patients. These genes were integrated into a prognostic risk model developed through Cox regression analysis, which demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving area under the curve (AUC) values greater than 0.8 for five-year survival. The risk scores generated by our model were significantly correlated with critical features of the tumor microenvironment, including immune characteristics and markers of immune evasion. Higher risk scores correlated with a more tumor-promoting microenvironment and increased immune suppression, underscoring the model's relevance in understanding HNSC progression. Additionally, eight critical hub genes were identified, revealing significant differences in gene expression between risk score groups. Functional analyses demonstrated that the low-risk group exhibited a more favorable prognosis and enhanced immune characteristics. Our findings suggest that the lactate metabolism-based prognostic model may have implications for guiding the development of personalized treatment approaches, as it highlights the potential for targeted interventions that could modulate the tumor microenvironment and immune response.",

Two risk groups, high-risk and low-risk, were identified. The model demonstrated a robust capacity to predict prognosis, with a worse overall survival for patients in the high-risk group. Additionally, differential expression of the seven lncRNAs were relatively higher in AML samples than in control samples via quantitative polymerase chain reaction(qPCR). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and immune infiltration analysis revealed a substantial infiltration of immune cells and enrichment of immune pathways in the high-risk group. The sensitivity of AML patients to drugs varied according to their risk grade. This study identified a DRL signature, which can effectively predict the prognosis of AML and better understand the mechanism of disulfidptosis in AML. This provides a basis for personalized immunotherapy in AML patients.",

          "abstract": "SWI/SNF (switch/sucrose non-fermentable) chromatin remodelers possess unique functionalities difficult to dissect. Distinct cancers harbor mutations in specific subunits, such as the polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF)-specific component ARID2 in melanoma. Here, we perform epigenomic profiling of SWI/SNF complexes and their associated chromatin states in melanocytes and melanoma. Time-resolved approaches reveal that PBAF regions are generally less sensitive to ATPase inhibition than BAF sites. We further uncover a subset of PBAF-exclusive regions within Polycomb-repressed chromatin that are enriched for REST (RE1 silencing transcription factor), a transcription factor that represses neuronal genes. In turn, PBAF complex disruption via ARID2 loss hinders REST's ability to bind and inactivate its targets, leading to upregulation of synaptic transcripts. Remarkably, this gene signature is conserved in melanoma patients with ARID2 mutations and correlates with an expression program enriched in melanoma brain metastases. Overall, we demonstrate a unique role for PBAF in generating accessibility for a silencing transcription factor at repressed chromatin, with important implications for disease.",

          "abstract": "To explore novel biomarkers capable of predicting the prognosis of gastric cancer (GC) and investigate the mechanisms underlying the development of GC. Firstly, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GC tumors and adjacent tissues were analyzed using transcriptome sequencing data. Then, the DEGs significantly associated with the prognosis of GC were selected. From this subset, genes with high protein expression levels in tumor tissues were focused. Multivariate hazard analysis was performed to further identify DEGs with independent prognostic value for GC patients. Eventually, the potential mechanisms involving DEGs that underlie the development of GC were investigated. Altogether, 25 previously DEGs that have not been reported before were discovered in the context of GC. Among these genes, ADAMTSL2, DSCC1, COL5A3, F2RL2, GRIN2D, IGSF6, IER5L, PLA2G7, PODNL1, RCN3 and RTN4RL2 were significantly associated with the overall survival, first progression and post progression survival of GC patients. Moreover, protein levels of ADAMTSL2, COL5A3, DSCC1, GRIN2D, PODNL1 and RCN3 were consistently highly expressed in clinical GC specimens. Furthermore, multivariate hazard analysis identified ADAMTSL2 as an independent predictor of GC prognosis. Further exploration revealed a potential regulatory connection between ADAMTSL2 and hsa-miR-7-2-3p. hsa-miR-7-2-3p was significantly down-regulated in GC and GC patients with low expression of hsa-miR-7 had a poor overall survival. Additionally, ADAMTSL2 was significantly co-expressed with key molecules (NOTCH1, NOTCH3, NOTCH4 and HEY1) in Notch signaling pathway. ADAMTSL2 stands out as an independent predictor for the prognosis of GC and may play a crucial pathological role in the development of GC.",

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a biological process enabling epithelial cells to acquire mesenchymal traits associated with enhanced migratory and invasive capacities, plays a crucial role in cancer progression. Protein Regulator of Cytokinesis 1 (PRC1) is a critical protein in cell division, whose overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in various cancers. This study investigates the role of PRC1 as a key prognostic factor in WT and explore the mechanism through comprehensive bioinformatic and experimental approaches. Through bulk RNA-seq data from the TARGET database, we identified PRC1 as significantly up-regulated in WT and associated with poor overall survival. Functional enrichment analyses (GO, KEGG, GSEA) demonstrated PRC1's involvement in cell division, chromatin dynamics, and activation of oncogenic pathways including Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and Hedgehog signaling. Immunological analysis showed that elevated PRC1 expression correlates with diminished immune cell activity, particularly in NK cells, suggesting potential immune evasion mechanisms. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis (GSE200256) confirmed PRC1's elevated expression in anaplastic Wilms tumor (AWT) compared to favorable Wilms tumor (FWT), and highlighted its involvement in intercellular communication and metastasis via the EMT process. Genomic analyses identified copy number variations (CNVs) and downregulated PRC1-targeting microRNAs as drivers of its overexpression. In vitro, PRC1 knockdown in WIT-49 cells significantly impaired migratory capacity, invasive potential, EMT progression, and glycolytic metabolism. These findings collectively position PRC1 as a promising therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in WT.",

This study aims to explore DEFB1 expression, genetic alterations, immune infiltration, and prognostic significance across various cancer types. We analyzed DEFB1 expression and its association with cancer prognosis using data from public platforms, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and Human Protein Atlas (HPA). Additionally, we examined DEFB1 genetic alterations, immune cell infiltration, and its molecular partners using various bioinformatics tools. DEFB1 expression was highest in salivary glands, kidneys, and pancreas. In cancers, DEFB1 was upregulated in cholangiocarcinoma, kidney chromophobe, and melanoma, but downregulated in breast, colon, and rectal cancers. High DEFB1 expression was linked to poorer overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but better survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Genetic analysis revealed alterations in liver and gastric cancers. Immune infiltration analysis showed a correlation between DEFB1 and cancer-associated fibroblasts in liver cancer, while neutrophil infiltration was linked to bladder carcinoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma. Key genes associated with DEFB1 included KLK1, BSND, and CLCNKB. This study highlights DEFB1's potential as a prognostic biomarker and its influence on the tumor immune microenvironment across different cancers. These findings suggest DEFB1 could be a target for future cancer therapies, although further studies are needed to validate these results.",

Colon cancer cells deficient in p53 activate fibroblasts and enhance fibroblast-mediated tumor growth. Meflin is a CAF marker capable of inhibiting tumor growth. In this study, we investigated the role of Meflin in fibroblasts using human cell lines (colon cancer HCT116 and fibroblasts CCD-18Co) and clinical specimens. TP53-suppressed HCT116 (HCT116<sup>sh p53</sup>) cells cocultured with CCD-18Co cells showed significantly faster proliferation than HCT116<sup>sh control</sup> cells. In xenograft experiments, the volume of tumors induced by coinoculation with HCT116<sup>sh p53</sup> and CCD-18Co cells was significantly larger than that induced by HCT116<sup>sh control</sup> cells co-inoculated with CCD-18Co cells. HCT116<sup>sh p53</sup> cells increased the levels of CAF-like phenotypic markers in CCD-18Co cells. Moreover, Meflin expression was significantly reduced in CCD-18Co cells cocultured with HCT116<sup>sh p53</sup> cells compared to that in CCD-18Co cells cocultured with HCT116<sup>sh control</sup> cells. si-RNA-mediated inhibition of Meflin activated CCD-18Co cells into tumor-promoting CAF-like cells, which significantly promoted xenograft tumor growth. Overexpression of Meflin in CCD-18Co cells using lentivirus suppressed fibroblast-mediated growth of HCT116<sup>sh p53</sup> tumor xenografts. The expression of Meflin in CCD-18Co cells was suppressed by TGF-\u03b2 and enhanced by vitamin D. These results indicate that colon cancer cells deficient in p53 suppress Meflin expression in fibroblasts, which affects tumor growth by altering the properties of tumor growth-promoting CAFs. Our results suggest that targeting Meflin in fibroblasts may be a novel therapeutic strategy for colorectal cancer.",

Additionally, studies have investigated the correlation between NLRP1 and various survival metrics, infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts, genetic alterations, drug sensitivity, and promoter methylation. Furthermore, research has explored the potential roles of NLRP1 and its interactions with other proteins. Our analysis revealed decreased expression of NLRP1 in BLCA, BRCA, KICH, LUAD, LUSC, PRAD, and UCEC tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. We identified a significant correlation between NLRP1 expression and various cancer survival parameters, genetic mutations, and immune infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts. Furthermore, we observed that NLRP1 expression is regulated by promoter DNA methylation in ESCA. Abnormal expression of NLRP1 was associated with decreased sensitivity to multiple anti-tumor drugs and small compounds. NLRP1 was found to be involved in pathways associated with T cell receptors and chemokines. Reduced NLRP1 expression contributes to cancer progression and holds potential as a crucial biomolecular marker for diagnostic, prognostic, and personalized therapeutic interventions across different malignancies.",

This study combined bioinformatics, molecular docking, and experimental assays to tackle this challenge. We identified 166 ovarian cancer-related genes, with MYC standing out as a key target. Analysis of MYC mutations revealed prevalent alterations, though no significant survival differences were observed in patients with or without the mutations. Molecular docking pinpointed compound B155 as a promising MYC inhibitor. A preliminary cytotoxicity assay revealed compound B155's notable activity, with an 87.19\u00a0% inhibition of cell viability at 50\u00a0\u03bcM. Most of the other curcumin analogues only caused more than 50\u00a0% inhibition at the same concentration. This result suggests alternative mechanisms of action, possibly antioxidant effects, warranting further exploration. In summary, this study unveiled MYC as a prime target for ovarian cancer treatment, with curcumin analogues like B155 showing potential.

In this study, we explored tumor growth-regulatory signaling between differentially educated non-malignant mesenchymal stromal cells and malignant cells in pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Xenograft experiments demonstrated that non-malignant stromal cells influence tumor behavior. Gene expression analysis identified deregulated genes, which were further studied using cell culture assays and patient data. Clinicopathological correlations were made in a discovery cohort (N\u2009=\u2009147) and a validation cohort (N\u2009=\u2009101). The results revealed transiently suppressive paracrine effects of orthotopic stromal cells derived from skeletal muscle. These effects were lost when the stromal cells were exposed to RMS cells, either short-term in vitro, or long-term in hindlimb muscle in vivo. High resolution microarray-based Clariom D gene expression analysis identified insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) as the top upregulated gene in RMS cells exposed to na\u00efve stromal cells, and effects on growth arrest, caspase 3/7 activation, and myogenic cell identity were demonstrated in functional assays. Furthermore, IGFBP5 associated with the caspase 3 substrate growth arrest specific protein 2 (GAS2), lower disease stage and favorable survival in patient cohorts. This study uses functional modeling and omics approaches to identify IGFBP5 as a candidate mediator of anti-tumor growth mechanisms originating from tumor-neighboring mesenchymal stromal cells. Tumors of mesenchymal origin, such as RMS, are known for their heterogeneity, and this could potentially pose a limitation to the study. However, a clinical relevance is emphasized by consistent findings across patient cohorts. These insights pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies modulating activities of stromal cell subsets at primary and metastatic sites in RMS.",

These biochemically suspicious cases were genetically analyzed. We identified 723 Pompe cases with 283 different <i>GAA</i> alterations, and 98 variants have been unpublished so far. The most common variant was the splice variant c.-32-13T>G (IVS1). Looking at the IVS1-genotype, the majority was compound heterozygous (<i>n</i> = 169) and identified in late-onset cases (<i>n</i> = 162). Comparison of early- versus late-onset cases to evaluate whether certain genotypes correlate with the age of onset revealed that homozygosity was predominantly found in infantile (85.65%) and compound heterozygosity in late-onset (76.9%) cases. Analysis of homozygous cases revealed 61% nonsense variants in the early stages and 87% missense variants in the late stages. Mapping of disease-associated (homozygous) missense variants to functional GAA protein domains showed that missense variants were found throughout GAA, but we identified enrichment in the catalytic domain. A strict genotype-phenotype correlation cannot be established; nevertheless, a phenotypic implication of some <i>GAA</i> variants could be drawn (e.g., c.896T>C/p.L299P, c.2015G>A/p.R672Q, and c.-32-13T>G). The combined enzyme activity and genetic testing from DBS cards can reliably identify PD and significantly accelerate diagnosis. We identified new genetic variants that contribute to the spectrum of pathogenic variants of the <i>GAA</i> gene.",

          "abstract": "This study is aimed at investigating the clinical and genetic characteristics of 244 unrelated probands diagnosed with multiple osteochondromas (MO). The diagnosis of MO typically involves identifying multiple benign bone tumors known as osteochondromas (OCs) through imaging studies and physical examinations. However, cases with both OCs and enchondromas (ECs) may indicate the more rare condition metachondromatosis (MC), which is assumed to be distinct disease. Previous cohort studies of MO found heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) variants only in the <i>EXT1</i> or <i>EXT2</i> genes, with DNA diagnostic yield ranging from 78 to 95%. The <i>PTPN11</i> gene, which is causative for MC, was not previously investigated as a gene candidate for MO. In this study, we detected a total of 177 unique single nucleotide and copy number variants in three genes across 220 probands, consisting of 80 previously reported and 97 novel variants. Specifically, we identified five cases with OCs and no ECs as well as four cases with MC carrying LoF variants in the <i>PTPN11</i> gene and two additional cases with ECs harboring variants in the <i>EXT1/2</i> genes. These findings suggest a potential overlap between the MO and MC both phenotypically and genetically. These findings highlight the importance of expanding genetic testing beyond the <i>EXT1</i> and <i>EXT2</i> genes in MO cases, as other genes such as <i>PTPN11</i> may also be causative. This can improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment for individuals with MO and MC. It is essential to determine whether MO and MC represent distinct diseases or if they encompass a broader clinical spectrum.",

We introduce TRanscriptome ANalysis of StratifiEd CohorTs (TRANSECT), a bioinformatics application automating the stratification and subsequent differential expression analysis of cohort data to provide further insights into gene regulation. TRANSECT works by defining two groups within a cohort based on disparate expression of a gene or a gene set and subsequently compares the groups for differences in global expression. Akin to reverse genetics minus the inherent requirement of <i>in vitro</i> or <i>in vivo</i> perturbations, cell lines or model organisms and all the while working within natural physiological limits of expression, TRANSECT compiles information about global transcriptomic change and functional outcomes.

The invasive growth of cancer cells relates to membrane-damaging forces, but the relevance of plasma membrane repair machinery in ccRCC remains incompletely understood. Employing proteomics, analysis of scRNA-sequencing data, and multiplex imaging, we identified ANXA4 as selectively expressed in ccRCC, with distinct localization patterns at the plasma and nuclear membranes. Genetic titration studies demonstrated that reduced ANXA4 expression impairs membrane repair and invasive capabilities. Further segmentation analysis of ANXA4-low tumors showed a distinct composition of the tumor microenvironment, with increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and acellular extracellular matrix deposition. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated alterations in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and immune signaling signatures in ANXA4-low tumors. Transcription factor enrichment analysis identified ELF3 as a regulator of invasive properties. Our integrative approach uncovered multiple roles for ANXA4 in modulating membrane repair, transcriptional regulation, and shaping the ccRCC tumor microenvironment composition.",

Predictions estimate a rise to 2.5\u00a0million cases by 2035, with CRC being the fourth deadliest cancer due to delayed diagnosis and the scarcity of effective treatment options. Over 60% of CRC cases involve MAPK-activated signal pathways, particularly driven by RAS oncogene mutations, which hinder treatment responses, making them 'undruggable.' This study conducts a two-sample Mendelian randomization protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) analysis to investigate the causal association between plasma proteins and MAPK-activated CRCs. The study indicates that four plasma proteins-MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence B (MICB), complement C4A, C4B, and interleukin-21 (IL-21) are associated with an increased risk of MAPK-activated CRCs. These findings highlight the possibility of utilizing plasma proteins as therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers to advance the fight against CRCs, indicating promising results for more effective interventions. To ascertain and expand upon these discoveries, further research is imperative to fully harness the potential of these discoveries.",

However, mechanisms underlying the development of VHL mutation-independent ccRCC are unclear. Here we provide evidence that the disrupted Hippo-YAP signaling contributes to the development of ccRCC independent of VHL alteration. We found that YAP1 and its primary target genes are frequently upregulated in ccRCC and the upregulation of these genes is associated with unfavorable patient outcomes. Research results derived from our in vitro and in vivo experimental models demonstrated that, under normoxic conditions, hyperactivated YAP1 drives the expression of FGFs to stimulate the proliferation of tumor and tumor-associated endothelial cells in an autocrine/paracrine manner. When rapidly growing cancer cells create a hypoxic environment, hyperactivated YAP1 in cancer cells induces the production of VEGF, which promotes the angiogenesis of tumor-associated endothelial cells, leading to improved tumor microenvironment and continuous tumor growth. Our study indicates that hyperactivated YAP1 is essential for maintaining ccRCC progression, and targeting the dual role of hyperactivated YAP1 represents a novel strategy to improve renal carcinoma therapy.",

We found that inhibiting USP7 with the selective ubiquitin-specific protease 7 inhibitor (USP7i) FT671 inhibited cell proliferation in NRAS-mutant melanoma cell lines. In addition, we identified and validated that knockout of TP53BP1, TP53, or CDKN1A conferred resistance to FT671, suggesting that the activation of a functional p53 signaling pathway is essential for the efficacy of USP7i. In Nras-mutant melanoma isograft models, FT671 treatment delayed tumor growth. Moreover, the combinatorial treatment with FT671 and MAPK/(extracellular signal-regulated kinase) kinase 1/2 inhibitor was synergistic and induced pyroptosis in vitro. In immunocompetent mice, the combined treatment profoundly suppressed tumor growth, prolonged survival, and enhanced intratumoral immune cell infiltration, particularly increasing the ratios of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and mature dendritic cells, indicative of activated antitumor immunity. Notably, the triple combination of USP7i, MAPK/(extracellular signal-regulated kinase) kinase 1/2 inhibitor, and anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in durable tumor regression, with effects persisting beyond 80 days after treatment cessation. These findings establish USP7i + MAPK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) kinase 1/2 inhibitor as a promising strategy for targeting NRAS, an 'undruggable' mutation in melanoma, and provide a strong rationale for the clinical development of USP7i plus MAPK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) kinase 1/2 inhibitor as an adjuvant therapy to enhance anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma.",

Increasing evidence suggests that \u03b3\u03b4T cells play distinct roles in different cancers. However, the impact of \u03b3\u03b4T cells in breast cancer remains controversial. In this study, we investigated the role of \u03b3\u03b4T cells in breast cancer using a comprehensive approach, including bulk and single-cell sequencing, radiomics based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), genomic data, and immunohistochemistry. Single-cell RNA profiling was used to infer the potential lineage evolution of \u03b3\u03b4T cells and their interactions with other immune cells. Bulk RNA sequencing was included to uncover the heterogeneity in signaling pathways, as well as radiotherapy and immunotherapy responses, among patients with varying levels of \u03b3\u03b4T cell abundance. Genomic analysis was used to recognize the critical gene mutations with the infiltration of \u03b3\u03b4T cells. Immunohistochemistry was performed to validate the prognostic value of \u03b3\u03b4T cells in breast cancer patients. Lastly, radiomics was used to establish a correlation between the abundance of \u03b3\u03b4T cells and the features of MRI images. The \u03b3\u03b4T cell infiltration was closely associated with favorable prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) but not in other subtypes of breast cancer. \u03b3\u03b4T cells may exert antitumor effects through intrinsic lineage evolution or interact with antigen-presenting cells through ligand-receptor pairs. Patients with a high \u03b3\u03b4T cell abundance may benefit more from chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone than their combination. Additionally, patients with a high \u03b3\u03b4T cell abundance were more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. Finally, we established a radiomic model based on dynamic contrast-enhanced-MRI, which indicated the potential for estimating the \u03b3\u03b4T cell abundance for patients with TNBC.

Previously, we reported that the KPN mouse model resembles human CMS4. Strikingly, although tumor formation in this model is slow and limited, effective metastasis is observed. To understand this aggressive behavior, we compared two distinct in vitro KPN models, organoids and tumoroids. The organoid model only carries the original mutations, while the tumoroids are derived from in vivo grown tumors that underwent selection during development. Here, we reveal that tumoroids harbor endogenous WNT pathway activity, which can be driven by tankyrase activity and Cdx2 downregulation. Importantly, WNT pathway activation was heterogeneous in nature, subject to regulation and allowed for a mixture of WNT-driven and YAP-driven cells within tumoroids. This unique type of WNT pathway activation is not crucial for colonic tumor growth, but results in metastatic spreading. Intriguingly, these findings reflect a specific subset of aggressive human CMS4 cancers that display low CDX2 expression and lack of classical WNT pathway mutations, while having a higher tendency to metastasize. Together, these data propose a novel mechanism for WNT pathway activation that drives metastasis formation in aggressive CRC.",

Compared to liver and lung metastases, brain metastases present with increased co-occurrence of KRAS mutation and amplification. CRCs with concurrent KRAS mutation and amplification display significant metabolic reprogramming with upregulation of glycolysis, alongside upregulation of cell cycle pathways, including copy number gains of MDM2 and CDK4. Evolutionary modeling suggests early acquisition of many organotropic CIs enriched in both liver and brain metastases, while brain-enriched CIs preferentially emerge later.

The co-operation of ubiquitous alterations (TP53 and CDKN2A loss) and components of commonly deregulated pathways including squamous differentiation (SOX2), PI3K signalling (PTEN) and the oxidative stress response (KEAP1) is investigated by generating hBECs harbouring cumulative alterations. Our analyses confirms that SOX2-overexpression initiates early preinvasive LUSC stages, and co-operation with the oxidative stress response and PI3K pathways to drive more aggressive phenotypes, with expansion of cells expressing LUSC biomarkers and invasive properties. This cooperation is consistent with the classical LUSC subtype. Importantly, we connect pathway dysregulation with gene expression changes associated with cell-intrinsic processes and immunomodulation. Our approach constitutes a powerful system to model LUSC and unravel genotype-phenotype causations of clinical relevance.",

We aimed to understand how MAPKAPK2 (MK2) regulates HNSCC tumor cell migration and invasion, important first steps in cancer metastases. The TCGA database and HNSCC tissue microarrays were used to show that MK2 expression was associated with more advanced cancers and faster cancer recurrence rates. We observed that silencing of tumor MK2 in human cell lines (shRNA) caused a significant reduction in tumor cell migration-invasion in a complex HNSCC microphysiologic system used to recapitulate the tumor microenvironment. Murine cells (Ly2) with MK2 silenced (CRISPR-Cas9) also demonstrated reduced migration and invasion using 2D and 3D monoculture cell migration-invasions assays. Ly2 cells are orthotopic p16-negative murine metastatic cells that spontaneously metastasize, and we observed that MK2 inhibition via genetic (Cas9/CRISPR) or pharmacologic (PF-3644022) methods led to a significant reduction in the number of circulating tumor cells, fewer lymph node and lung metastases, and MK2 inhibited mice showed improved overall survival. Our findings suggest that HNSCC MK2 regulates tumor cell migration-invasion and may be a promising therapeutic target to reduce metastases.",

Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to identify P2RX4 expression in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and paracancer samples. P2RX4 was knocked in glioblastoma cell line (U251) and prostate cancer cell line (PC3), and its effects on cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion were investigated through cell counting kit-8 assay, flow cytometry, wound healing and trasnwell assays, respectively. P2RX4 expression was elevated in most cancers, which predicted poor overall survival and disease-free survival. Mutations in P2RX4 were predominantly found in Lymphoid Neoplasm Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (>\u20094%). P2RX4 expression showed a positive correlation with the infiltration levels of cancer-associated fibroblasts and CD8\u2009+\u2009cells in multiple tumor types. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that P2RX4 is closely related to autophagy, protein modification or intracellular trafficking. P2RX4 was highly expressed in LIHC compared to paracancerous tissues. Knockdown of P2RX4 suppressed cell viability, migration, invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis of U251 and PC3 cells.

In the past decade, the proteomics community has made significant strides in developing new technologies tailored for studying the surfaceome in all its complexity. In this review, we first dive into the unique characteristics and functions of the surfaceome, emphasizing the necessity for specialized labeling, enrichment, and proteomic approaches. An overview of surfaceomics methods is provided, detailing techniques to measure changes in protein expression and how this leads to novel target discovery. Next, we highlight advances in proximity labeling proteomics (PLP), showcasing how various enzymatic and photoaffinity proximity labeling techniques can map protein-protein interactions and membrane protein complexes on the cell surface. We then review the role of extracellular post-translational modifications, focusing on cell surface glycosylation, proteolytic remodeling, and the secretome. Finally, we discuss methods for identifying tumor-specific peptide MHC complexes and how they have shaped therapeutic development. This emerging field of neo-protein epitopes is constantly evolving, where targets are identified at the proteome level and encompass defined disease-associated PTMs, complexes, and dysregulated cellular and tissue locations. Given the functional importance of the surfaceome for biology and therapy, we view surfaceomics as a critical piece of this quest for neo-epitope target discovery.",

          "abstract": "An estimated 5%-10% of cancer results from an underlying genetic predisposition. For the majority of familial cases, the genes in question remain unknown, suggesting a critical need to identify new cancer predisposition genes. Members of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) family exist as trimeric holoenzymes and are vital negative regulators of multiple oncogenic pathways. PP2A inhibition by somatic mutation, loss of expression, and upregulation of its exogenous inhibitors in tumors has been well described. However, it remains unknown whether germline loss of any PP2A subunits results in a predisposition to cancer in humans. In this study, we identified 9 cancer patients with germline loss-of-function (LOF) variants in PPP2R1B (A\u03b2), the \u03b2 isoform of the PP2A scaffold subunit. All 4 patients for whom documentation was available also had a family history of cancer, including multiple indicators of hereditary cancer. Overexpression of these mutant forms of A\u03b2 resulted in truncated proteins that were rapidly turned over. Characterization of an additional missense germline A\u03b2 variant, R233C, which is also recurrently mutated at the somatic level, showed disruption of PP2A catalytic subunit binding, resulting in loss of phosphatase activity. An analysis of A\u03b2 expression among multiple breast cancer cohorts (the most highly represented cancer among the A\u03b2 germline patients) revealed that somatic, heterozygous loss of A\u03b2 was a frequent event in this disease, and decreased A\u03b2 expression correlated with shorter disease-free and overall survival. Furthermore, A\u03b2 levels were significantly lower in multiple histological subtypes of both in situ and malignant breast cancer compared with adjacent normal breast tissue, suggesting that A\u03b2 loss is an early event in breast cancer development. Together, these results highlight a role for A\u03b2 as a predisposition gene in breast cancer and potentially additional cancers.",

          "abstract": "Ovarian cancer remains one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies owing to its high recurrence rate and chemotherapeutic resistance. MYC is a well-known proto-oncogene that is frequently amplified in ovarian cancer and has been implicated in drug resistance. Previously, we established a new promoter-reporter system combined with a CRISPR activation library to identify unknown MYC regulators, and M1AP was identified as a novel MYC regulator. However, considering the insufficient explanation for the absence of guide RNA (gRNA) of MYC, this present study explored methods to prevent the gRNA of MYC itself from binding. This study first modified the promoter-reporter vector to improve its quality, then conducted CRISPR screening and analyzed candidate genes as MYC promoter regulators using next-generation sequencing in OVSAHO ovarian cancer cells. Eighty-six genes had\u2009\u2265\u20091000 reads, and Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis was performed on the cBioPortal of the Cancer Genomics database. Fourteen genes were identified as candidate MYC regulators with positive and significant correlations with MYC. Seven genes, including CYP4v2, ASPH, ANP32D, PCED1A, ABI1, FUZ, and HOOK2, demonstrated significantly higher luciferase activity than the control genes. Four genes, including ABI1, PCED1A, HOOK2, and CYP4v2, activated the MYC promoter, which showed over twofold higher activity than the control when overexpressed using a vector. In conclusion, four genes that activate MYC promoters were identified in an ovarian cancer cell line using the CRISPR library system with a modified promoter-reporter tool. These results will prove helpful in the development of novel treatment strategies for ovarian cancer.",

Most studies of Egfr signaling to date have been performed <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> or in tissue-specific mouse models of disease, which has limited insight into Egfr signaling patterns in healthy tissues. Here, we carried out integrated phosphoproteomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic analyses of signaling changes across various mouse tissues in response to short-term stimulation with the Egfr ligand Egf. We show how both baseline and Egf-stimulated signaling dynamics differ between tissues. Moreover, we propose how baseline phosphorylation and total protein levels may be associated with clinically relevant tissue-specific Egfr-associated phenotypes.

However, the impact of differential expression among ptgs2-positive tumours on CRC prognosis has not been well investigated. By sub-stratifying positive tumour expression, this study determined its potential influence on patients' outcomes. The Cancer Genome Atlas database was explored to determine CRC cases with RNA-Sequence (RNA-Seq) transcript data and matched clinicopathological data alongside gene copy number variation and methylation status. Descriptive, chi-square, Fisher exact, Linear-by-Linear associations, logistic and Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to determine proportions, associations, predictors and survival between ptgs2 and tumour parameters using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20. Two-tailed <i>p</i>-value <0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. There were 534 CRC classified predominantly as adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (86.3%) and mucinous carcinoma (12.4) histologically included in this study. Marker (ptgs2) expression ranged from 0.02 FPKM-131.89 FPKM, (Median 1.4 FPKM). The majority of the cases (53.4%) were diagnosed at an early stage and showed high ptgs2 RNA-Sequence (RNA-seq) expression in 51.5% (275/534). Significant associations were seen between ptgs2 expression and histological subtype (<i>p</i> < 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.013), pN2 stage (> 6 positive lymph nodes) (<i>p</i> = 0.011) and American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging stage (<i>p</i> = 0.028), and these all had lower ptgs2 expression. On regression analysis, histological differentiation emerged as a predictor of ptgs2 expression (Odds ratio 2.749, 95% confidence interval 1.479-5.108, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Also, gene methylation was associated with reduced ptgs2 expression. Overall survival was significantly inferior among individuals with low ptgs2 tumours (<i>p</i> = 0.018) while that for disease-free survival was non-significant (<i>p</i> = 0.327). CRCs with low ptgs2 transcripts are associated with poorer survival. This finding suggests a need for closer follow up and tailored adjuvant therapy for these patients.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer, a heterogeneous malignancy, comprises multiple subtypes and poses a substantial threat to women's health globally. Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT), administered prior to surgery, is integral to breast cancer treatment strategies. It aims to downsize tumors, optimize surgical outcomes, and evaluate tumor responsiveness to treatment. However, accurately predicting NAT efficacy remains challenging due to the disease's complexity and the diverse responses across different molecular subtypes. In this study, we harnessed multimodal data, including proteomic, genomic, MRI imaging, and clinical information, sourced from multiple cohorts such as I-SPY2, TCGA-BRCA, GSE161529, and METABRIC. Post data preprocessing, Lasso regression was utilized for feature extraction and selection. Five machine learning algorithms were employed to construct diagnostic models, with pathological complete response (pCR) as the predictive endpoint. Our results revealed that the multi-omics Ridge regression model achieved the optimal performance in predicting pCR, with an AUC of 0.917. Through unsupervised clustering using the R package MOVICS and nine clustering algorithms, we identified four distinct multimodal breast cancer subtypes associated with NAT. These subtypes exhibited significant differences in proteomic profiles, hallmark cancer gene sets, pathway activities, tumor immune microenvironments, transcription factor activities, and clinical characteristics. For instance, CS1 subtype, predominantly ER-positive, had a low pCR rate and poor response to chemotherapy drugs, while CS4 subtype, characterized by high immune infiltration, showed a better response to immunotherapy. At the single-cell level, we detected significant heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment among the four subtypes. Malignant cells in different subtypes displayed distinct copy number variations, differentiation levels, and evolutionary trajectories. Cell-cell communication analysis further highlighted differential interaction patterns among the subtypes, with implications for tumor progression and treatment response. Our multimodal diagnostic model and subtype analysis provide novel insights into predicting NAT efficacy in breast cancer. These findings hold promise for guiding personalized treatment strategies. Future research should focus on experimental validation, in-depth exploration of the underlying mechanisms, and extension of these methods to other cancers and treatment modalities.",

          "abstract": "Purine metabolism is a promising therapeutic target in cancer; however how cancer cells respond to purine shortage,particularly their adaptation and vulnerabilities, remains unclear. Using the recently developed purine shortage-inducing prodrug DRP-104 and genetic approaches, we investigated these responses in prostate, lung and glioma cancer models. We demonstrate that when de novo purine biosynthesis is compromised, cancer cells employ microtubules to assemble purinosomes, multi-protein complexes of de novo purine biosynthesis enzymes that enhance purine biosynthesis efficiency. While this process enables tumor cells to adapt to purine shortage stress, it also renders them more susceptible to the microtubule-stabilizing chemotherapeutic drug Docetaxel. Furthermore, we show that although cancer cells primarily rely on de novo purine biosynthesis, they also exploit Methylthioadenosine Phosphorylase (MTAP)-mediated purine salvage as a crucial alternative source of purine supply, especially under purine shortage stress. In support of this finding, combining DRP-104 with an MTAP inhibitor significantly enhances tumor suppression in prostate cancer (PCa) models in vivo. Finally, despite the resilience of the purine supply machinery, purine shortage-stressed tumor cells exhibit increased DNA damage and activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, which may contribute to impaired immunoevasion and provide a molecular basis of the previously observed DRP-104-induced anti-tumor immunity. Together, these findings reveal purinosome assembly and purine salvage as key mechanisms of cancer cell adaptation and resilience to purine shortage while identifying microtubules, MTAP, and immunoevasion deficits as therapeutic vulnerabilities.",

DiCE identifies candidate genes, refines them with an information gain filter, and reconstructs a condition-specific weighted PPI network. Using centrality measures, DiCE ranks genes based on expression shifts and network influence. Validated on prostate cancer datasets, DiCE identified genes over-represented in key pathways and cancer fitness genes, significantly correlating with disease-free survival (DFS), despite DFS not being used in selection.

          "abstract": "To investigate the relationships between pediatric neuroblastoma outcomes, tumor ploidy, and ethnicity, focusing on disparities in overall survival (OS) while also accounting for race and ethnicity. Clinical and tumor ploidy data for 63 Hispanic White, 561 non-Hispanic White, and 86 non-Hispanic Black patients were obtained from cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (TARGET [Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments], 2018). Kaplan Meier survival curves were analyzed using log-rank and Gehan-Breslow Wilcoxon tests. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CIs were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method. Associations between ethnicity and tumor ploidy were assessed using the chi-square test. Significant differences in overall survival (OS) were observed between White patients who self-identified as Hispanic and those who identified as non Hispanic, with Hispanic patients exhibiting worse outcomes. (P = .0076, HR = 1.907, 95% CI: 1.187-3.062). Median survival for Hispanic patients was 94 months but was undefined for non-Hispanic patients. Diploid tumors were associated with worse outcomes than hyperdiploid tumors were (P < .0001, HR = 2.291, 95% CI: 1.689-3.109). The chi square test revealed a significant association between ethnicity and tumor ploidy (\u03c72 = 4.220, P = .0400), with non-Hispanic patients having a higher proportion of hyperdiploid tumors (66.99%) than Hispanic patients (53.97%). Hispanic White patients with neuroblastoma had lower OS than did non-Hispanic White patients, partly due to the former having a higher proportion of diploid tumors. These findings highlight the importance of considering ethnicity and tumor ploidy in risk stratification and treatment strategies.",

This study investigates glycolysis- and lactate metabolism-related genes (GALMRGs) in HNSCC, focusing on their impact on prognosis, the tumor immune microenvironment, and their potential as therapeutic biomarkers. Analysis of data from the Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus identified 16 GALMRGs that were differentially expressed in HNSCC compared to normal tissues. Functional analysis revealed the involvement of lactate and pyruvate metabolism and HIF-1 signaling pathways. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified two module genes, CDKN3 and SLC2A1. Five key genes (CAV1, CDKN3, LDHA, MB, and PER2) were identified through univariate, multivariate, and LASSO regression analyses and used to construct a prognostic model. This model demonstrated strong predictive accuracy for overall survival, stratifying patients into high- and low-risk groups. Immune cell infiltration analysis showed a negative correlation between resting and activated mast cells, and low-risk patients had higher tumor mutational burden, suggesting a better response to immunotherapy. Consensus clustering classified HNSCC into two distinct molecular subtypes with differing expression of the key genes. This GALMRG-based prognostic model is a promising biomarker for predicting HNSCC outcomes and immunotherapy responses, providing valuable insights for personalized treatment strategies.",

A 71-year-old male presented with long-standing skin nodules and plaques including a growing and itchy black patch on his left heel. Pathological examination revealed neurofibroma in the nodules and malignant melanoma in the heel lesion. The diagnosis was neurofibromatosis type l with acromelanoma. Due to financial constraints, the patient refused surgical excision of the tumor and opted for conservative treatment with interferon injections. The patient is currently under follow-up observation.

We used bioinformatics tools to perform and visualize gene differential analysis on OSCC, analyse the expression of PRDXs family members in OSCC, and evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic monitoring value of PRDXs family members in OSCC patients. We utilized UALCAN, Cbioportal, and STRING websites to analyze the expression and gene mutations of the PRDXs family in pan-cancer, as well as the correlation of PRDXs family members. We used RT-qPCR technology to analyze the expression of PRDXs family members in OSCC cells. We used CCK8 technology to analyze the effect of PRDXs family members on the proliferation of OSCC cells. PRDX1, PRDX2, PRDX4 and PRDX5 are generally highly expressed in pan cancer, but PRDX6 is generally low expressed in pan-cancer. PRDX2 and PRDX6 have higher alteration frequency and the mutation of PRDXs family mainly focus on amplification in Pan-Cancer. PRDX1, PRDX4, and PRDX5 are highly expressed in OSCC tissue, while PRDX2 is low expressed in OSCC tissue. Similarly, PRDX1, PRDX4, and PRDX5 are also highly expressed in OSCC cells. Furthermore, PRDX1, PRDX4, and PRDX6 can promote the proliferation of OSCC cells. Except for PRDX6, all other members of the PRDXs family interact with TXN, and TXN plays a crucial role in the PRDXs family. PRDX4 has the highest diagnostic efficiency for OSCC, while PRDX2 and PRDX5 also have high diagnostic efficiency. The high expression of PRDX1 and PRDX6 suggests poor prognosis in OSCC patients, while the low expression of PRDX5 suggests poor prognosis in OSCC patients. PRDXs family members are expressed to varying degrees in OSCC and have different diagnostic and prognostic monitoring values for OSCC, which may provide a new direction for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of OSCC patients.",

Studies have suggested its potential role in the development of certain cancers. To evaluate CASP10 expression in normal and pan-cancer tissues, we integrated data from <i>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)</i>, GEO, <i>Human Protein Atlas (HPA)</i>, and UALCAN databases. The diagnostic and prognostic significance of CASP10 was analyzed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), Cox regression, and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Correlations of CASP10 with clinical parameters were assessed via the Wilcoxon test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and logistic regression analysis. Genomic variations were explored with cBioPortal, GSCALite database, and UALCAN databases. LinkedOmics database was used to detect the function of CASP10 in pan-cancer. Interactions between CASP10 and the Tumor Immune Microenvironment (TIME) were investigated using TISIDB, TIMER2, and TISCH databases. The GSCALite database was utilized to assess the sensitivity of CASP10 to small-molecule drugs. In addition, Western Blotting (WB) was employed to detect the expression of the CASP10 in our clinical Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC) and Stomach Adenocarcinoma (STAD) cohorts. The transcription and protein expression of CASP10 significantly differ across cancer types, marking it as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis. Its expression correlated with certain clinical characteristics such as histological types and Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) levels. CASP10 gene exhibited a 2% alteration frequency across pan-cancer patients, with significant SNV and CNV profiles, and decreased methylation levels. CASP10 was closely related to the Nuclear Factor-\u03baappa B (NF-\u03baB), TNF, cell cycle, and JAK-STAT signal pathways. CASP10 showed correlation with immune components in the tumor microenvironment, including lymphocytes, immune stimulators, immune inhibitors, MHC molecules, chemokines, receptors, and Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs). Importantly, CASP10 could predict the sensitivity of diverse anti-cancer drugs. Finally, WB analysis validated the overexpression of CASP10 in LIHC and STAD tissues. Our comprehensive bioinformatic analysis reveal the function of CASP10 on the diagnosis, prognosis, and progression of diverse cancer types.",

The analysis covered structural impacts, stability changes, regulatory effects, and oncogenic potential, focusing on conserved domains and protein-ligand interactions. <b>Results:</b> The analysis identified 84 deleterious variants, with 45 mapped to conserved regions like the Ig V-set domain essential for ligand-binding interactions. Stability analyses identified 78 destabilizing variants with significant protein instability (\u0394\u0394G values). Ten nsSNPs were identified as potential cancer drivers. Expression profiling showed differential <i>PDCD1</i> expression in tumor versus normal tissues, correlating with improved survival in skin melanoma but limited value in ovarian cancer. Regulatory SNPs disrupted miRNA-binding sites and transcriptional regulation, affecting <i>PDCD1</i> expression. STRING analysis revealed key PD-1 protein partners within immune pathways, including PD-L1 and PD-L2. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study highlights the significance of <i>PDCD1</i> nsSNPs as potential biomarkers for cancer susceptibility, advancing the understanding of PD-1 regulation.

Few effective treatments are available for the control of the disease and palliation of patients with metastatic gastric cancer. Although progress has been made in the elucidation of molecular pathways invoked in gastric carcinogenesis, this knowledge has not yet led to major breakthroughs, in contrast to several other types of cancer. The role of stem cell transcription factors SOX2 and CDX2 is of particular interest in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. The cohort of gastric adenocarcinomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was interrogated and two groups of gastric cancers, with CDX2 induction and SOX2 suppression on the one hand and with CDX2 induction and SOX2 maintained expression on the other hand were retained. The induction of expression of the two transcription factors was defined as a mRNA expression z score compared with normal samples above zero. The two groups were compared for clinical-pathologic and genomic differences. Among gastric cancers with up-regulated CDX2 mRNA, cancers with suppressed SOX2 mRNA were slightly more numerous (55.9%) than those with a maintained SOX2 expression. The SOX2 suppressed group had a higher prevalence of MSI high cancers (30.9% versus 10%) and of cases with high tumor mutation burden (35% versus 12.4%) than cancers with a SOX2 maintained expression, which presented more frequently high Chromosomal Instability (CIN). The group with SOX2 suppression had higher rates of mutations in many gastric cancer-associated genes such as epigenetic modifiers <i>ARID1A</i>, <i>KMT2D</i>, <i>KMT2C</i>, and <i>KMT2B</i>, as well as higher rates of mutations in genes encoding for receptor tyrosine kinases <i>ERBB4</i> and <i>FGFR1</i>. On the other hand, <i>TP53</i> mutations and amplifications in <i>MYC</i>, <i>ERBB2</i>, and <i>CCNE1</i> were more common in the group with a maintained expression of SOX2, approaching significance for <i>MYC</i>. Notable differences are present in the genomic landscape of CDX2-induced gastric cancer depending on the level of expression of SOX2 mRNA. Despite this, SOX2 mRNA expression levels were not prognostic.",

Recent studies have shown that OBSCN and the cytoskeletal protein it encodes, obscurin, play an important role in tumour progression. However, no studies have reported the role of OBSCN in BLCA. RNA sequencing and clinical data were downloaded from multiple public databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Gene Expression Omnibus. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on tissue microarrays including 80 BLCA patients from Shuguang Hospital. Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank test, univariate and multivariate COX regression were performed to evaluate the prognostic efficacy of OBSCN expression. In vitro experiments were conducted to determine the role of OBSCN deficiency in promoting BLCA progression. Pan-cancer tumour immune microenvironment (TIME) analysis was performed to explore the potential correlation between OBSCN deficiency and immune evasion. Pan-cancers and single-cell sequencing analysis revealed that the expression level and proportion of OBSCN was significantly decreased in BLCA cells compared to normal urothelium. Survival curves showed that BLCA patients with low OBSCN expression had a worse prognosis, yet a better clinical response to PD-L1 ICIs. Gene set variation analysis and Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and immune-related processes were significantly enriched in BLCA samples with low OBSCN expression. In vitro experiments identified that OBSCN-deficient BLCA cells enhanced invasion, migration and EMT. Pan-cancer analysis of TIME revealed that neoantigen, tumor mutation burden, CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells and immune checkpoints were significantly negatively associated with OBSCN expression. IHC and Western blot assay identified that BLCA samples with low OBSCN expression had more CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration and higher PD-L1 expression. This study confirmed that BLCA patients with low OBSCN expression had a worse prognosis but a superior response to ICIs, providing a reference for individualised treatment of BLCA patients.",

Then, we investigated the relationship between VPS72 and immune infiltration in HCC using diverse data sources, including the TCGA and GEO databases, clinical specimens, and animal models. Our findings in the immunogenomic and TCGA-LIHC studies revealed significant enrichment of VPS72 among IRG in the altered group. Differential analysis and KEGG pathway analysis further highlighted the involvement of differentially expressed genes (DETs) in pathways related to the T cell receptor signaling pathway. Importantly, TIMER analysis suggested that low expression of VPS72 was associated with high infiltration of CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells in multiple publicly available HCC datasets. To validate these findings, we conducted in vivo experiments and observed higher CD8A expression in VPS72-knockdown tumors. Additionally, in our patient cohort, individuals with low VPS72 expression exhibited higher CD8A expression. Furthermore, we identified a co-expression subtype characterized by low VPS72 and high CD8A levels, which showed a more favorable disease-free survival outcome in HCC.

To investigate the specific roles of NCKAP1 in the immune regulation and tumor progression of renal cancer, the expression of NCKAP1 and genetic variations were analyzed across cancer types at different pathological stages via UALCAN and cBioPortal. Immune cell infiltration in renal cancer was also assessed by ssGSEA and single-cell gene expression data from the GEO. RNA sequencing of NCKAP1-overexpressing 769P cells further examined the impact of NCKAP1 on kidney cancer. Our pancancer analyses revealed a complex NCKAP1 expression profile across various cancer types, with reduced levels in renal cancer patients linked to patient prognosis. CIBERSORT and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed the expression patterns of NCKAP1 in different cell lineages in renal cancer and a significant correlation between NCKAP1 and immune cell infiltration in the kidney tumor microenvironment.

          "abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a haematological malignancy primarily affecting older adults, characterised by the proliferation of functionally impaired B lymphocytes with abnormal expression of CD5, a typical T cell marker. The current study investigates the expression of cytotoxicity-related receptors (CD16, CD56, CD57, CD69) and a checkpoint (LAG-3) on \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in CLL patients. Sixty-nine treatment-naive CLL patients and fourteen healthy controls were recruited. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the CLL patients had higher expressions of CD56 and LAG-3 and lower CD16 on their \u03b3\u03b4 T cells compared to the healthy controls. Subgroup analysis showed that ZAP-70-negative patients exhibited increased CD69, while CD38-negative patients showed higher CD16 expression. Additionally, CD16 expression was inversely correlated with serum LDH levels, a marker of disease progression. Bioinformatic analysis of the LAG-3 ligand mRNA in a CLL dataset indicated higher expression of <i>HLA-DQA2</i> and <i>HLA-DRB5</i> in patients with unmutated <i>IGVH</i>. Our findings highlight the altered expression of key cytotoxicity markers on \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in CLL, suggesting their potential role in disease progression and as a therapeutic target. In particular, the use of anti-LAG-3 antibodies seems promising.",

          "abstract": "The growth of breast tumors is driven and controlled by a subpopulation of cancer cells resembling adult stem cells, which are called cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). In breast cancer, the function and maintenance of CSCs are influenced by protein O-GlcNAcylation and the enzyme responsible for this post-translational modification, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). However, the mechanism of CSCs regulation by OGT and O-GlcNAc cycling in breast cancer is still unclear. Analysis of the proteome and O-GlcNAcome, revealed GATAD2B, a component of the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex, as a substrate regulated by OGT. Reducing GATAD2B genetically impairs mammosphere formation, decreases expression of self-renewal factors and CSCs population. O-GlcNAcylation of GATAD2B at the C-terminus protects GATAD2B from ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in breast cancer cells. We identify ITCH as a novel E3 ligase for GATAD2B and show that targeting ITCH genetically increases GATAD2B levels and increases CSCs phenotypes. Lastly, we show that overexpression of wild-type GATAD2B, but not the mutant lacking C-terminal O-GlcNAc sites, promotes mammosphere formation, expression of CSCs factors and drug resistance. Together, we identify a key role of GATAD2B and ITCH in regulating CSCs in breast cancer and GATAD2B O-GlcNAcylation as a mechanism regulating breast cancer stem-like populations and promoting chemoresistance.",

          "abstract": "The nuanced roles of neuropilin (NRP) isoforms, NRP1 and NRP2, have attracted considerable scientific interest regarding cancer progression. Their differential expressions across various cancer types are specific to NRP isoforms which are shown in a cancer type-dependent manner. It accounts for the different mechanisms involved, driven by a co-expression of gene-sets associated with overexpressed <i>NRP1</i> or <i>NRP2</i>. Their different expressions on tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) with disparate markers are associated with the heterogenous tumour microenvironment (TME) through their plasticity and pro-tumorigenic activities. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses were performed on tumours from clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) which exhibit the highest expressions of NRP1 and NRP2, respectively. Datasets were processed using established bioinformatics pipelines, including clustering algorithms, to determine cellular heterogeneity and quantify NRP isoform expression within distinct macrophage populations. Using differential gene expression analysis (DEGA) alongside co-enrichment studies, we explored gene-sets associated with NRP1 or NRP2 overexpression in TAMs. Our analysis revealed a marked upregulation of <i>NRP1</i> in TAMs isolated from ccRCC and elevated <i>NRP2</i> expression in SKCM-derived TAMs. Both <i>NRP1<sup>+</sup></i> and <i>NRP2<sup>+</sup></i> macrophages showed an M2-like polarisation characterised by immune suppression and extracellular matrix degradation. Coupled with the previously uncharacterised <i>NRP isoform specific</i>- subpopulations within these cancers identified by DEGA, co-enrichment analyses demonstrated that the upregulation of gene-sets associated with <i>NRP1</i> is associated with angiogenesis and tumour progression through VEGF signalling, while gene-sets with <i>NRP2</i> showed dual functionality in the TME-dependent manner. Their distinct roles in regulating macrophage plasticity, tumour invasion, and metastasis were highlighted. These findings underscore distinct isoform-specific mechanisms by which NRP1 and NRP2 contribute to TAM-mediated cancer progression. This study aims to establish a foundation for future research, leading to biological experiments with focused gene-sets derived from our findings. This approach can contribute to the development of immunomodulatory strategies targeting specific NRP isoforms in macrophages, tailored to individual cancer types and abnormal expressions of those gene markers, potentially offering a more effective therapeutic approach compared to broad-spectrum <i>NRP</i> inhibition strategies.",

We analyze at the single-cell resolution the cellular landscape alterations during cancer initiation and progression. Our data indicate that the hyperactivated YAP1, via manipulating multiple signaling pathways, induces epithelial cell transformation, MDSC (Myeloid-derived suppressor cells) accumulation, and pRCC development. Interestingly, we find that depletion of MDSC blocks YAP1-induced kidney overgrowth and tumorigenesis. Inhibiting YAP1 activity with MGH-CP1, a recently developed TEAD inhibitor, impedes MDSC accumulation and suppresses tumor development.

Nevertheless, the precise biological functions and clinical implications of CBC in cancer remain ambiguous, necessitating further investigation for clarification. The present study utilized the cBioPortal database to investigate the genetic alterations of nuclear cap binding protein subunit 2 (NCBP2) in pan-cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and online web tools were employed to analyze the correlation between NCBP2 and prognosis, genome instability, immune infiltration, immune response, cancer stemness, and chemotherapeutic efficacy in pan-cancer. Furthermore, the expression of NCBP2 was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and functional analysis at the single-cell level was conducted using the CancerSEA database. <i>NCBP2</i> exhibited distinct genetic alterations in pan-cancer with an increased expression in 24/32, while decreased expression in 3/32, types of cancers. IHC confirmed the aberrant expression of NCBP2 in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP) and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). NCBP2 was correlated with overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free survival (PFS) in various cancers. Importantly, it was identified as a risk factor for OS, DSS and PFS in PAAD and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that elevated NCBP2 was linked to immune and proliferation related pathways across multiple cancer types. Furthermore, a negative association between NCBP2 and stromal score, immune score, and ESTIMATE score was detected, and a positive correlation was observed between NCBP2 and diverse immune cells as well as stemness-indexes in the majority of cancer types. Drug sensitivity analysis revealed that drugs associated with NCBP2 primarily targeted DNA replication, chromatin histone methylation, ABL signaling, cell cycle, and PI3K signaling. Additionally, an examination at the single-cell level indicated that NCBP2 was positively correlated with cell cycle progression, DNA damage, DNA repair, invasion, and stemness in most cancer types, while negatively correlated with apoptosis, inflammation, and hypoxia in certain cancers. In this study, we revealed the correlation of NCBP2 with prognosis, microenvironment and stemness, indicating that NCBP2 might be a potential therapeutic target for more effective and personalized therapy strategies in pan-cancer.",

Methotrexate (MTX) may be beneficial for treating breast cancer; however, high doses and prolonged use can cause drug resistance. Although certain citrus flavonoids-nobiletin, sinensetin, tangeretin, hesperidin, hesperetin, and naringenin-may overcome resistance to chemotherapy, no study has investigated MTX resistance. This study investigated the potential of natural chemicals, specifically nobiletin and sinensetin, to overcome MTX resistance in breast cancer cells using MTX-resistant MCF-7 (MCF-7/MTX) and MCF-7 cells. Protein targets of citrus flavonoids were identified from multiple databases and were collected\u00a0using Venny 2.1.

Inhibitors of the master mitotic kinase PLK1 have emerged as promising therapeutics, demonstrating efficacy in an undefined subset of patients with AML. However, the clinical success of PLK1 inhibitors remains hindered by a lack of predictive biomarkers. The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, a tumor-suppressive network comprised of at least 22 genes, is frequently mutated in sporadic AML. In this study, we demonstrate that FA pathway disruption sensitizes AML cells to PLK1 inhibition. Mechanistically, we identify novel interactions between PLK1 and both FANCA and FANCD2 at mitotic centromeres. We demonstrate that PLK1 inhibition impairs recruitment of FANCD2 to mitotic centromeres, induces damage to mitotic chromosomes, and triggers mitotic collapse in FANCA-deficient cells. Our findings indicate that PLK1 inhibition targets mitotic vulnerabilities specific to FA pathway\u2013deficient cells and implicate FA pathway mutations as potential biomarkers for the identification of patients likely to benefit from PLK1 inhibitors. This work demonstrates that FA pathway mutations, which are frequently observed in sporadic AML, induce hypersensitivity to PLK1 inhibition, providing rationale for a novel synthetic lethal therapeutic strategy for this patient population.",

Here, we investigated the RNA helicase Senataxin (SETX), an enzyme that resolves RNA-DNA hybrids and R-loops, to address its role in preventing RS by oncogenic Myc. Upon Myc activation, silencing of SETX led to selective engagement of the DNA damage response (DDR) and robust cytotoxicity. Pharmacological dissection of the upstream kinases regulating the DDR uncovered a protective role of the ATR pathway, that once inhibited, boosted SETX driven-DDR. While SETX loss did not lead to a genome-wide increase of R-loops, mechanistic analyses revealed enhanced R-loops localized at DDR-foci and newly replicated genomic loci, compatible with a selective role of SETX in resolving RNA-DNA hybrids to alleviate Myc-induced RS. Genome-wide mapping of DNA double-strand breaks confirmed that SETX silencing exacerbated DNA damage at transcription-replication conflict (TRC) regions at early replicated sites. We propose that SETX prevents Myc-induced TRCs by resolving transcription-associated R-loops that encounter the replisome. The identification of SETX as a genetic liability of oncogenic Myc opens up new therapeutic options against aggressive Myc-driven tumors.",

          "abstract": "Several studies have shown that Parkinson's disease causative gene products, including \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), display tight links with the tumor suppressor p53. The purpose of this study is to determine the implication of \u03b1-syn in glioblastoma development and elucidate how it elicits a tumor suppressor function. We show that the expression of \u03b1-syn, a TP53 transcriptional target and a key molecular player in Parkinson's disease, is detected in 1p/19q-codeleted and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant oligodendroglioma and in IDH-wild-type glioblastoma, while reduced in glioblastoma biopsies, corroborating the link of \u03b1-syn expression with a better prognosis among all glioma patients. Accordingly, protein expression is drastically reduced in oligodendrogliomas and glioblastoma biopsies. This could be accounted for by a reduction of p53 transcriptional activity in these samples. Interestingly, genetic manipulation of p53 in glioblastoma cells and in mouse brain shows that p53 up-regulates \u03b1-synuclein, a phenotype fully abolished by the prominent p53 hot spot mutation R175H. Downstream to its p53-linked control, \u03b1-syn lowers cyclin D1 protein and mRNA levels and reduces glioblastoma cells proliferation in a cyclin D1-dependent-manner. Further, in temozolomide (TMZ)-resistant U87 cells, \u03b1-syn reduces O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression and rescues drug sensitivity by a mechanism implying its transcriptional activation by X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), an effector of the UPR response. Furthermore, \u03b1-syn lowers MGMT and cyclin D1 (CCDN1) expressions and reduces tumor development in allografted mice. Overall, our data reveals a new role of \u03b1-syn as an oligodendroglioma biomarker and as a glioblastoma tumor suppressor capable of either potentiate TMZ effect or avoid TMZ-associated resistance.",

          "abstract": "Recently, interleukin 17 (IL-17) has been found to play a critical role in the development of breast cancer. However, its prognostic significance in invasive breast cancer (IBC) remains unclear. This study aims to determine the role of IL-17-related signatures in IBC to identify novel therapeutic options. IBC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) were used to identify IL-17-related prognostic genes. A predictive model was developed using TCGA data and validated using METABRIC data. The relationship between IL-17 scores and immune landscape, chemotherapy drug sensitivity [half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)], and immune checkpoint gene expression was analyzed. The quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to validate key gene expression in breast tumor and normal tissue samples. The predictive model identified core IL-17-related prognostic genes and successfully estimated the prognosis of IBC patients. The model's validity was confirmed using METABRIC data. Patients with high IL-17 scores had worse overall survival (OS) compared to those with low IL-17 scores. Low IL-17 scores were associated with higher immune checkpoint gene expression and predicted enhanced responses to cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapies. Patients with low IL-17 scores exhibited a higher abundance of immune microenvironment components. Furthermore, qRT-PCR confirmed the lower expression of <i>OR51E1, NDRG2, RGS2</i>, and <i>TSPAN7</i> in breast tumors compared to normal tissue. IL-17-related signatures are promising biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of IBC patients. These findings suggest that IL-17-related markers could be used to guide individualized therapeutic strategies, potentially improving outcomes for IBC patients.",

The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family plays vital roles in the tumorigenesis and development of colorectal cancer. The expression, prognostic value, and immune function of the STAT family are becoming much more clearly. Our study collected data from several public data portals such as TCGA (644 samples) and GTEx database (308 samples) and clinical samples (30 samples, China). Then we systematically assessed the expression level and prognostic value of the STAT family in colorectal cancer samples. Moreover, the immune function and immune infiltration levels of prognosis-related STAT members were explored via single cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics technology data. Several useful portals and tools have been utilized such as CancerSEA and TISIDB in single-cell analysis, CBio Cancer Genomics in multidimensional alterations, MethSurv in DNA methylation, and related R packages. Our study found that STAT3 and STAT5B were significantly lower in colorectal cancer via multi-omics (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Higher STAT3 and STAT5B level were correlated with better future outcome. Nomograms were developed to predict the distal survival time (C-index\u2009=\u20090.724). The functions of STAT3 and STAT5B are associated with inflammation, the JAK/STAT pathway and the immune response. The major cell types of colorectal cancer were CD4Tconv, CD8T, CD8Tex, Tprolif, Treg and STAT3 and STAT5B widely expressed in these cells. STAT3 and STAT5B both correlated with CD244 and KDR for immune checkpoints. STAT3 and STAT5B are downregulated in colorectal cancer and have great potential as prognostic biomarkers and novel immunotherapy targets.",

Here, we developed an interpretable deep learning (DL) model that predicts the Angioscore directly from ubiquitous histopathology slides yielding a visual vascular network (H&E DL Angio). H&E DL Angio achieves a strong correlation with the Angioscore across multiple cohorts (spearman correlations of 0.77 and 0.73). Using this approach, we found that angiogenesis inversely correlates with grade and stage and is associated with\u00a0driver mutation status.

          "abstract": "Resistance to both naturally occurring anti-cancer immunity and to immunotherapy is common in patients with aggressive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recent studies indicate a role of loss of the HLA class-I antigen presentation machinery (APM) protein \u03b2-2-microglobulin in acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockers. However, the mechanisms, functional consequences and therapeutic potential of APM defects in NSCLC remain poorly understood. Using multiplexed immunofluorescence, we spatially mapped CD8<sup>+</sup> effector Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) and the APM components TAP1 and TAP2 in 819 baseline/pre-treatment NSCLCs from patients treated with and without PD-1 axis blockers in 4 independent cohorts. The impact of TAP1/2 silencing in lung cancer cells using siRNAs and CRISPR/Cas9 was studied using transcriptomic analysis, phosphoprotein arrays, ATAC-sequencing, measurement of surface HLA-peptide complexes and in vitro tumor-antigen specific T-cell killing. We established autologous co-cultures of tumor and immune cells from primary human NSCLCs to study the functional impact of IL4R\u03b1 and/or PD-1 blockade using monoclonal antibodies. A high-throughput drug screen supported the identification of compounds able to increase TAP2 expression\u00a0in NSCLC cells. We identified cancer\u00a0cell selective TAP2 protein downregulation in 42.4% of treatment na\u00efve NSCLCs associated with reduced sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockers. TAP1 downregulation occurred in 24.4% of lung tumors without survival impact. Silencing of TAP2 in lung cancer\u00a0cells altered key intracellular immunomodulatory pathways, limited sensitivity to proinflammatory cytokines, reduced the levels of surface peptide-HLA complexes and protected malignant cells from tumor\u00a0antigen-specific T-cell killing via SOCS1 upregulation. TAP2 loss in human NSCLCs was associated with reduced TAP2 promoter chromatin accessibility and elevated IL-4 IL-4\u00a0expression. Treatment with IL-4 reduced TAP2 levels and the chromatin accessibility of the TAP2 gene promoter in NSCLC cells and reproduced all the functional consequences of TAP2 loss. In intact human NSCLC, IL-4\u00a0IL-4 transcripts were detected in intratumoral myeloid cells and IL-4R\u03b1 blockade increased human NSCLC cell killing by autologous TILs. Epigenetic modulators and other drugs with known anti-cancer activity increased TAP2 expression and its function in lung cancer\u00a0cells. Our study reveals previously unrecognized functions of TAP2 beyond antigen presentation and establishes a reversible multi-cellular axis mediating adaptive immune evasion and immunotherapy resistance with clinical potential.",

This study investigates TIPRL expression across multiple cancers and its associations with survival, genetic alterations, immune infiltration, and functional pathways, providing insights into TIPRL's role as a potential prognostic and therapeutic target. TIPRL expression and prognostic significance across tumor types were analyzed using TCGA_GTEx and CPTAC data in R software and platforms like GEPIA2 and UALCAN. Genetic alterations and 3D structures were evaluated through cBioPortal. Associations with RNA modifications, immune checkpoints, immune cell infiltration, TMB, MSI, HRD, and enriched pathways were assessed via R and STRING databases, employing survival analysis, ssGSEA, and enrichment analyses. TIPRL expression was elevated in most cancers, with significant stage-specific associations observed in KICH, KIRP, and LUSC. High TIPRL expression correlated with worse overall survival in ACC, BRCA, HNSC, KICH, LIHC, and MESO, suggesting its role in prognosis. Genetic analysis identified amplifications as the main alteration, with varied clinical relevance across cancers. RNA modifications in TIPRL, particularly m1A, m5C, and m6A, suggested potential regulatory mechanisms. Immune infiltration analysis revealed TIPRL's varied correlations with immune cell types and immune scores, differing by cancer type. TIPRL also positively correlated with TMB, MSI, and HRD in several cancers, indicating its association with genomic instability. Enrichment analyses highlighted TIPRL's involvement in processes like oxidative phosphorylation and autophagy, underscoring its influence in tumorigenesis. These findings establish TIPRL as a significant biomarker in cancer progression and immune regulation, warranting further exploration into its therapeutic implications across diverse tumor types.",

Nevertheless, translational strategies to trigger collaboration of NK cells and macrophages to initiate sufficient anti-tumor cytoxicity remain scarce and are urgently needed. In this study, TCGA datasets was used to confirm the prognosis value of the expression level of NLR family pyrin domain containing 4 (NLRP4) in NSCLC and the tumor tissues microarray was used to further check its clinical-relevance at protein-level. Subsequently, a tumor cell line with stable NLRP4 overexpression was established and subcutaneous tumor models in C57BL/6J mice were used to validate the anti-tumor characteristics of NLRP4. After analyzing the tumor microenvironment using flow cytometry and multiplex immunofluorescence, we further validated our findings through co-culture transwell assays and TCGA analysis. Utilizing bulk-RNA sequencing, proteomics, and mass spectrometry of mouse tumor tissues, we innovatively identified the downstream pathways of NLRP4 and verified them through co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and Western blot (WB) experiments. NLRP4 could trigger a distinct anti-tumor ecosystem organized by TIGIT<sup>+</sup>TNFA<sup>+</sup> NK and iNOS<sup>+</sup> M1 in lung cancer, discovered in TCGA analysis and verified in murine model. NLRP4-eco exerted tumor-suppression capacity through chemokine reprogramming including CCL5 and CXCL2. Meanwhile, the cytoxicity of NK could be facilitated by iNOS<sup>+</sup>M1. Mechanistically, NLRP4 stimulated PI3K/Akt-NF-kB axis through suppression of the activity of PP2A. Besides, knockdown of CCL5 and blockade of CXCL2-CXCR2 axis abolished chemotaxis of TIGIT<sup>+</sup>TNFA<sup>+</sup> NK and iNOS<sup>+</sup> M1 respectively, as well as for LB-100, a PP2A inhibitor. Altogether, we delineated NLRP4's unexplored facets and discovered an NLRP4-driven anti-tumor ecosystem composed of TIGIT<sup>+</sup>TNFA<sup>+</sup> NK and iNOS<sup>+</sup> M1. Finally, targeting PP2A by its inhibitor successfully mimicked the anti-tumor capacity of the overexpression of NLRP4.",

A notable correlation exists between decreased let-7 microRNA levels and the overexpression of Lin28A and Lin28B, particularly in breast cancer cases with poor prognoses. Dysregulation of Wnt signaling significantly contributes to the upregulation of Lin28A and Lin28B in breast cancer. Both Lin28A and Lin28B operate from different cellular compartments to inhibit the biogenesis of let-7 microRNAs, which are essential for the post-transcriptional regulation of genes involved in key cellular functions such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Decreased expression of let-7 microRNAs leads to the overexpression of oncogenes such as K-ras, C-myc, and SOX-2 in breast cancer. Overexpression of Lin28A associated with reduced let-7 microRNA levels is observed in estrogen receptor positive, estrogen receptor negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancers, whereas Lin28B overexpression with reduced let-7 microRNA levels occurs specifically in triple negative breast cancer. This review aims to dissect the molecular interplay between Lin28A, Lin28B, and let-7 microRNAs, elucidating their roles in breast carcinogenesis, metastasis, and the development of resistance to conventional treatments like radiation and chemotherapy. Additionally, the review addresses potential therapeutic avenues offered by let-7 microRNAs or their mimics, as well as Lin28A and Lin28B inhibitors, in the treatment of breast cancer.",

          "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) stands as a formidable adversary among women, remaining a leading cause of cancer-related mortality owing to its aggressive and invasive nature. Investigating prognostic markers intricately linked to OC's molecular pathogenesis represents a critical avenue for enhancing patient outcomes and survival prospects. In this comprehensive study, we embarked on a bioinformatics journey, leveraging the vast repository of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from OC patients available within the TCGA database. Our overarching goal was to unearth the genetic underpinnings of OC, shedding light on potential prognostic markers that could significantly impact clinical decision-making and patient care. Our meticulous analysis led to the discovery of five mutated genes-APOB, BRCA1, COL6A3, LRP1, and LRP1B-engaged in the intricate world of lipid metabolism. These genes, previously unexplored in the context of OC, emerged as prominent figures in our investigation, showcasing their potential roles in OC progression. The intricate interplay between lipid metabolism and cancer development has garnered considerable attention in recent years, and our findings underscore the relevance of these genes in the context of OC. To fortify our discoveries, we delved into the realm of survival analysis, a pivotal component of our investigation. The results yielded compelling evidence of significant correlations between patient survival and the expression levels of the aforementioned genes. This critical insight underscores the potential utility of these genes as prognostic markers, illuminating a path toward more personalized and effective approaches to patient care. Our study represents a multifaceted approach to unraveling the complex molecular pathogenesis of OC. By harnessing the power of high-throughput data mining, we uncovered genetic insights that may reshape our understanding of this formidable disease. We complemented these findings with advanced techniques such as RT-qPCR and Western blot, further dissecting the intricacies of OC's molecular landscape. This holistic approach not only deepens our understanding but also provides essential bioinformatics information that holds promise in assessing patient prognosis. In summary, our study represents a significant stride in the quest to decode the molecular intricacies of ovarian cancer. Our findings spotlight the potential prognostic significance of APOB, BRCA1, COL6A3, LRP1, and LRP1B, inviting further exploration into their roles in OC progression. Ultimately, our research carries the potential to shape the future of OC management, offering a glimpse into a more personalized and effective approach to patient care.",

          "abstract": "Originally identified for its involvement in bone remodeling, accumulating data emerged in the past years indicating that receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB ligand (RANKL) actually acts as a multifunctional soluble molecule that influences various physiological and pathological processes. Regarding its role in carcinogenesis, while direct effects on tumor cell behavior have been precisely characterized, the impact of the RANKL/RANK system (and its inhibition) on the intratumoral immune landscape remains unclear. After various in silico/in situ/in vitro analyses, the immunotherapeutic efficacy of RANKL blockade (alone and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)) or doxorubicin/paclitaxel-based chemotherapy) was investigated using different syngeneic mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer (4T1, 67NR and E0771). Isolated from retrieved tumors, 14 immune cell (sub)populations, along with the activation status of antigen-presenting cells, were thoroughly analyzed in each condition. Finally, the impact of RANKL on the functionality of both dendritic cells (DC) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) was determined. A drastic tumor growth inhibition was reproductively observed following RANKL inhibition. Strikingly, this antitumor activity was not detected in immunocompromised mice, demonstrating its dependence on the adaptive immune responses and justifying the diverse enriched signatures linked to immune cell regulation/differentiation detected in RANKL<sup>high</sup>-expressing human neoplasms. Interestingly, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (but not PD-1 checkpoint inhibition) potentiated the anticancer effects of RANKL blockade by priming effector T cells and increasing their infiltration within the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we highlighted that RANKL indirectly promotes regulatory T cell differentiation and suppressive function by inhibiting the mTOR signaling pathway on antigen-presenting cells. Taken together, this study provides insight into the role of RANKL/RANK axis in immune tolerance, demonstrates the significant impact of RANKL-dependent impairment of T cell-DC/pDC crosstalk on tumor development and, ultimately, supports that this ligand could be an interesting actionable target for cancer immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most lethal of all gynecologic malignancies in which the majority of patients eventually develop chemoresistant recurrent disease. Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme canonically known for its involvement in neurodegeneration, but recently has been shown to play a key role in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, UCHL1 has garnered attention across a multitude of cancer subtypes as it has the ability to be targeted through small molecule inhibition. Therefore, the goal of this present study was to elucidate mechanistic consequences of small molecule UCHL1 inhibition in HGSOC. Comparative label-free proteomic analysis of HGSOC cell line, OVCAR8 revealed prominent changes in cell metabolism proteins upon treatment with UCHL1 small molecule inhibitor, LDN-57444. Further validation via Western blot analysis revealed that changes in cell metabolism proteins differed in matched chemosensitive versus chemoresistant HGSOC cells. Finally, cell viability analysis demonstrated that a combinatorial carboplatin and LDN-57444 blockade produced a promotion or conversely, inhibition of cell death, in chemoresistant, and chemosensitve HGSOC cells, respectively. This phenomenon was further corroborated by respective differences in activation levels of common tumor cell growth pathways STAT3, MAPK/ERK, and AKT in chemoresistant versus chemosensitive HGSOC cells. Overall, this investigation established that pharmacologic targeting of UCHL1 produces differential effects according to HGSOC chemosensitivity status.",

In this study, we performed a multi-omics clustering analysis using the Cancer Integration via MultIkernel LeaRning (CIMLR) method on a large BC dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify key prognostic biomarkers. We identified three genes-<i>LMO1</i>, <i>PRAME</i>, and <i>RSPO2</i>-that were significantly associated with poor prognosis in both the TCGA dataset and an additional dataset comprising 146 metastatic BC patients. Patients' stratification based on the expression of these three genes revealed distinct subtypes with markedly different overall survival (OS) outcomes. Further validation using almost 2000 BC patients' data from the METABRIC dataset and RNA sequencing data from therapy-resistant cell lines confirmed the upregulation of <i>LMO1</i> and <i>PRAME</i>, respectively, in patients with worse prognosis and in resistant cells, also suggesting their potential role in drug resistance. Our findings highlight <i>LMO1</i> and <i>PRAME</i> as potential biomarkers for identifying high-risk BC patients and informing targeted treatment strategies. This study provides valuable insights into the multi-omics landscape of BC and underscores the importance of personalized therapeutic approaches based on molecular profiles.",

TAP2 plays a role in the progression of cancers, such as cervical, breast, and lung cancers. However, the relationship between TAP2 and cancer prognosis, immune cell infiltration, tumor microenvironment, and immunotherapy remains unexplored. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of TAP2 expression on its role in predicting tumor prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy. Bioinformatics analyses such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, single-cell, and Connectivity Map analyses were used to comprehensively assess TAP2-related genomic alterations, prognostic value, enrichment pathways, single-cell expression patterns, and potential targeting inhibitors. In addition, molecular docking techniques were used to simulate drug binding to TAP2. WB and RT-qPCR were used to detect differences in TAP2 expression in glioma cell lines. The U251MG cell line was established with TAP2 overexpression. The effects of elevated TAP2 expression on GBM cell function was evaluated using various assays, including the Transwell migration, scratch, and clonal formation assays. TAP2 exhibited aberrantly expression in tumor tissues with genomic alterations. TAP2 significantly correlates with poor prognosis across various cancers. It was also involved in immune-related pathways, immune infiltration, and immune checkpoint regulation, thereby influencing the tumor microenvironment and immune response to cancer. TAP2 was identified as a potential predictor of immunotherapy response and screened for potential targeted inhibitors for future therapeutic interventions. Our findings suggest that TAP2 may serve as a promising prognostic marker and immune target in human cancers, warranting further investigation into its role in tumor immunity.",

          "abstract": "Despite the progress of treatment in gastric cancer (GC), the overall outcomes remain poor in patients with advanced diseases, underscoring the urgency to develop more effective treatment strategies. BH3-mimetic drugs, which inhibit the pro-survival BCL2 family proteins, have demonstrated great therapeutic potential in cancer therapy. Although previous studies have implicated a role of targeting the cell survival pathway in GC, the contribution of different pro-survival BCL2 family proteins in promoting survival and mediating resistance to current standard therapies in GC remains unclear. A systematic study to elucidate the hierarchy of these proteins using clinically more relevant GC models is essential to identify the most effective therapeutic target(s) and rational combination strategies for improving GC therapy. Here, we provide evidence from both in vitro and in vivo studies using a broad panel of GC cell lines, tumoroids, and xenograft models to demonstrate that BCLXL and MCL1, but not other pro-survival BCL2 family proteins, are crucial for GC cells survival. While small molecular inhibitors of BCLXL or MCL1 exhibited some single-agent activity, their combination sufficed to cause maximum killing. However, due to the unsolved cardiotoxicity associated with direct MCL1 inhibitors, finding combinations of agents that indirectly target MCL1 and enable the reduction of doses of BCLXL inhibitors while maintaining their anti-neoplastic effects is potentially a feasible approach for the further development of these compounds. Importantly, inhibiting BCLXL synergized significantly with anti-mitotic and HER2-targeting drugs, leading to enhanced anti-tumour activity with tolerable toxicity in preclinical GC models. Mechanistically, anti-mitotic chemotherapies induced MCL1 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway mainly through FBXW7, whereas HER2-targeting drugs suppressed MCL1 transcription via the STAT3/SRF axis. Moreover, co-targeting STAT3 and BCLXL also exhibited synergistic killing, extending beyond HER2-amplified GC. Collectively, our results provide mechanistic rationale and pre-clinical evidence for co-targeting BCLXL and MCL1 (both directly and indirectly) in GC. (i) Gastric cancer cells rely on BCLXL and, to a lesser degree, on MCL1 for survival. The dual inhibition of BCLXL and MCL1 with small molecular inhibitors acts synergistically to kill GC cells, regardless of their TCGA molecular subtypes or the presence of poor prognostic markers. While the effect of S63845 is mediated by both BAX and BAK in most cases, BAX, rather than BAK, acts as the primary mediator of BCLXLi in GC cells. (ii) Inhibiting BCLXL significantly synergizes with anti-mitotic and HER2-targeting drugs, leading to enhanced anti-tumour activity with tolerable toxicity in preclinical GC models. Mechanistically, anti-mitotic chemotherapies induce MCL1 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway mainly through FBXW7, whereas HER2-targeting drugs suppress MCL1 transcription via the STAT3/SRF axis. The combination of the STAT3 inhibitor and BCLXL inhibitor also exhibits synergistic killing, extending beyond HER2-amplified GC.",

The aim of this study was to conduct a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis to elucidate the multifaceted roles of EXO1 in various malignancies. Leveraging public databases including TCGA, GTEx, HPA, cBioPortal, UALCAN, STRING, CancerSEA and TISIDB database, we examined EXO1's expression, diagnostic potential, prognostic significance, mutational characteristics, functional roles, and immunological effects across different cancer types. EXO1 was found to be upregulated in multiple cancers, with significant diagnostic potential as indicated by high AUC values in ROC analyses. Elevated EXO1 expression correlated with adverse prognosis in several cancer types, including breast, lung, and pancreatic cancers. Epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation and mRNA modifications, were also associated with EXO1 expression. Enrichment analyses identified EXO1-related genes involved in DNA recombination, replication, and repair, with GSEA implicating EXO1 in cell cycle regulation and DNA processing pathways. Importantly, immunogenomic analyses revealed EXO1's significant role in modulating the tumor microenvironment, as it is associated with immune cell infiltration and cytokine expression, suggesting its involvement in tumor immunology and immune response regulation. These results implied that EXO1 as a significant biomarker with prognostic and diagnostic potential across various malignancies, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target and its involvement in immunomodulatory processes within the tumor microenvironment.",

Recent evidence has indicated that TRAP1 mutations are involved in several disorders, even though the structural basis for the impact of point mutations on TRAP1 functions has never been studied. By exploiting a modular structure-based framework and molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the effect of five TRAP1 mutations on its structure and stability. Each mutation differentially impacts long-range interactions, intra and inter-protomer dynamics and ATPase activity. Changes in these parameters influence TRAP1 functions, as revealed by their effects on the activity of the TRAP1 interactor succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). In keeping with this, TRAP1 point mutations affect the growth and migration of aggressive sarcoma cells, and alter sensitivity to a selective TRAP1 inhibitor. Our work provides new insights on the structure-activity relationship of TRAP1, identifying crucial amino acid residues that regulate TRAP1 proteostatic functions and pro-neoplastic activity.",

The expression of leptinR and adipoR1 were analysed in cohorts of renal cell cancer (n=391), cervical cancer (n=155), vulvar cancer (n=107), and endometrial cancer (n=90) by immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinicopathological parameters including survival times. Expression of leptinR was high in renal cell cancer (62.2%), vulvar carcinoma (50%), and endometrial cancer (80.5%). High expression was associated with favourable clinicopathological markers and longer overall survival times in renal cell and vulvar cancer. AdipoR1 was only weakly expressed in all four tumour entities and did not show significant associations with clinicopathological parameters or prognosis.

SLC25A35 belongs to the SLC25 family of mitochondrial carrier proteins. However, the role of SLC25A35 in mitochondrial metabolism reprogramming, development and progression in human cancers remains unclear. Here, we found that SLC25A35 markedly reprogramed mitochondrial metabolism, characterized by increased oxygen consumption rate and ATP production and decreased ROS level, via enhancing fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Meanwhile, SLC25A35 also enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis characterized by increased mitochondrial mass and DNA content. Mechanistic studies revealed that SLC25A35 facilitated FAO and mitochondrial biogenesis through upregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) via increasing acetyl-CoA-mediated acetylation of PGC-1\u03b1. Clinically, SLC25A35 was highly expressed in HCC and correlated with adverse patients' survival. Functionally, SLC25A35 promoted the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo, as well as the carcinogenesis in a DEN-induced HCC mice model. Moreover, we found that SLC25A35 upregulation is caused, at least in part, by decreased miR-663a in HCC cells. Together, our results suggest a crucial oncogenic role of SLC25A35 in HCC by reprogramming mitochondrial metabolism and suggest SLC25A35 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.",

Compelling evidence suggests that the use of S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine (MTA) can selectively reduce NBA toxicity on normal tissues while maintaining the efficacy of NBAs on methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-deficient cancers. However, we found that MTA induced hypothermia at its effective dose, limiting its translational potential. We hypothesized that an MTA analogue can retain the protective function of MTA without undesired side effects. We screened a library of MTA analogues and identified 5'-S-(3-aminophenyl)-5'-thioadenosine (m-APTA) as a substrate of MTAP that could be converted to adenine, a necessary step for protection of normal cells from NBA toxicity. It selectively protected MTAP-expressing cells from 5-FU toxicity while it did not interfere with the cytotoxicity of 5-FU on isogenic MTAP-deficient cell lines. At effective dose, m-APTA protected the mouse hosts from 5-FU-induced toxicity (i.e., anemia) without the induction of hypothermia. Importantly, m-APTA provided host protection without compromising the efficacy of 5-FU on MTAP-deficient bladder cancer xenografts. In silico docking studies revealed that, unlike MTA, m-APTA interacts inefficiently with adenosine A1 receptor, providing a plausible explanation of the superior safety profile of m-APTA. Therefore, m-APTA can significantly improve the translational potential of the combination treatment strategy that selectively reduces NBA toxicity in normal cells while targeting MTAP-deficient cancers.",

In vitro sensitivity data for drugs targeting the pathway were compiled from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) project.

Colorectal cancers with alterations in one or more of the three genes of the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway, <i>RNF43</i>, <i>CTNNB1</i>, and <i>TCF7L2</i>, in the absence of <i>APC</i> alterations, were frequently microsatellite instability (MSI) high and had high tumor mutation burden (TMB). Cancers with these same alterations in the three genes with or without <i>APC</i> alterations presented a high frequency of mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases, PI3K/AKT pathway genes, and DNA damage response genes. Cell lines without mutations in WNT/\u03b2-catenin/APC pathway components displayed numerically greater sensitivity to inhibitors of the pathway in vitro. Groups of colorectal cancers differing in WNT/\u03b2-catenin/APC pathway alterations present diverse genomic landscapes that could have therapeutic implications for the rational development of inhibitors of the pathway.",

          "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignancies diagnosed among men and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Despite recent advancements in early diagnosis of PCa, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the most common treatment of PCa. Docetaxel (DTX) and Cabazitaxel (CTX) are two of the most extensively used drugs for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, there is a clear medical need for newer and more efficacious therapies for CRPC. FABP5 is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells and chaperones fatty acids to PPARs, which leads to the upregulation of proangiogenic factors, resulting in cell survival and metastasis. The critical role and upregulation of FABP5 in PCa make FABP5 an excellent druggable target for CRPC. We reported a promising anti-PCa activity of truxillic acid monoester (TAME)-based FABP5 inhibitors (SB-FIs) and their synergy with DTX and CTX in vitro and in vivo against PC-3 cells and PC-3 tumor xenografts. In the present work, we performed an extensive SAR study on the potencies of 2nd- and 3rd-generation SB-FIs against PC-3 and RCaP cell lines. RCaP is a mouse PCa cell line, resistant to anti-androgen and first-line taxane chemotherapies, and shows a high level of the Fabp5-gene. This SAR study led to the identification of a number of 3rd-generation SB-FIs with strong cytotoxicity against these two PCa cell lines. Cell cycle analysis of selected SB-FIs revealed a clear evolution of apoptotic potency in the 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-generation SB-FIs. Since taxanes, DTX and CTX, are ineffective against RCaP cell line, we selected a topoisomerase I inhibitor, topotecan (TPT) as a replacement for taxanes. We screened the library of SB-FIs for synergy with TPT and identified 3 SB-FIs (L3, \u03b1-11 and \u03b1-4), exhibiting strong synergy, which could remarkably expand the therapeutic window of TPT.",

          "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs that regulate the expression of target genes after transcription, and play important roles in the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Many miRNAs are related to the occurrence of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and play roles in the treatment response. Recently, we demonstrated that several miRNAs are differentially expressed in patients with relapsed and newly diagnosed APL; for example, miR-140-3p is significantly downregulated in patients with relapsed APL. In this study, via a dual luciferase assay, we verified that one of the direct target genes of miR-140-3p is hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). After different lentiviruses were transfected into NB4 cells, and flow cytometry and proliferation assays confirmed that low expression of miR-140-3p inhibited the differentiation and apoptosis of NB4 cells and induced proliferation by promoting cell cycle progression. In summary, our findings suggest that hepatocyte growth factor is a target gene of miR-140-3p. Moreover, upregulation of miR-140-3p expression in APL cells inhibits cell proliferation, arrests cell cycle progression, and promotes apoptosis and cell differentiation. Monitoring the levels of miR-140-3p and HGF may predict the risk of disease recurrence, and interfering with the miR-140-3p / HGF pathway may have therapeutic potential for treating recurrent APL.",

          "abstract": "As cancer incidence and mortality rates continue to rise, the urgency for research in this field has increased globally. Sideroflexin 1 (SFXN1), a pivotal member of the SFXN protein family, serves a crucial role in transporting serine to mitochondria and participates in one\u2011carbon metabolism, thereby influencing cell proliferation and differentiation. While SFXN1 is linked to lung cancer and glioma, its role in other malignancies remains largely unexplored. Utilizing The Cancer Genome Atlas, Human Protein Atlas, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis and University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Data Analysis Portal databases, the present study investigated the expression patterns, prognostic implications and association with immune cell infiltration of SFXN1. The present findings revealed that SFXN1 was differentially expressed across various tumor types, and exhibited significant associations with clinicopathological features and patient prognosis. Through immune infiltration analysis, a significant correlation between SFXN1 and T cells, B cells and immune checkpoint genes was established in numerous tumor types. Notably, loss\u2011of\u2011function experiments demonstrated that silencing of SFXN1 decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion, while simultaneously increasing apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Collectively, these findings suggested that SFXN1 expression could potentially serve as a biomarker for tumor diagnosis and prognosis, also emerging as a novel therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy. The present study highlights the critical role of SFXN1 in cancer biology and paves the way for future translational efforts aimed at leveraging its potential in clinical oncology.",

Whether AMPK contains other functional mTORC1 substrates is unknown. Using mass spectrometry, we generated precise stoichiometry profiles of phosphorylation sites across all twelve AMPK complexes expressed in proliferating human cells and identified seven sites displaying sensitivity to pharmacological mTORC1 inhibition. These included the abundantly phosphorylated residues \u03b21-S182 and \u03b22-S184, which were confirmed as mTORC1 substrates on purified AMPK, and four residues in the unique \u03b32 N-terminal extension. \u03b2-S182/184 phosphorylation was elevated in \u03b11-containing complexes relative to \u03b12, an effect attributed to the \u03b1-subunit serine/threonine-rich loop. Mutation of \u03b21-S182 to non-phosphorylatable Ala had no effect on basal and ligand-stimulated AMPK activity; however, \u03b22-S184A mutation increased nuclear AMPK activity, enhanced cell proliferation under nutrient stress and altered expression of genes implicated in glucose metabolism and Akt signalling. Our results indicate that mTORC1 directly or indirectly phosphorylates multiple AMPK residues that may contribute to metabolic rewiring in cancerous cells.",

          "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is characterized by a three-dimensional (3D) tumor microenvironment devoid of oxygen and nutrients but enriched in extracellular matrix, which acts as a physical and chemical barrier. In 3D, cancer cells reprogram their metabolic pathways in ways that help them survive hostile conditions. However, little is known about the metabolic phenotypes of cancer cells in 3D and the intrinsic cues that modulate them. We found that Cxcl5 deletion restricted pancreatic tumor growth in a 3D spheroid-in-Matrigel culture system without affecting cancer cell growth in 2D culture. Cxcl5 deletion impaired 3D-specific global metabolic reprogramming, resistance to hypoxia-induced cell death, and upregulation of Hif1\u03b1 and Myc. Overexpression of Hif1\u03b1 and Myc, however, effectively restored 3D culture-induced metabolic reconfiguration, growth, redox homeostasis, and mitochondrial function in Cxcl5<sup>-/-</sup> cells, reducing ferroptosis. We also found that pancreatic cancer patients with higher expression of hypoxia and metabolism-related genes whose expression is well-correlated with CXCL5 generally have poorer prognosis. Together, our findings identify an unanticipated role of Cxcl5 in orchestrating the cancer metabolic reprogramming in 3D culture that is required for energy and biomass maintenance and that restricts oxidative cell death. Thus, our results provide a rationale for targeting CXCL5 as a promising therapeutic strategy.",

In adults, compared to their pediatric counterparts, adult midline gliomas are not as clearly characterized on the clinical behavior, prognostic factors, and treatment approaches for these diseases. This retrospective cohort assessed all adult (\u2265\u200918\u00a0years) patients from our institution with diffuse gliomas arising from midline structures at time of diagnosis (2014-2020). Molecular features characterized using immunohistochemistry, targeted next-generation sequencing, and chromosomal microarray analysis were collected. Patient characteristics were compared across groups using analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis, and the chi-square test as appropriate. Cumulative progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparisons across groups were made using the log rank test. 79 patients were included in analysis, with a median follow-up of 22.5\u00a0months (range, 0.6-123). The mean age at diagnosis was 44.5\u00a0years (range, 19.4-76.4), and 51% (n\u2009=\u200940) were female. Thalamus/basal ganglia was the most common primary tumor location (47%), followed by the brainstem (30%), and cerebellum (23%). For the entire cohort, median PFS was 11.5\u00a0months (95% CI 9.4-20.1), and median OS was 25.5\u00a0months (95% CI 22.0-38.2). We grouped primary tumor types into four distinct diagnostic entities based on integrated histological and molecular features, which had survival differences (log-rank p\u2009=\u20090.007)-diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27-altered (17% with median OS 19.4\u00a0months); astrocytoma, IDH-wild type, not otherwise specified (42% with median OS 25.5\u00a0months); glioblastoma, IDH-wild type (24% with median OS 11.0\u00a0months); and astrocytoma, IDH-mutant (18% with OS 63.3\u00a0months). There were no cases of IDH-mutant tumors in the thalamus/basal ganglia.

          "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that glycolysis-related genes (GRGs) are associated with the development of breast cancer (BC), and the prognostic significance of GRGs in BC has been reported. Considering the heterogeneity of BC patients, which makes prognosis difficult to predict, and the fact that glycolysis is regulated by multiple genes, it is important to establish and evaluate new glycolysis-related prediction models in BC. In total, 170 GRGs were selected from the GeneCards database. We analyzed data from the Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA) database as a training set and data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database as a validation cohort. Based on the overall survival data and the expression levels of GRGs, Cox regression analyses were applied to develop a glycolysis-related prognostic gene (GRPGs)-based prediction model. Kaplan (KM) survival and ROC analyses were performed to assess the performance of this model. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were used to identify the potential biological functions of GRPGs. cBioPortal database was used to explore the tumor mutation burden (TMB). The tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion indicator (TIDE) was used to estimate the patient response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). The levels of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) and stromal cells were quantitatively analyzed based on gene expression profiles. We constructed a prediction model of 10 GRPGs (ADPGK, HNRNPA1, PGAM1, PIM2, YWHAZ, PTK2, VDAC1, CS, PGK1, and GAPDHS) to predict the survival outcomes of patients with BC. Patients were divided into low- and high-risk groups based on the gene signature. The AUC values of the ROC curves were 0.700 (1-year OS), 0.714 (3-year OS), 0.681 (5-year OS). TMB and TIDE analyses showed that patients in the high-risk group might respond better to ICB. Additionally, by combining the GRPGs signature and clinical characteristics of patients, a novel nomogram was constructed. The AUC values for this combined prediction model were 0.827 (1-year OS), 0.792 (3-year OS), and 0.783 (5-year OS), indicating an outstanding predictive performance. A new GRPGs based prediction model was built to predict the OS and immunotherapeutic response of patients with BC.",

CH is associated with systemic inflammation, but its impact on tumor biology is underexplored. Here, we report the effects of CH on the tumor microenvironment (TME) using 1,550 treatment-naive patient samples from the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) cohort. CH is present in 18.3% of patients, with one-third of CH mutations also detectable in tumor-derived DNA from the same individual (CH-Tum), reflecting CH-mutant leukocyte infiltration. Across cancers, the presence of CH-Tum is associated with worse survival outcomes. Molecular analyses reveal an association between CH-Tum and an immune-rich, inflammatory TME that is notably distinct from age-related gene expression changes. These effects are most prominent in glioblastoma, where CH correlates with pronounced macrophage infiltration, inflammation, and an aggressive, mesenchymal phenotype. Our findings demonstrate that CH shapes the TME, with potential applications as a biomarker in precision oncology.",

Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have increasingly been used to inform healthcare decisions, but these models are vulnerable to biases in data collection and algorithm creation. ML models have previously been shown to exhibit racial bias, but their fairness towards patients from different age and sex groups have yet to be studied. Therefore, we compared the multimetric performances of 5 ML models (random forests, multinomial logistic regression, linear support vector classifier, linear discriminant analysis, and multilayer perceptron) when classifying colorectal cancer patients (<i>n</i>=515) of various age, sex, and racial groups using the TCGA data. All five models exhibited biases for these sociodemographic groups. We then repeated the same process on lung adenocarcinoma (<i>n</i>=589) to validate our findings. Surprisingly, most models tended to perform more poorly overall for the largest sociodemographic groups. Methods to optimize model performance, including testing the model on merged age, sex, or racial groups, and creating a model trained on and used for an individual or merged sociodemographic group, show potential to reduce disparities in model performance for different groups. Notably, these methods may be used to improve ML fairness while avoiding penalizing the model for exhibiting bias and thus sacrificing overall performance.",

The genomic landscape of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) showed a broader mutation spectrum compared to tumor tissue DNA (tDNA), and provided reliable assessments of microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutation burden (TMB), homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), and loss of heterogeneity (LOH), all indicating high genomic instability.

Although its loss of expression has been linked to breast cancer invasion and metastasis, the underlying mechanisms driving tumour progression upon mutational Afadin (AFDN) loss in breast cancers remains unclear. In the current study we identified a somatic frameshift AFDN mutation (p.Lys630fs) in an invasive breast cancer sample that coincides with loss of Afadin protein expression. Functional studies in E-cadherin-expressing breast cancer cells show that Afadin loss leads to immature and aberrant adherens junction (AJ) formation. The lack of AJ maturation results in a noncohesive cellular phenotype accompanied by Actomyosin-dependent anoikis resistance, which are classical progression hallmarks of single-cell breast cancer invasion. Reconstitution experiments using Afadin truncates show that proper F-actin organisation and epithelial cell-cell adhesion critically depend on the Coiled-Coil domain of Afadin but not on the designated C-terminal F-actin binding domain. Mouse xenograft experiments based on cell lines and primary patient-derived breast cancer organoids demonstrate that Afadin loss induces single-cell lobular-type invasion phenotypes and overt dissemination to the lungs and the peritoneum. In short, Afadin is a metastasis suppressor for breast cancer through stabilisation and maturation of a mechanical E-cadherin to F-actin outside-in link. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms inducing YST development from its stem cell-like precursor embryonal carcinoma (EC) are largely unexplored. We demonstrated that the induction of the transcription factor SOX17 together with the stimulation of WNT, TGF-beta / Activin, and FGF signaling drives EC cells into the YST lineage. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed that this cell fate switch was accompanied by the upregulation of the typical YST factors AFP, ANKRD1, APOA1, CST1, FOXA2, GATA6, and GPC3 and microRNAs, while pluripotency-related genes NANOG, POU5F1, and SOX2 were downregulated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing analysis revealed that SOX17 may act in concert with FOXA2 and GATA factors to initiate YST formation. Xenografting of the YST-like cells into nude mice led to the growth of mixed GCT with YST components, confirming that these cells are able to form a YST in vivo. Moreover, the expression of cisplatin resistance factors was induced in a subpopulation of YST-like cells, suggesting that the formation of a YST is accompanied by the acquisition of cisplatin resistance. Indeed, the YST-like cells presented as less sensitive to cisplatin than their parental cells. Our study deciphered the molecular mechanisms forcing EC to differentiate into the YST lineage, which is accompanied by the acquisition of cisplatin resistance, confirming that YST formation is an escape mechanism for GCT under therapy. Thus, GCT patients should be screened for YST elements under therapy to identify patients at risk of developing therapy resistance.",

We report that gene amplification or overexpression of the mTORC2-required cofactor RICTOR correlated with increased mTORC2 signaling and worse patient outcomes in clinical breast cancer expression datasets, supporting studies examining selective mTORC2 inhibition in TNBC. The mTOR kinase inhibitor PP242 blocks both mTORC1 and mTORC2, which decreases growth and survival of RICTOR-amplified TNBC cells. However, mTORC1 inhibition by PP242 causes resurgent PI3K signaling, limiting its therapeutic impact. In contrast, knockdown using siRNA designed against Rictor (siRictor) did not increase PI3K or mTORC1 signaling but potently blocked mTORC2 signaling, resulting in robust inhibition of tumor cell growth and survival. We developed siRictor-loaded nanoparticles to enable therapeutic testing of RICTOR silencing in TNBCs in vivo. Intravenous delivery of this mTORC2-selective nanomedicine achieved siRNA accumulation and on-target gene silencing in TNBC tumors in vivo. RICTOR silencing blocked tumor mTORC2 signaling and growth in multiple TNBC mouse models while also improving TNBC tumor response to chemotherapy. These findings support the further development of technologies for therapeutic RICTOR silencing as an effective approach for mTORC2-selective inhibition and treatment in TNBC. We identified an mTORC2/Rictor-directed RNAi nanomedicine that cooperates with chemotherapy to enhance in vivo tumor cell killing in PI3K-active TNBCs.",

Patients with TP53-mutant (mut) dominant tumors (all TP53-mut) and KRAS-mut focused tumors (TP53-wild-type (wt)/GNAS-wt/KRAS-mut/any SMAD4) showed a poorer median OS compared with those with GNAS-mut focused tumors (TP53-wt/GNAS-mut/any KRAS /any SMAD4) (median 47.4 and 37.5\u00a0months vs. not reached; p\u2009=\u20090.01 and p\u2009=\u20090.01, respectively). TP53 mutation was associated with poor time to treatment failure and OS with the oxaliplatin-based regimen for first-line chemotherapy. This study suggested that the genetic mutations influenced the prognosis and chemotherapy efficacy in AC.",

This study analyzed the differential expression of m7G-related genes (m7GRGs) in HNSCC using the TCGA-HNSCC dataset, identifying key pathways associated with the cell cycle, DNA replication, and focal adhesion. A LASSO-Cox regression model was constructed based on four m7GRGs (EIF3D, EIF1, LARP1, and METTL1) and validated with GEO datasets and clinical samples. Further validation of gene upregulation in HNSCC tissues was conducted using RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry, while the role of LARP1 in HNSCC cells was assessed via knockout experiments. The constructed model demonstrated strong predictive performance, with the risk score significantly correlating with prognosis, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity. An external dataset and clinical specimens further confirmed the model's predictive accuracy for immunotherapy response. Additionally, two regulatory axes-LINC00707/hsa-miR-30b-5p/LARP1 and SNHG16/hsa-miR-30b-5p/LARP1-were identified. LARP1 knockout experiments revealed that suppressing LARP1 markedly inhibited HNSCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The m7GRG-based prognostic model developed in this study holds strong clinical potential for predicting prognosis and therapeutic responses in HNSCC. The identification of LARP1 and its related regulatory pathways offers new avenues for targeted therapy in HNSCC.",

Phenotype-specific expression of the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase is a pivotal player in dormancy, invasion, and resistance to treatment. However, although the AXL ligand GAS6 is present within tumors, how AXL is activated in metastasizing cells remains unclear. Here, using melanoma as a model, we reveal that AXL is activated by exposure to human adipocytes and to oleic acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid abundant in lymph and in adipocytes. AXL activation triggers SRC-dependent formation and nuclear translocation of a \u03b2-catenin-CAV1 complex required for melanoma invasiveness. Remarkably, only undifferentiated AXL<sup>High</sup> melanoma cells engage in symbiosis with human adipocytes, in part by triggering WNT5a-mediated lipolysis, leading to AXL-dependent, but FATP-independent, fatty acid uptake and nuclear localization of the \u03b2-catenin-CAV1 complex. Significantly, human melanomas in the vicinity of adipocytes exhibit high levels of nuclear CAV1. The results unveil an AXL- and CAV1-dependent mechanism through which a nutritional input drives phenotype-specific activation of a prometastasis program. Given the key role of AXL in a broad range of cancers, the results offer major insights into the mechanisms of cancer cell dormancy and therapy resistance.",

We investigated the diagnostic and prognostic value of COIL expression in HCC. This study evaluated the expression and prognostic significance of COIL using data from the TCGA and local hospital samples, with 374 and 118 liver cancer patients in the TCGA database and local hospital, respectively. The techniques include bioinformatics analysis, qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and in vitro cell experiments, which encompass CCK-8 assays, wound healing assays, and Transwell invasion assays. The relationship between COIL expression and clinical outcomes was assessed, and COIL's biological function in HCC was investigated through cellular assays. Analysis of cell lines and HCC tissue samples revealed that COIL mRNA or protein expression levels were significantly higher in HCC cell lines/tissues compared to normal liver cells/tissues. Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that COIL is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in HCC. Additionally, 14% of HCC patients had alterations in the COIL gene, and patients with COIL gene alterations had significantly lower OS (p<0.001) and disease-free survival (DFS) (p<0.001) compared to those without gene alterations. Knockdown of COIL expression inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of Hep3B, HepG2, and Huh7. Compared to the control group, COIL knockdown cells showed a marked reduction in CDC25C and CCNB1 protein levels, suggesting that COIL knockdown leads to G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. After COIL knockdown, caspase-3 and BCL-2 protein levels were downregulated, while cleaved caspase and BAX protein levels were upregulated, indicating that COIL knockdown promotes apoptosis in liver cancer cells. COIL is an independent predictor of prognosis. COIL's association with poor OS and its role in enhancing cancer cell proliferation and invasion highlight its potential as a therapeutic target.",

Objectives: Here, we sought to investigate the potential of DNAJC12 mRNA and protein expression as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for breast cancer (BC). Using in silico analysis and data from immunohistochemistry analysis (IHC) of 292 samples from patients with primary BC, we determined the expression pattern and prognostic value of DNAJC12 mRNA and protein expression. From online publicly available data, we were able to identify the transcripts of DNAJC12 as differentially expressed in patients with different clinicopathological characteristics, such as ER status (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u2009.001), PR status (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u2009.001), HER2 status (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u2009.010) and molecular subtype (<i>P</i>\u2009\u2a7d\u2009.001). We also found DNAJC12 to be a potential prognostic predictor for overall survival, disease-free survival, and responsiveness to treatment; a low DNAJC12 mRNA expression is commonly associated with a worse prognosis. Using IHC analysis, we showed that low DNAJC12 protein-level expression is also associated with a worse prognosis in patients with all subtypes of BC and patients with Luminal BC, and its expression is significantly different between patients with different tumor size classifications (T1/T2 vs T3/T4; <i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.013) or with different lymph node involvement (N0 vs N+; <i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.005).

Standard treatments include surgical resection and therapies such as anthracyclines or trabectedin for advanced cases, though challenges persist due to the tumor microenvironment's complexity and limited immune profiling data. This study evaluates Trabectedin therapy in 22 refractory STS patients, analyzing progression-free survival (PFS) and immune responses. Immune monitoring included deep immunophenotyping (200+ parameters), gene expression profiling (103 genes), and soluble proteome analysis (99 analytes). Using RECIST1.1 criteria, 68.2% of patients achieved stable disease (SD), while 31.8% exhibited progression disease (PD). Therapy duration revealed 59.1% treated for less than 12 months (<12M) and 40.9% for 12 or more months (\u226512M). A significant PFS improvement was observed in SD versus PD patients (p=0.0154), while therapy duration showed no effect (p=0.5433). PD patients showed reduced eosinophils (p<0.05) and Th2 cells (p<0.05). Gene expression analysis identified changes in BTRC (decreased), IFNA1 (increased), and IL9 (increased) in PD versus SD patients (p<0.05). Patients treated \u226512M exhibited increased activated HLA-DR Th2 cells (p<0.05) and decreased exhausted B cells and NK cell subsets (p<0.05). Principal component and hierarchical clustering analyses identified distinct immune profiles associated with RECIST1.1 and therapy duration, underscoring immune profiling's role in understanding treatment responses.

Men of African descent (AF) are more likely to develop PC and face higher mortality compared to men of European descent (EU). The biological mechanisms underlying these differences remain unclear. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), recognized as key regulators of gene expression and immune processes, have emerged as potential contributors to these disparities. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory role of lncRNAs in localized PC in AF men relative to those of EU and assess their involvement in immune response and inflammation. A systems biology approach was employed to analyze differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and their roles in prostate cancer (PC). Immune-related pathways were investigated through over-representation analysis of lncRNA-mRNA networks. The study also examined the effects of vitamin D supplementation on lncRNA expression in African descent (AF) PC patients, highlighting their potential regulatory roles in immune response and inflammation. Key lncRNAs specific to AF men were identified, with several being implicated for immune response and inflammatory processes. Notably, 10 out of the top 11 ranked lncRNAs demonstrated strong interactions with immune-related genes. Pathway analysis revealed their regulatory influence on antigen processing and presentation, chemokine signaling, and ribosome pathways, suggesting their critical roles in immune regulation. These findings highlight the pivotal role of lncRNAs in PC racial disparities, particularly through immune modulation. The identified lncRNAs may serve as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets to address racial disparities in PC outcomes.",

However, no study to date has focused on the metastatic coagulome along these trajectories. Using bulk-tumor and single-cell analyses of primary SKCM, metastastic samples and circulating tumor cells (CTCs), we explored the coagulome of SKCM along metastatic progression. We identified consistent changes in the coagulome of SKCM metastases compared to primary tumors and observed metastatic site specificity.

Single-cell analyses were used to chart the inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity and characterize the metastatic coagulome of SKCM.

Immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting assays were used to evaluate the biological roles of MIDN in breast and gastric cancer cells. <b>Results</b>: MIDN expression was dysregulated in many cancers and associated with prognosis in several cancers, such as esophageal cancer. MIDN was mutated in 1.7% of cancers, and deep deletion was the dominant mutation type. NR4A1, PSMC1, and EGR1 were selected as MIDN-interacted proteins, and these four molecules were co-expressed in pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, urothelial cancer, melanoma, and breast cancer. MIDN expression was significantly correlated with the infiltration of CD8+ T cell, CD4+ T cell, B cell, macrophage, neutrophil, and DC both in prostate adenocarcinoma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma. The MIDN level was correlated with several immune checkpoint genes, such as VEGFA, and RNA modification genes such as YTHDF1, YTHDF2, YTHDF3, and YTHDC1 in cancers. Furthermore, in breast cancer cells, the downregulation of MIDN suppressed the colony formation abilities and lessened cell-cycle-associated and stemness-associated genes; in gastric cancer, the knockdown of MIDN diminished the mRNA levels of Nanog and LDHA. Strikingly, silence of MIDN upregulated FTO protein expression in both breast and gastric cancer cells. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our findings demonstrate the expression, prognostic value, mutation status, interacting proteins, methylation status, and correlations with the tumor immune microenvironment of MIDN.

A total of eight genes were shortlisted and subsequently ranked according to the combination of their transcript and protein expression levels in HCC cases (n\u2009=\u2009791) derived from four independent datasets. TM4SF4 was the top-ranked target with the highest expression in HCCs. TM4SF4 showed more favorable expression profile with significantly lower expression in normal human tissues but more highly expressed in HCC compared with seven other common HCC therapeutic targets. Furthermore, scRNA-seq and immunohistochemistry datasets showed that TM4SF4 was absent in immune cell populations but highly expressed in the bile duct canaliculi of hepatocytes, regions inaccessible to immune cells. In scRNA-seq dataset of HCCs, TM4SF4 expression was positively associated with mitochondrial components and oxidative phosphorylation Gene Ontologies in HCC cells (n\u2009=\u200915,787 cells), suggesting its potential roles in mitochondrial-mediated oncogenic effects in HCC. Taken together, TM4SF4 is proposed as a promising cell surface target in HCC due to its high expression in HCC cells with restricted expression profile in non-cancerous tissues, and association with HCC oncogenic pathways.",

          "abstract": "HNSCC presents a significant health challenge due to its high mortality resulting from treatment resistance and locoregional invasion into critical structures in the head and neck region. Understanding the invasion mechanisms of HNSCC has the potential to guide targeted therapies, improving patient survival. Previously, we demonstrated the involvement of doublecortin like kinase 1 (DCLK1) in regulating HNSCC cell invasion. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that DCLK1 modulates proteins within invadopodia, specialized subcellular protrusions that secrete matrix metalloproteinases to degrade the ECM. We employed tandem mass tag (TMT)-based proteomics to identify the role of DCLK1 in regulating proteins involved in HNSCC invasion and validated the findings using immunoblotting. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was interrogated to correlate DCLK1 expression with tumor stage, grade, and invasion-associated proteins. In vitro invasion was assessed using a Boyden chamber assay, and immunohistochemistry on patient samples determined DCLK1's distribution within tumors. Gelatin invadopodia assay was used to establish DCLK1 localization to invadopodia related gelatin degradation. Super-resolution confocal microscopy demonstrated colocalization of DCLK1 with invadopodia markers and MMP trafficking proteins. ECM degradation by MMPs in HNSCC cells with wild-type and knockdown DCLK1 was evaluated using a dye-quenched tracer, while gel zymography and MMP array identified secreted proteases. Proximity ligation assay (PLA) and co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to confirm interactions between DCLK1, MMP9, KIF16B, and RAB40B. Proteomic analysis demonstrate DCLK1's role in regulating proteins involved in cytoskeletal and ECM remodeling. Clinically, rising DCLK1 levels correlate with higher histological grade and lymph node metastasis, with heightened expression observed at the leading edge of HNSCC patient tissue. DCLK1 is localized with markers of mature invadopodia including TKS4, TKS5, cortactin, and MT1-MMP. Knockdown of DCLK1 led to reductions in invadopodia numbers and decreased in vitro invasion and ECM degradation. MMP9 colocalizes with DCLK1 within invadopodia structures and its secretion is disrupted by DCLK1 knockdown. Further, PLA and co-immunoprecipitations studies demonstrate DLCK1 complexes with KIF16B and RAB40B enabling trafficking of degradative MMP9 cargo along the invadopodia to degrade local ECM. This work unveils a novel function of DCLK1 in regulating KIF16B and RAB40B to traffic matrix degrading MMP9 cargo to the distal end of the invadopodia facilitating HNSCC invasion.",

Building on our previous findings, we asked how the lysine methyltransferase SETD1A contributed to PARP inhibitor-mediated cell death in these contexts\u00a0and determined the mechanisms responsible. We used cervical, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells bearing mutations in BRCA1 or ATM and depleted SETD1A using siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9. We assessed the effects of the PARPi Olaparib on cell viability, homologous recombination, and DNA repair. We assessed underlying transcriptional perturbations using RNAseq. We used The Cancer Genomics Atlas (TCGA) and DepMap to investigate patient survival and cancer cell characteristics. Loss of SETD1A from both BRCA1-deficient and ATM-deficient cancer cells was associated with resistance to Olaparib, explained by partial restoration of homologous recombination. Mechanistically, SETD1A-dependent transcription of the crossover junction endonuclease EME1 correlated with sensitivity to Olaparib in these cells. Accordingly, when SETD1A or EME1 was lost, BRCA1 or ATM-mutated cells became resistant to Olaparib, and homologous recombination was partially restored. Loss of SETD1A or EME1 drives cellular resistance to Olaparib\u00a0in certain genetic contexts\u00a0and may help explain why patients develop resistance to PARP inhibitors in the clinic.",

However, BRAFV600E is insufficient to drive melanoma in genetically engineered mouse models, and 82% of human benign nevi harbor BRAFV600E mutations. We found that BRAFV600E inhibited mesenchymal migration by causing feedback inhibition of RAC1 activity. ERK pathway inhibition induced RAC1 activation and restored migration and invasion. In cells with BRAFV600E, mutant RAC1 or PTEN inactivation restored RAC1 activity and cell motility. Together, these lesions occurred in 26% of melanomas with BRAFV600E mutations. Thus, although BRAFV600E activation of ERK deregulates cell proliferation, it prevents full malignant transformation by causing feedback inhibition of RAC1. Secondary mutations are, therefore, required for tumorigenesis. One mechanism underlying tumor evolution may be the selection of lesions that rescue the deleterious effects of oncogenic drivers. Significance: Secondary genetic lesions that rescue BRAFV600E/ERK-induced feedback inhibition on cell migration are required for tumorigenesis, indicating that oncogenic feedback may shape the genetic landscape and select for mutations that are therapeutic targets.",

Cytoskeletal and ECM transcripts subject to exon inclusion events included vinculin (VCL), tenascin C (TNC), and CD44. Knockdown of the VCL exon inclusion transcript in RBM10-null cells reduced cell velocity, whereas knockdown of TNC and CD44 exon inclusion isoforms reduced invasiveness.

Mouse HrasG12V/Rbm1OKO thyrocytes develop metastases that are reversed by RBM10 expression or by combined knockdown of VCL, CD44, and TNC inclusion isoforms.

By promoting oxidative phosphorylation while inhibiting glycolysis and anabolic pathways, wild-type p53 counters metabolic reprogramming characteristic of cancer cells, such as the Warburg effect, and protects cells from mild cellular stresses. In contrast, mutant p53 disrupts these processes, fostering metabolic adaptations that support tumor progression.

However, in advanced stages, MSI-H tumors lose this survival advantage for reasons that remain unclear. We developed a syngeneic mouse model of MSI cancer by knocking out the MMR gene Msh2 in the metastatic 4T1 breast cancer cell line. This model mirrored genomic features of MSI-H cancers and showed reduction in metastatic incidence compared to their MSS counterparts. In MSI-H tumors, we observed an enrichment of immune gene-signatures that negatively correlated with metastasis incidence. A hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal signature, related to aggressiveness was detected only in metastatic MSI-H tumors. Interestingly, we identified immature myeloid cells at primary and metastatic sites in MSI-H tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that MMR deficiency elicits specific immune responses beyond T-cell activation.",

Here, we characterize the genetic alterations and tumor microenvironment (TME) for EAO and later-age-onset (LAO) CRCs to identify relevant biological differences that might point to etiologic factors. A cohort of EAO (<i>n\u2009</i>=<i>\u2009</i>60) and LAO (<i>n\u2009</i>=<i>\u2009</i>93) CRC patients were evaluated for mutations by using targeted DNA sequencing and for TME differences by using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence.

Gene-set enrichment analysis of TCGA data revealed the downregulation of immune-related pathways in EAO CRCs. Both age cohorts had similar numbers of CD8<sup>+</sup> tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), although LAO patients had more CD4<sup>+</sup> TILs and Th1-polarized CD4s. While significant associations between immune subsets and versican (VCAN), versikine, and alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA) were found, none of these trends differed between age cohorts. EAO patients trended towards greater VCAN accumulation in adjacent normal tissue, lower rates of VCAN proteolysis, and decreased \u03b1SMA accumulation vs LAO patients. Overall, established EAO cancers are similar to LAO cancers in mutational profile and key TME features. High VCAN and \u03b1SMA expression in adjacent normal colon indicates a presence of factors that are associated with increased intestinal subclinical inflammation. Future mechanistic studies will be conducted to better understand the importance of these findings and related processes should be prioritized as potential etiologic factors for EAO tumorigenesis.",

Although we estimate that around 3,000 new appendiceal cancer cases are diagnosed annually in the USA, the challenges of accurately diagnosing and identifying this tumour type suggest that this number may underestimate true population incidence. In the current absence of disease-specific screening and diagnostic imaging modalities, or well-established risk factors, the incidental discovery of appendix tumours is often prompted by acute presentations mimicking appendicitis or when the tumour has already spread into the abdominal cavity - wherein the potential misclassification of appendiceal tumours as malignancies of the colon and ovaries also increases. Notwithstanding these diagnostic difficulties, our understanding of appendix carcinogenesis has advanced in recent years. However, there persist considerable challenges to accelerating the pace of research discoveries towards the path to improved treatments and cures for patients with this group of orphan malignancies. The premise of this Expert Recommendation article is to discuss the current state of the field, to delineate unique challenges for the study of appendiceal tumours, and to propose key priority research areas that will deliver a more complete picture of appendix carcinogenesis and metastasis. The Appendix Cancer Pseudomyxoma Peritonei (ACPMP) Research Foundation Scientific Think Tank delivered a consensus of core research priorities for appendiceal tumours that are poised to be ground-breaking and transformative for scientific discovery and innovation.

PTEN negatively regulates PI3K signaling and its downstream effectors including COX2. COX2 mediates the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) which contributes to immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. PGE2 also binds to one or more EP receptors (EP1-EP4) and promotes the growth of tumor cells via activation of EP2 and EP4. However, the role of PGE2 in PTEN-deficient HNSCC is incompletely understood. In this study, we assessed PGE2 signaling in PTEN-deficient HNSCC and evaluated the effect of aspirin or TPST-1495, a dual EP2/EP4 antagonist, on the growth of PTEN knockout and PIK3CA-altered HNSCC tumors in immunocompetent mice. Our results demonstrated that aspirin selectively inhibits the growth of PTEN knockout HNSCC tumors. TPST-1495 inhibited tumor growth and substantially increased the antitumor activity of the immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD1. To date, there are no FDA-approved therapies for PI3K pathway-altered HNSCC. Our findings suggest that NSAIDs demonstrate antitumor activity in PTEN-deficient or PI3K-altered tumors whereas EP2/EP4 targeting may augment FDA-approved anti-PD1 therapy in HNSCC.",

          "abstract": "Generation of reactive oxygen species is an important part of the innate immune response. Generating microbicidal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) requires adaptation of mucosal barriers. High tolerance of ROS provides improved innate immune defenses against pathogens, whereas low tolerance renders host cells prone to chronic toxicity and mutagenesis, which can promote inflammation (e.g., in asthma and Crohn's disease) and cancerogenesis. The mechanisms that sense and mediate host tolerance to ROS are little understood. In this study, we discover an unexpected role for the redox-sensitive, chemokine-like lipid 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-KETE) in redox adaptation. 5-KETE is known to attract leukocytes to damaged/infected mucosal barriers by signaling through its receptor, OXER1. Suggestive of a distinct non-immune function, we here report that the loss of the OXER1 ortholog Hcar1-4 causes barrier defects and baseline inflammation in the intestine of live zebrafish larvae. In zebrafish and cultured human cells, OXER1 signaling protects against oxidative nucleotide lesions by inducing DNA-protective Nudix hydrolases. Our data reveal the oxoeicosanoid pathway as a conserved ROS resilience mechanism that fortifies pathogen-exposed mucosal linings against increased oxidative stress <i>in vivo</i>.",

          "abstract": "Prognostic transcriptomic signatures for prostate cancer (PCa) often overlook the cellular origin of expression changes, an important consideration given the heterogeneity of the disorder. Current clinicopathological factors inadequately predict biochemical recurrence, a critical indicator guiding post-treatment strategies following radical prostatectomy. To address this, we conducted a meta-analysis of four large-scale PCa datasets and found 33 previously reported PCa-associated genes to be consistently up-regulated in prostate tumours. By analysing single-cell RNA-sequencing data, we found these genes predominantly as markers in epithelial cells. Subsequently, we applied 97 advanced machine-learning algorithms across five PCa cohorts and developed an 11-gene epithelial expression signature. This signature robustly predicted biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS) and stratified patients into distinct risk categories, with high-risk patients showing worse survival and altered immune cell populations. The signature outperformed traditional clinical parameters in larger cohorts and was overall superior to published PCa signatures for BCRFS. By analysing peripheral blood data, four of our signature genes showed potential as biomarkers for radiation response in patients with localised cancer and effectively stratified castration-resistant patients for overall survival. In conclusion, this study developed a novel epithelial gene-expression signature that enhanced BCRFS prediction and enabled effective risk stratification compared to existing clinical- and gene-expression-derived prognostic tools. Furthermore, a set of genes from the signature demonstrated potential utility in peripheral blood, a tissue amenable to minimally invasive sampling in a primary care setting, offering significant prognostic value for PCa patients without requiring a tumour biopsy.",

          "abstract": "Therapeutic resistance to immune checkpoint blockade has been commonly linked to the process of mesenchymal transformation (MT) and remains a prevalent obstacle across many cancer types. An improved mechanistic understanding for MT-mediated immune evasion promises to lead to more effective combination therapeutic regimens. Herein, we identified the hedgehog transcription factor, GLI2, as a key node of tumor-mediated immune evasion and immunotherapy resistance during MT. GLI2 generated an immunotolerant tumor microenvironment through the upregulation of WNT ligand production and increased prostaglandin synthesis. This pathway drove the recruitment, viability, and function of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells while also impairing type I conventional dendritic cell, CD8+ T-cell, and NK cell functionality. Pharmacologic inhibition of EP2/EP4 prostaglandin receptor signaling or WNT ligand secretion each reversed a subset of the immunomodulatory effects of GLI2 and prevented primary and adaptive resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, respectively. A transcriptional GLI2 signature correlated with resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in patients with stage IV melanoma. Together, these findings provide a translational roadmap to direct combination immunotherapies in the clinic. Significance: WNT and prostaglandin signaling generate an immunotolerant environment in GLI2-active tumors and can be targeted as a component of immunotherapeutic combination strategies to overcome resistance in tumors exhibiting mesenchymal plasticity.",

Studies have revealed a correlation between the phenotypes of immune cells and the incidence of breast cancer; nevertheless, the causal relationship has yet to be fully elucidated. Hence, we sought to ascertain the causal relationship between immune cell subtypes and breast cancer through the implementation of Mendelian randomization (MR). MR analysis utilized freely available genetic data to explore the causation link between 731 immune cell phenotypes and the susceptibility to breast cancer, distinguishing between estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) subtypes. ER+ patients are sensitive to endocrine drugs, and one more way to treat with endocrine drugs than ER- patients. Inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger regression, and weighted median methods were employed to evaluate MR. The IVW analysis was used as the primary research methodology. Among 731 immune phenotypes, we found that breast cancer was causally related to eight immune phenotypes, six of which were protective against breast cancer, while two were risk factors. After grouping breast cancers based on the ER expression, ER+ breast cancer patients were significantly causally related to seven immune phenotypes, among which three were protective against ER+ breast cancers, and four were risk factors. Furthermore, ER-breast cancer patients were significantly causally related to 10 immune phenotypes, with four being protective against ER-breast cancers and six being risk factors. This MR Study proved that there is a certain genetic relationship between immune cell phenotype and breast cancer, and the related genes may have certain significance for the treatment and drug development of breast cancer.",

Consequently, studies that employ <i>TP53</i>-wild type cancer cells and their isogenic derivatives may systematically fail to appreciate the full scope of p53 functionality. Several <i>TP53</i> phenotypes are known to be absent in the widely used isogenic HCT116 colorectal cancer (CRC) model, which originated from a tumor that had retained wild type <i>TP53</i>. In contrast, we show that restoration of p53 in the <i>TP53</i>-mutant CRC cell line DLD-1 impeded cell proliferation, increased levels of senescence and sensitized cells to ionizing radiation (IR). To study p53 in a non-cancer context, we disrupted <i>TP53</i> in hTERT-RPE1 cells. Derived from primary cells that were immortalized <i>in vitro</i>, hTERT-RPE1 expressed striking p53-dependent phenotypes and appeared to select for p53 loss during routine culture. hTERT-RPE1 expressed a p53-responsive transcriptome that was highly representative of diverse experimental systems. We discovered several novel downstream p53 targets of potential clinical relevance including <i>ALDH3A1</i>, which is involved in the detoxification of aldehydes and the metabolism of reactive oxygen species, and <i>nectin cell adhesion molecule 4</i> (<i>NECTIN4</i>) which encodes a secreted surface protein that is overexpressed in many tumors.",

Best studied in relation to haematological malignancies, associated functional outcomes are attributed mainly to loss and/or dysfunction of TP53, which is located at 17p13.1, but the wider impact of deletion of other genes located on 17p is poorly understood. 17p is one of the most gene-dense regions of the genome and includes tumour suppressor genes additional to TP53, genes essential for cell survival and proliferation, as well as small and long non-coding RNAs. In this review we utilise a data-driven approach to demarcate the extent of 17p deletion in multiple cancers and identify a common loss-of-function gene signature. We discuss how the resultant loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and haploinsufficiency may influence cell behaviour but also identify vulnerabilities that can potentially be exploited therapeutically. Finally, we highlight how emerging animal and isogenic cell line models of del17p can provide critical biological insights for cancer cell behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Our previous study found that Achaete-scute complex homolog 1 (ASCL1) is involved in classifying BC subtypes with different prognostic and\u00a0pathological characteristics. However, the biological role of ASCL1 in BC still remains largely unexplored. This study aims to elucidate the function of ASCL1 in BC using bioinformatics analyses, as well as <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experimental approaches. Data from the TCGA, GEO, and Human Protein Atlas databases were utilized to evaluate ASCL1 expression in BC and its association with patient prognosis. Genetic alterations in ASCL1 were assessed through the COSMIC and cBioPortal databases, while the TIMER2.0 database provided insights into the relationship between ASCL1 expression and key gene mutations in BC. The GDSC database was used to examine correlations between ASCL1 levels and sensitivity to standard chemotherapeutic agents. Associations between ASCL1 expression and cytokines, immunomodulatory factors, MHC molecules, and receptors were analyzed using Pearson and Spearman correlation methods. The TIP database was employed to investigate the connection between ASCL1 expression and immunoreactivity scores, and six computational approaches were applied to evaluate immune cell infiltration. Functional assays were conducted on BC cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, and nude mouse models were used for <i>in vivo</i> studies. ASCL1 was found to be upregulated in BC and correlated with unfavorable prognosis and mutations in key oncogenes. Its expression was linked to immunomodulatory factors, immune cell infiltration, and immunoreactivity scores in the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, ASCL1 influenced tumor immune dynamics and chemosensitivity in BC. Overexpression of ASCL1 enhanced BC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, while its knockdown had the opposite effect. Notably, inhibition of ASCL1 increased BC cell sensitivity to paclitaxel both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. In addition, inhibition of ASCL1 activated ferroptosis in BC, including altered mitochondrial morphology, increased MDA and ROS levels, decreased GSH levels and reduced GSH/GSSG ratio. Mechanistically, inhibition of ASCL1 decreases the phosphorylation of CREB1, thus reducing the expression of GPX4. In summary, inhibition of ASCL1 increases paclitaxel sensitivity by activating ferroptosis via the CREB1/GPX4 axis. ASCL1 exerts oncogenic effects in BC and represents a potential therapeutic target for intervention.",

Studying the abnormal characteristics of PCD pathway-related molecular markers can provide a basis for prognosis prediction and targeted drug design in AML patients. A total of 1394 genes representing 13 different PCD pathways were examined in AML patients and healthy donors. The upregulated genes were analyzed for their ability to predict overall survival (OS) individually, and these prognostic genes were subsequently combined to construct a PCD-related prognostic signature via an integrated approach consisting of 101 models based on ten machine learning algorithms. RNA transcriptome and clinical data from multiple AML cohorts (TCGA-AML, GSE106291, GSE146173 and Beat AML) were obtained to develop and validate the AML prognostic model. A total of 214 upregulated PCD-related genes were identified in AML patients, 39 of which were proven to be prognostic genes in the training cohort. On the basis of the average C-index and number of model genes identified from the machine learning combinations, a PCD index was developed and validated for predicting AML OS. A prognostic nomogram was then generated and validated on the basis of the PCD index, age and ELN risk stratification in the Beat AML cohort and the GSE146173 cohort, revealing satisfactory predictive power (AUC values\u2009\u2265\u20090.7). With different mutation patterns, a higher PCD index was associated with a worse OS. The PCD index was significantly related to higher scores for immunosuppressive cells and mature leukemia cell subtypes. As the gene most closely related to the PCD index, the expression of SMAD3 was further validated in vitro. AML cells harboring KMT2A rearrangements were more sensitive to the SMAD3 inhibitor SIS3, and the expression of the autophagy-related molecular marker LC3 was increased in KMT2A-rearranged cell lines after SIS3 monotherapy and combined treatment. The PCD index and SMAD3 gene expression levels have potential prognostic value and can be used in targeted therapy for AML, and these findings can lead to the development of effective strategies for the combined treatment of high-risk AML patients.",

Introducing KDM5C mutation into two male and two female KDM5C wild-type ccRCC cell lines caused different phenotypes and non-overlapping transcriptional consequences, indicative of context-dependent functions of KDM5C. We identify that loss of the Y chromosome, harbouring the KDM5C homologue KDM5D, occurs in most male KDM5C mutant ccRCCs. Mutation of KDM5D in male 786-O cells prevented xenograft tumour formation and this phenotype was unexpectedly rescued by co-mutation of KDM5C, consistent with the co-occurrence of KDM5C mutation and loss of the Y chromosome in ccRCC. Transcriptional analyses showed that KDM5C and KDM5D regulate the expression of both overlapping as well as distinct sets of genes. While KDM5C and KDM5D bind to at least some overlapping genomic sites, gene expression changes induced by KDM5C or KDM5D mutation are apparently unrelated to the direct functions of these proteins at the relevant gene promoters or enhancers. Our findings identify similarities and differences in KDM5C and KDM5D functions, challenging the idea that KDM5D in male cells functions equivalently to the second KDM5C allele in female cells, and implicate an interplay between KDM5C mutation and Y chromosome loss in ccRCC development in men.",

The expression of tumor cell-intrinsic STING was significantly associated with worse prognosis in Fn-high EC patients. Exposure to Fn significantly activated the STING pathway in EC cells. RNA-seq analysis revealed that exposure to Fn markedly activated cytokine-chemokine-related signaling pathways and induced the expression of several cytokines and chemokines in STING-expressing EC cells. Among the differentially expressed cytokine and chemokine genes in EC cells co-cultured with Fn, analysis of TCGA datasets demonstrated that the expression of CCL20, CXCL10, and CSF2 may be associated with poor prognosis in EC patients.

While transcription master regulators induce lineage-specific genes to restrict plasticity, it remains unclear whether plasticity is actively suppressed by lineage-specific repressors.

We validated hepatocyte-specific candidates using reprogramming, revealing that prospero homeobox protein 1 (PROX1) enhanced hepatocyte identity by direct repression of alternative fate master regulators. In mice, Prox1 was required for efficient hepatocyte regeneration after injury and was sufficient to prevent liver tumorigenesis. In line with patient data, Prox1 depletion caused hepatocyte fate loss in vivo and enabled the transition of hepatocellular carcinoma to cholangiocarcinoma.

          "abstract": "TCGA has identified predominant somatic copy number alterations (SCNA) affecting numerous genes in HGSOC. To identify cancer-driver genes from the regions of SCNA, we have devised a scoring system that integrates information from different genetic alterations. Applying this scoring system to the TCGA-HGSOC dataset (n\u2009=\u2009316) we have identified several well-known and novel putative cancer genes in HGSOC. We functionally validated the roles of two previously unknown genes, RNF144B and PPP2R2A. RNF144B, an E3 ubiquitin-ligase is amplified and overexpressed in 16% of HGSOC (TCGA). Overexpression of RNF144B in ovarian cancer cells increased cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. RNF144B was significantly overexpressed in 50% of primary tumors from patients with HGSOC compared to the ovary. Further, it had significantly reduced expression in tumors after chemotherapy. PPP2R2A, the regulatory subunit of PP2A is deleted and downregulated in 38% of HGSOCs (TCGA). Overexpression of PPP2R2A inhibited cell proliferation, colony-formation, migration, and invasion in ovarian cancer cells. In OVCAR-5, which expresses low levels of PPP2R2A, Niraparib inhibited cell proliferation. PPP2R2A was not expressed in 72% of HGSOCs. This report demonstrates this approach to identifying genes from the TCGA data. Further experiments are required to conclusively prove the role of these genes in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer.",

Overexpression of CENP-A is observed in many cancers and this correlates with poor prognosis. Here, we show that altered stoichiometry of histone H3 and expression of oncohistone mutation H3 E97K contributes to mislocalization of Cse4 and CIN. Oncohistone mutations in the globular domain of histone H3 such as H3 E97K occur in several cancers; however, their functional effects remain unexplored. We demonstrated that strains with reduced gene dosage of histone H3 (hht1\u0394 and hht2\u0394) or oncohistone H3 E97K mutation exhibit enhanced Cse4-H4 interaction, an in vivo change in the conformational state of Cse4, and this contributes to mislocalization of Cse4. Oncohistone H3 E97K mutant protein was unstable and exhibited defects in interaction with histone H4. Notably, mislocalization of Cse4 and CIN phenotypes were observed in hht1\u0394 and oncohistone H3 E97K mutants expressing endogenous Cse4. In summary, our studies highlight the importance of histone H3 stoichiometry in preventing mislocalization of Cse4 for chromosomal stability and suggest that oncohistone H3 mutations may contribute to CIN in human cancers.",

Significant downregulation of SOX2 expression was observed in colorectal adenocarcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and testicular germ cell tumors, whereas its expression was upregulated in cervical squamous cell carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, lower grade glioma, lung adenocarcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma. Survival analysis showed that low SOX2 expression correlated with better prognosis in bladder cancer, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and sarcoma, whereas high SOX2 expression was associated with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, lower grade glioma. Although increased immune checkpoint expression is generally linked to poor prognosis, tumors with high SOX2 expression exhibited higher responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors, suggesting that targeting SOX2 may improve immune checkpoint therapy efficacy. The study highlights SOX2 as a key factor in cancer prognosis and immune infiltration across multiple tumor types. Its expression is closely associated with immune-related genes and may serve as both a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target. These findings underscore SOX2's potential in regulating immune checkpoints and enhancing cancer immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Development of cancer treatments such as antibody-based therapy relies on several factors across the drug-target axis, including the specificity of target expression and characterization of downstream signaling pathways. While existing tools for analyzing and visualizing transcriptomic data offer evaluation of individual gene-level expression, they lack a comprehensive assessment of pathway-guided analysis, relevant for single- and dual-targeting therapeutics. Here, we introduce VIBE (VIsualization of Bulk RNA Expression data), an R package which provides a thorough exploration of both individual and combined gene expression, supplemented by pathway-guided analyses. VIBE's versatility proves pivotal for disease stratification and therapeutic targeting in cancer and other diseases. VIBE offers a wide array of functions that streamline the visualization and analysis of transcriptomic data for single- and dual-targeting therapies. Its intuitive interface allows users to evaluate the expression of target genes and their associated pathways across various cancer indications, aiding in target and disease prioritization. Metadata, such as treatment or number of prior lines of therapy, can be easily incorporated to refine the identification of patient cohorts hypothesized to derive benefit from a given drug. We demonstrate how VIBE can be used to assist in indication selection and target identification in three user case studies using both simulated and real-world data. VIBE integrates statistics in all graphics, enabling data-informed decision-making. VIBE facilitates detailed visualization of individual and cohort-level summaries such as concordant or discordant expression of two genes or pathways. Such analyses can help to prioritize disease indications that are amenable to treatment strategies such as bispecific or monoclonal antibody therapies. With this tool, researchers can enhance indication selection and potentially accelerate the development of novel targeted therapies with the goal of precision, personalization, and ensuring treatments align with an individual patient's disease state across a spectrum of disorders.

          "abstract": "Tendomodulin (TNMD) is pivotal in various malignancies, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, its comprehensive impact across cancers, particularly its immunomodulatory function in CRC, remains underexplored. This study explored the role of TNMD in CRC by focusing on its immunomodulatory functions through comprehensive molecular and clinical analyses. Multiple bioinformatics databases and analytical tools were utilized for the TNMD in pan-cancer analysis. To validate the role of TNMD in CRC, we performed experiments, including immunofluorescence (IF), immunohistochemistry (IHC), real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qPCR), western blotting, and cell migration assays. TNMD expression and gene mutation vary across cancers and offer high diagnostic value. Survival analysis found that TNMD is associated with prognosis in multiple cancers. Notably, in patients with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) CRC, TNMD expression correlated positively with various immune cells, particularly natural killer (NK) cells, whereas it was inversely correlated with regulatory T cells (Tregs). Crucially, in patients with microsatellite stability (MSS) CRC, high TNMD expression was associated with better immunotherapy outcomes, indicating its potential as a biomarker for patient stratification and tailored treatment approaches. Furthermore, single-cell sequencing data revealed stronger interactions between TNMD-positive tumor cells and fibroblasts or macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Finally, TNMD was overexpressed in CRC tumor tissues and cell lines, thereby promoting invasion and metastasis. Our findings reveal a critical immunomodulatory role of TNMD in CRC, particularly in influencing tumor-immune interactions. Beyond its potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, TNMD promotes CRC metastasis and invasion, thus emerging as a promising therapeutic target. These findings highlight TNMD's significance in CRC and potentially other malignancies.",

While studies on DPH2 in a single cancer type have been documented, no comprehensive investigations of DPH2 across pan-cancer have been reported, its role in tumor pathogenesis and development remains unclear. The predictive significance and immune and biological roles of DPH2 in 33 different cancer types were investigated. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of DPH2 in pan-cancer using various bioinformatics tools, including expression, prognosis, its association with immune infiltration, cell death, methylation, and many other aspects. In addition, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry experiments confirmed DPH2 expression in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) tissues, DPH2 biological function in PRAD was assessed using in vitro experiments, and used immunofluorescence to validate the proteins associated with DPH2. The DPH2 expression was high in most tumors and showed significant correlations with OS and PFI. Our experimental findings confirmed that DPH2 is highly expressed in PRAD, while DPH2 knockdown inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Furthermore, our data suggest that DPH2 may significantly influence immune cell infiltration. DPH2 was significantly correlated with cell death-related genes. DPH2 can influence cancer progression through changes in DNA methylation levels, or N6-methyladenosine site modification. GSEA and GSVA revealed that DPH2 levels were significantly associated with enrichment for oncogenic and immune-related pathways. Drug sensitivity analysis revealed that the elevated DPH2 expression is linked to development of resistance against numerous anticancer medications. DPH2 has potential as a novel prognostic biomarker that may significantly impact tumor onset and progression. Consequently, DPH2 could serve as a target for new cancer treatments.",

Anoikis, a process of programmed cell death that occurs when cells detach from the extracellular matrix, is closely associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. In this study, we used the TCGA-STAD database to identify the expression patterns and prognostic relevance of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in STAD. Functional enrichment analysis was used to explore the potential pathway. LASSO and Cox regression were used to construct anoikis-related prognostic signature. The anoikis risk score (ARS) incorporated 7 genes and stratified patients into highand low-risk subgroups by median value splitting. In addition, external validation was performed based on GSE66229, GSE15459, and GSE84437 cohorts. Nomograms were created based on risk characteristics in combination with clinical variants and the performance of the model was validated with time-dependent AUC, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The prognostic signature indicated that the low-risk subgroup had better outcomes and significant correlations with tumor microenvironment, immune landscape, immunotherapy response, and drug sensitivity. In addition, single-cell analysis displayed the cell types, the subcellular localization of prognostic genes, and the cellular interaction to reveal the potential molecular communication mechanism of anoikis resistance. Finally, in vitro experiments confirmed the critical role of CRABP2 in STAD. The results indicated that CRABP2 knockdown inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis. In summary, ARS can serve as a biomarker for predicting survival outcomes in STAD patients, providing new tools for personalized treatment decisions for STAD patients.",

ZC3H12D, which belongs to the family of CCCH-type zinc finger-containing proteins, is a negative regulator with a key function in immune modulation. However, it is still unclear how ZC3H12D affects the immune infiltration and prognosis of HNSCC. In this study, the data obtained from various databases were used to assess ZC3H12D expression in HNSCC and in various tumors under the HNSCC classification. The association between clinical features and ZC3H12D expression in HNSCC was evaluated using the UALCAN database. Additionally, a ROC curve was employed to analyze the diagnostic value of ZC3H12D. The effect of ZC3H12D on prognosis was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox analysis, and the nomogram model. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were employed to investigate the underlying role of ZC3H12D in HNSCC. The association between ZC3H12D expression and the tumor microenvironment and immune checkpoints were investigated by TIMER2 and Tumor Immune Single Cell Hub 2 databases and various packages in R. The findings demonstrated a significant up-regulation of ZC3H12D expression in HNSCC, while ZC3H12D expression was found to be associated with clinical parameters. Our study also demonstrated that ZC3H12D could act as a potential prognostic biomarker for HNSCC, especially oral squamous cell carcinoma. Additional analyses have shown that ZC3H12D was associated with common immune checkpoint genes and may be related to immune infiltration in HNSCC.",

We initially confirmed the correlation of the expression of these genes in colon cancer tissues from patients (n=105) and reported that <i>TTC7B</i> downregulation was significantly associated with poor prognosis. We subsequently performed a series of biological experiments and demonstrated that TTC7B upregulated RXRA expression probably through the PI4KA-mediated AKT1 pathway and that RXRA was a transcription factor for the <i>FTO</i> gene. TTC7B inhibited the proliferation of colon cancer cells by increasing the recruitment of RXRA to the <i>FTO</i> promoter, increasing <i>FTO</i> expression, and decreasing the total RNA m6A level. Ablation of <i>FTO</i> demethylase activity completely abolished the inhibitory effect of <i>TTC7B</i> on the proliferation of cancer cells <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. In conclusion, our study demonstrated for the first time that TTC7B triggers the RXRA-FTO axis through PI4KA binding, which leads to a decrease in total RNA m6A modification and the inhibition of colon cancer progression.",

Here, we characterize over 25 genetically-defined organoid models derived from murine and human oral/esophageal tissues harboring key driver mutations. Double knockout of <i>TP53</i> and <i>CDKN2A</i> induced morphological dysplasia, hyperproliferation, loss of squamous differentiation, and tumorigenicity, which were further exacerbated by additional driver mutations (e.g., <i>PIK3CA</i>, <i>NOTCH1</i>, <i>KMT2C</i>). Single-cell analysis revealed an expansion of quiescent basal cells and proliferative squamous cells, alongside a loss of differentiated squamous cells during malignant transformation. A distinct senescence program, regulated by ANXA1, was markedly diminished during early neoplastic evolution. Mechanistically, the ANXA1-SMAD3-p27<sup>KIP1</sup> pathway was identified as a critical regulator of this senescence program, acting to suppress neoplastic features in organoid models. Lastly, our high-throughput, single-organoid-resolution drug screens unexpectedly revealed <i>PIK3CA</i>-driven organoids exhibited sensitivity to Mitomycin C and Onalespib. This study provides novel mechanistic insights into early neoplastic evolution and underscores the value of genetically-defined organoid models for investigating cancer biology and identifying targeted therapies.",

          "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer globally, with limited effective biomarkers and sensitive therapeutic targets. An increasing number of studies have highlighted the critical role of tumor microenvironment (TME) imbalances, particularly immune escape due to impaired chemokine-mediated trafficking, in tumorigenesis and progression. Notably, CC chemokines (CCLs) have been shown to either promote or inhibit angiogenesis, metastasis, and immune responses in tumors, thereby influencing cancer development and patient outcomes. However, the diagnostic and prognostic significance of CCLs in CRC remains unclear. In this study, multiple online tools for bioinformatics analyses were utilized. The findings revealed that the mRNA expression levels of CCL3, CCL4, and CCL26 were significantly elevated in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues, whereas CCL2, CCL5, CCL11, CCL21, and CCL28 mRNA levels were markedly downregulated. Additionally, dysregulation of CCL4, CCL5, and CCL21 was strongly associated with clinical staging, and elevated levels of CCL4, CCL11, and CCL28 were linked to significantly prolonged survival in CRC patients. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the cellular roles of CCLs were predominantly associated with the chemokine, Wnt, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways, as well as protein kinase activity. Furthermore, transcriptional regulation of most CCLs involved RELA and NFKB1. Key downstream targets included members of the SRC family of tyrosine kinases (HCK, LYN, and LCK), serine/threonine kinases (ATR and ATM), and others such as CSNK1G2, NEK2, and CDK2. Moreover, CCLs (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL11, CCL21, and CCL28) exhibited strong correlations with major infiltration-related immune cells, including B cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. In conclusion, our study provides novel insights into the potential utility of CCLs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for CRC prevention and immunotherapy.",

However, the factors influencing cancer cell sensitivity and resistance to MEK inhibition remain poorly understood. In our study, we observed that MEK inhibition significantly reduced the expression of MYC, a transcription factor critical for the therapeutic response. MYC overexpression markedly enhanced the sensitivity of HNSCC cells to trametinib, as evidenced by delayed wound healing and reduced colony formation. Cell cycle analysis revealed that trametinib induced a G1 phase arrest, whereas MYC overexpression accelerated cell cycle progression, with a reduced induction of p27 and p21 and diminished decreases in E2F1 and phospho-Ser2/5 levels. Flow cytometry and protein analyses demonstrated that MYC overexpression amplified trametinib-induced apoptosis and DNA damage, as evidenced by elevated levels of pro-apoptotic markers (p53, cleaved PARP, and BIM) and \u03b3H2AX. In vivo xenograft models confirmed these findings, showing increased sensitivity to trametinib in MYC-overexpressing tumors. Moreover, MEK inhibition increased autophagy in HNSCC cells, a factor critical for therapeutic resistance. Inhibiting trametinib-induced autophagy further enhanced apoptotic cell death. These findings suggest that MYC expression and autophagy play crucial roles in HNSCC's response to MEK inhibition. Combining trametinib with autophagy inhibition may improve therapeutic outcomes in HNSCC.",

          "abstract": "Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children, typically arising during infancy and childhood. Despite multimodal therapies achieving a response rate of 70% in children older than 3 years, treatment remains challenging. Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death, can be induced in medulloblastoma cells in vitro using erastin or RSL3. Using two independent medulloblastoma RNA-sequencing cohorts (MB-PBTA and MTAB-10767), we investigated the expression of ferroptosis-related molecules through multiple approaches, including Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), molecular subtype stratification, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and univariable and multivariable overall survival analyses. A prognostic expression score was computed based on a cross-validated ferroptosis signature. In training and validation cohorts, the regulation of the ferroptosis transcriptional program distinguished the four molecular subtypes of medulloblastoma. WGCNA identified nine gene modules in the MB tumor transcriptome; five correlated with molecular subtypes, implicating pathways related to oxidative stress, hypoxia, and trans-synaptic signaling. One module, associated with disease recurrence, included epigenetic regulators and nucleosome organizers. Univariable survival analyses identified a 45-gene ferroptosis prognostic signature associated with nutrient sensing, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and trans-sulfuration within a one-carbon metabolism. The top ten unfavorable ferroptosis genes included <i>CCT3</i>, <i>SNX5</i>, <i>SQOR</i>, <i>G3BP1</i>, <i>CARS1</i>, <i>SLC39A14</i>, <i>FAM98A</i>, <i>FXR1</i>, <i>TFAP2C</i>, and <i>ATF4</i>. Patients with a high ferroptosis score showed a worse prognosis, particularly in the G3 and SHH subtypes. The PPI network highlighted IL6 and CBS as unfavorable hub genes. In a multivariable overall survival model, which included gender, age, and the molecular subtype classification, the ferroptosis expression score was validated as an independent adverse prognostic marker (hazard ratio: 5.8; <i>p</i>-value = 1.04 \u00d7 10<sup>-9</sup>). This study demonstrates that the regulation of the ferroptosis transcriptional program is linked to medulloblastoma molecular subtypes and patient prognosis. A cross-validated ferroptosis signature was identified in two independent RNA-sequencing cohorts, and the ferroptosis score was confirmed as an independent and adverse prognostic factor in medulloblastoma.",

We sought to deconvolute the attention feature learnt by a deep learning convolutional neural networks trained with whole-slide images (WSIs) of hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E)-stained tumor samples using spatial transcriptomic data. In this study, 773 WSIs of H&E-stained tumor sections from 335 patients with treatment na\u00efve high-grade serous ovarian cancer who were included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan-Cancer study were used to train, and validate, and to test a ResNet101 CNN model modified with attention mechanism. WSIs from patients in an independent cohort were used to further evaluate the model. The prognostic value of the predicted H&E-based survival scores from the trained model on patient survival was evaluated. The attention signals learnt by the model were then examined their correlation with immune signatures using spatial transcriptome. After validating the model with the testing datasets, pathway enrichment analysis showed that the H&E-based survival score significantly correlated with certain immune signatures and this was validated spatially using spatial transcriptome data generated from ovarian cancer FFPE samples by correlating the selected signature and attention signal. In conclusion, attention mechanism might be useful to identify regions for their specific immune activities. This could guide future pathological study for the useful immunological features that are important in modulating the prognosis of ovarian cancer patients.",

Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC) gene expression is known to be regulated by neuronal activity. Therefore, we studied the clinical relevance of ARC gene expression as a surrogate of neuronal activity in BC. Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network - Breast (SCAN-B (GSE96058), n = 3,273) cohort and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n = 1,069) were analyzed. High ARC expression was significantly associated with smaller tumor size, without lymph node metastasis, and less stage IV disease in one cohort, but not validated by the other. Estrogen receptor-positive (ER<sup>+</sup>)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2<sup>-</sup>) and luminal A expressed significantly higher ARC compared to the other subtypes in both cohorts (P < 0.005). High ARC BC was significantly associated with lower Nottingham histological grade and lower Ki67 gene expression consistently in ER<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> but not triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) in both cohorts (P < 0.001). Cell proliferation-related gene sets in the Hallmark collection (E2F targets, G2M checkpoint, and mitotic spindle) were significantly enriched to low ARC BC in ER<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> but not TNBC in TCGA. The stromal cells (fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, and adipocytes) were all significantly infiltrated in high ARC ER<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup>, but not in TNBC, except for neurons.

          "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) is a key inducer of angiogenesis, responsible for generating new blood vessels in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and facilitating metastasis. Notably, Avastin, which targets VEGFA, failed to demonstrate any significant benefit in clinical trials for breast cancer (BC). This study aimed to investigate the clinical relevance of <i>VEGFA</i> gene expression in BC. A total of 7,336 BC patients across eight independent cohorts: ISPY2 (GSE173839), Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network-Breast (SCAN-B) (GSE96058), Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC), GSE25066, GSE163882, GSE34138, GSE20194, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), were analyzed. The calculated median <i>VEGFA</i> expression level was used to stratify these cohorts into high and low groups. High <i>VEGFA</i> was associated with worse disease-free, disease-specific, and overall survival in the METABRIC cohort, with findings supported by the SCAN-B cohort, which also showed worse overall survival (all P < 0.02). High <i>VEGFA</i> expression was seen in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) but not in BC with lymph node metastasis. Additionally, there was a significant correlation between high <i>VEGFA</i> expression and higher silent and non-silent mutations, single-nucleotide variant (SNV) neoantigens, homologous recombination defect, intratumoral heterogeneity, in the TCGA cohort. In the TCGA, METABRIC, and SCAN-B cohorts, high <i>VEGFA</i> BC was also associated with higher cell proliferation: higher Ki67 gene expression, higher Nottingham histological grade, and consistent enrichment of all the Hallmark cell proliferation-related gene sets. Unexpectedly, the angiogenesis gene set was not enriched in any of the cohorts and showed no association with infiltrations of lymphatic or blood vascular endothelial cells besides pericytes. High <i>VEGFA</i> BC had significantly less infiltration of anti-cancer immune cells but higher infiltration of pro-cancer immune cells in TCGA, METABRIC, and SCAN-B cohorts. Interestingly, BC, which had a pathological complete response (pCR) after anthracycline- and taxane-based neoadjuvant therapy, was associated with significantly heightened <i>VEGFA</i> expression in both estrogen receptor (ER)+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)- and TNBC subtypes in the GSE25066 cohort and after immunotherapy in ER+/ HER2- subtype, but not TNBC in the ISPY2 cohort. Our research indicates that high <i>VEGFA</i> BC confers high cell proliferation, reduced immune cell infiltration, and poorer survival, but allows better response to anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.",

Previously, studies of the Lmo2 transgenic mouse model of ETP-ALL identified a population of stem-like T-cell progenitors with long-term self-renewal capacity and intrinsic chemotherapy resistance linked to cellular quiescence. Here, analyses of Lmo2 transgenic mice, patient-derived xenografts, and single-cell RNA-sequencing data from primary ETP-ALL identified a rare subpopulation of leukemic stem cells expressing high levels of the cytokine receptor FLT3. Despite a highly proliferative state, these FLT3-overexpressing cells had long-term self-renewal capacity and almost complete resistance to chemotherapy. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing demonstrated FLT3 and its ligand may be direct targets of the LMO2 stem-cell complex. Media conditioned by Lmo2 transgenic thymocytes revealed an autocrine FLT3-dependent signaling loop that could be targeted by the FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib. Consequently, gilteritinib impaired in vivo growth of ETP-ALL and improved the sensitivity to chemotherapy. Furthermore, gilteritinib enhanced response to the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax, which may enable \"chemo-free\" treatment of ETP-ALL. Together, these data provide a cellular and molecular explanation for enhanced cytokine signaling in LMO2-driven ETP-ALL beyond activating mutations and a rationale for clinical trials of FLT3 inhibitors in ETP-ALL.",

          "abstract": "EGFR is a highly expressed driver of many cancers, yet the utility of EGFR inhibitors (EGFRi) is limited to cancers that harbor sensitizing mutations in the EGFR gene because of dose-limiting toxicities. Rather than conventionally blocking the kinase activity of EGFR, we sought to reduce its transcription as an alternative approach to broaden the therapeutic window for EGFR inhibitors targeting wild-type (WT) or mutant EGFR. We found that YES1 is highly expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and drives cell growth by elevating EGFR levels. Mechanistically, YES1 stimulates EGFR expression by signaling to JNK and stabilizing the AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun. This effect extends beyond TNBC as YES1 also sustains EGFR expression in non-small cell lung cancer cells, including those that harbor the EGFR gatekeeper mutation T790M. The novel ability of YES1 to regulate the expression of WT and mutant EGFR mRNA and protein provides a potential therapeutic opportunity of utilizing YES1 blockade to broadly increase the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors. Indeed, we observed synergy within in vitro and in vivo models of TNBC and non-small cell lung cancer, even in the absence of EGFR-activating mutations. Together, these data provide a rationale for blocking YES1 activity as an approach for improving the efficacy of EGFR-targeting drugs in cancers that have generally been refractory to such inhibitors. Implications: YES1 sustains EGFR expression, revealing a therapeutic vulnerability for increasing the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors by lowering the threshold for efficacy in tumors driven by the WT or mutant receptor.",

Pan-TRK antibody, which shows the overexpression of the <i>NTRK1-2-3</i> genes, is a useful tool to detect tumors with or without <i>NTRK</i> gene alterations, due to high negative predictive value. Though it is well known that pan-TRK immunopositivity is usually not connected to <i>NTRK</i> fusion, the role of other possible genetic alterations is under-researched. In our previous work, we found 3 <i>NTRK1</i> amplified cases out of 6 cases with recurrent <i>NTRK1</i> tyrosine kinase domain mutation pair, so we extended our investigation to a larger series to estimate amplification frequency. Pan-TRK immunopositivity was seen in 76 of the 132 dedifferentiated liposarcomas cases, followed by <i>NTRK1-2-3</i> break-apart FISH tests in 76 pan-TRK positive cases to detect oncogenic fusions or other copy number alterations of these genes. None of the pan-TRK immunopositive dedifferentiated liposarcomas showed absolutely certain sign of fusion, however, 18 (28%) cases showed amplification of one of the genes, 13 had polysomy, 34 were normal, 11 were not evaluable. The extent of pan-TRK immunoreaction showed a positive correlation (p = 0.002) with the <i>NTRK</i> status found by FISH. Analyzing publicly available data from large series of 265 liposarcoma samples consisting of both well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma case, 23 (8.6%) cases showed a mutual exclusive amplification of the <i>NTRK</i> genomic loci in a non-preselected, independent patient population indicating that our findings are presented in other cohorts.

          "abstract": "Comprehensively mapping the hierarchical structure of breast cancer protein communities and identifying potential biomarkers from them is a promising way for breast cancer research. Existing approaches are subjective and fail to take information from protein sequences into consideration. Deep learning can automatically learn features from protein sequences and protein-protein interactions for hierarchical clustering. Using a large amount of publicly available proteomics data, we created a hierarchical tree for breast cancer protein communities using a novel hierarchical graph neural network, with the supervision of gene ontology terms and assistance of a pre-trained deep contextual language model. Then, a group-lasso algorithm was applied to identify protein communities that are under both mutation burden and survival burden, undergo significant alterations when targeted by specific drug molecules, and show cancer-dependent perturbations. The resulting hierarchical map of protein communities shows how gene-level mutations and survival information converge on protein communities at different scales. Internal validity of the model was established through the convergence on BRCA2 as a breast cancer hotspot. Further overlaps with breast cancer cell dependencies revealed SUPT6H and RAD21, along with their respective protein systems, HOST:37 and HOST:861, as potential biomarkers. Using gene-level perturbation data of the HOST:37 and HOST:861 gene sets, three FDA-approved drugs with high therapeutic value were selected as potential treatments to be further evaluated. These drugs include mercaptopurine, pioglitazone, and colchicine. The proposed graph neural network approach to analyzing breast cancer protein communities in a hierarchical structure provides a novel perspective on breast cancer prognosis and treatment. By targeting entire gene sets, we were able to evaluate the prognostic and therapeutic value of genes (or gene sets) at different levels, from gene-level to system-level biology. Cancer-specific gene dependencies provide additional context for pinpointing cancer-related systems and drug-induced alterations can highlight potential therapeutic targets. These identified protein communities, in conjunction with other protein communities under strong mutation and survival burdens, can potentially be used as clinical biomarkers for breast cancer.",

          "abstract": "Combination therapy with antiangiogenic drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown enhanced clinical activity and has been approved for the treatment of multiple tumor types. Despite extensive research, predictive biomarkers for combination therapy remain poorly understood. Microvessel density (MVD), a surrogate marker for aberrant angiogenesis measured by IHC, has been associated with response to monotherapy with antiangiogenic inhibitors. However, obtaining tumor tissue with a sufficient mass for IHC analysis is not always practical, and IHC-based MVD measurements are unavailable in large public datasets. In this study, we developed an MVD gene score based on RNA sequencing data that reflects MVD by using RNA sequencing and MVD measured by IHC in 12 mouse syngeneic tumor models. We explored the relationship between the MVD gene score and a gene signature, predicting the response to anti\u2013PD-1 therapy in mouse and human tumor datasets. The MVD gene score correlated with the antitumor activity of lenvatinib, a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor mainly targeting VEGFRs and FGFRs, in mouse tumor models, and MVD measured by IHC in commercially available human formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples. Tumor types in The Cancer Genome Atlas were classified into four subgroups based on the MVD gene score and T cell\u2013inflamed gene expression profile, which were correlated with clinical indications for treatment. In conclusion, the newly developed MVD gene score enables the estimation of MVD in large public datasets in which IHC data are unavailable and has potential clinical utility together with the T cell\u2013inflamed gene expression profile to characterize tumors of patients for precision medicine. A novel gene signature for MVD was developed. This MVD gene score enables the estimation of MVD, reflecting the sensitivity to antiangiogenic inhibitors, in transcriptomic datasets. We demonstrated the utility of the MVD gene score together with a T cell-inflamed gene signature for potential future use as a clinical biomarker.",

          "abstract": "Accurate identification and prioritization of driver-mutations in cancer is critical for effective patient management. Despite the presence of numerous bioinformatic algorithms for estimating mutation pathogenicity, there is significant variation in their assessments. This inconsistency is evident even for well-established cancer driver mutations. This study aims to develop an ensemble machine learning approach to evaluate the performance (rank) of pathogenic and conservation scoring algorithms (PCSAs) based on their ability to distinguish pathogenic driver mutations from benign passenger (non-driver) mutations in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC). The study used a dataset from 502 HNSC patients, classifying mutations based on 299 known high-confidence cancer driver genes. Missense somatic mutations in driver genes were treated as driver mutations, while non-driver mutations were randomly selected from other genes. Each mutation was annotated with 41 PCSAs. Three machine learning algorithms-logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine-along with recursive feature elimination, were used to rank these PCSAs. The final ranking of the PCSAs was determined using rank-average-sort and rank-sum-sort methods. The random forest algorithm emerged as the top performer among the three tested ML algorithms, with an AUC-ROC of 0.89, compared to 0.83 for the other two, in distinguishing pathogenic driver mutations from benign passenger mutations using all 41 PCSAs. The top 11 PCSAs were selected based on the first quintile cut-off from the final rank-sum distribution. Classifiers built using these top 11 PCSAs (DEOGEN2, Integrated_fitCons, MVP, etc.) demonstrated significantly higher performance (p-value\u2009<\u20092.22e-16) compared to those using the remaining 30 PCSAs across all three ML algorithms, in separating pathogenic driver from benign passenger mutations. The top PCSAs demonstrated strong performance on a validation cohort including independent HNSC and other cancer types: breast, lung, and colorectal - reflecting its consistency, robustness and generalizability. The ensemble machine learning approach effectively evaluates the performance of PCSAs based on their ability to differentiate pathogenic drivers from benign passenger mutations in HNSC and other cancer types. Notably, some well-known PCSAs performed poorly, underscoring the importance of data-driven selection over relying solely on popularity.",

FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a frequently mutated gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, its role in solid cancers remains poorly understood. We analyzed the frequency of FLT3 alterations, its mRNA expression levels, and its prognostic implications across multiple cancer types. Additionally, we explored genes co-expressed with FLT3 and performed gene ontology analysis to identify associated biological processes. We also examined the relationship between FLT3 expression and markers of various immune cells, tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, we validated these findings in our own cohort of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. We found that FLT3 alteration and expression were both significantly upregulated in AML and were associated with poor prognosis, which is opposite to its role in solid cancers. The genes co-expressed with FLT3 in solid cancers were correlated with the regulation of the immune microenvironment. FLT3 was positively correlated with the formation of TLSs in only solid cancers, which was especially relevant to central memory T cells. We also found that FLT3 was positively correlated with the infiltration of NK cells, B cells, and DCs. It also positively correlated with the occurrence of apoptosis in solid cancers, but exhibited opposite roles in AML. The structural factors of the TLSs were positively correlated with FLT3 in solid cancers, but exhibited a negative correlation in AML. Meanwhile, we further validated the above conclusions in our own HCC cohort and demonstrated that FLT3 could serve as a predictive indicator of PD-1 treatment efficacy in HCC. In summary, the role of FLT3 is different in AML and solid cancers. FLT3 is associated with dendritic cell infiltration, tertiary lymphoid structure construction, and predict response to checkpoint inhibitors immunotherapy in HCC.",

This study aimed to elucidate the role of CENPN in human cancers and evaluate its prognostic significance. Investigate the role of CENPN in various malignancies, we leveraged data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases. We employed a comprehensive suite of web platforms and software tools for data analysis, including R, Cytoscape, an integrated repository portal for tumor-immune system interactions (TISIDB), CBio Cancer Genomics Portal (cBioPortal), Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interaction Gene/Proteins (STRING), Gene Set Cancer Analysis (GSCALite), and a cancer single-cell state atlas (CancerSEA). The findings demonstrated that CENPN expression was elevated in the majority of cancer types and differentially expressed across molecular and immune subtypes. Functional enrichment analysis in multiple tumors also identified possible pathways of CENPN involvement in tumorigenesis. Its expression positively correlated with Th2 and Tcm cells in most cancers. It is also correlated with genetic markers of immunomodulators in various cancers. Overall, CENPN expression is closely related to cancers and has the potential to act as a cancer biomarker.",

We also found that cervical cancers caused by HPV types outside of phylogenetic clade \u03b19 had a higher recurrence frequency than those caused by \u03b19 types in both our study and The Cancer Genome Atlas cervical cancer database, despite the higher prevalence of \u03b19 types including HPV16 in cervical cancer.

          "abstract": "Type 2 deiodinase (D2), encoded by DIO2 gene, catalyzes the activation of the prohormone thyroxine (T4) into the bioactive hormone triiodothyronine (T3) in peripheral tissues, thereby regulating the intracellular Thyroid Hormone (TH) availability. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that a drastic increase in the peripheral activation of TH, via D2, fosters tumor progression, metastasis, and immunity. To further prove the clinical relevance of D2 in human cancer, based on public Database of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we conducted a pan-cancer analysis of DIO2 expression in various cancer types and investigated the association of DIO2 expression with the tumor microenvironment (TME) components and immune cell infiltration, along with the DIO2 genetic alteration types. Although with different expression levels between the various cancer types, the pan-cancer analysis showed that DIO2 was highly expressed in most tumors and related to the progression of some tumor types. Furthermore, DIO2 expression was also significantly correlated with TME components, immune cell infiltration, and immunoinhibitory and immunostimulatory gene subsets. The relevance of this study is that it adds a clinical relevance to the recent demonstrations that D2 accelerates tumor invasion in animal models and poses DIO2 gene as a potential prognostic marker in various human cancers.",

          "abstract": "HER2-positive (+) breast cancer is an aggressive disease with poor prognosis, a narrative that changed drastically with the advent and approval of trastuzumab, the first humanized monoclonal antibody targeting HER2. In addition to another monoclonal antibody, more classes of HER2-targeted agents, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and antibody-drug conjugates were developed in the years that followed. While these potent therapies have substantially improved the outcome of patients with HER2+ breast cancer, resistance has prevailed as a clinical challenge ever since the arrival of targeted agents. Efforts to develop new treatment regimens to treat/overcome resistance is futile without a primary understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of resistance. Resistance could be attributed to mechanisms that are either specific to the tumor epithelial cells or those that emerge through changes in the tumor microenvironment. Reactivation of the HER receptor layer due to incomplete blockade of the HER receptor layer or due to alterations in the HER receptors is one of the major mechanisms. In other instances, resistance may occur due to deregulations in key downstream signaling such as the PI3K/AKT or RAS/MEK/ERK pathways or due to the emergence of compensatory pathways such as ER, other RTKs, or metabolic pathways. Potent new targeted agents and approaches to target key actionable drivers of resistance have already been identified, many of which are in early clinical development or under preclinical evaluation. Ongoing and future translational research will continue to uncover additional therapeutic vulnerabilities, as well as new targeted agents and approaches to treat and/or overcome anti-HER2 treatment resistance.",

Several strategies regarding CDK4/6i combinations or continuation beyond progression have been successfully evaluated in the metastatic setting, and are considered a standard of care. Mechanism of action of and resistance mechanisms against CDK4/6i in addition to endocrine resistance represent an important research topic, important for the treatment of HR+ breast cancer. Clinically, CDK4/6i are efficient substances that are usually well tolerated. However, side effects differing between the substances have been reported, and might lead to treatment discontinuation, including in the early disease setting. In the adjuvant setting, the addition of palbociclib to standard endocrine treatment has not improved outcomes, whereas large randomized phase III trials have demonstrated significant disease-free survival benefit for the addition of ribociclib (NATALEE trial) and abemaciclib (monarchE trial). Patient selection, treatment duration, endocrine backbone therapy, and other study details differ between these pivotal trials. This review focuses on both the scientific background as well as all available clinical data of CDK4/6i, with particular emphasis on their use in early breast cancer.",

Our study investigates the role of SIRT7 depletion in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) progression. In vitro and 3D organotypic models demonstrated that SIRT7 knock-out attenuates cancer cell viability, proliferation, and motility as well as induces downregulation of migration- and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related gene expression. Moreover, the SIRT7 loss results in slower organoid formation and less invasive organoid morphology, validated by vimentin downregulation. The SIRT7 loss potentiates S-phase arrest in cell cycle progression after 5-FU treatment and elevates the ratio of dead cells. Additionally, SIRT7 deletion reduces the expression of G1 phase-associated proteins, Cyclin D and CDK4. Altogether, our study highlights SIRT7 as a promising therapeutic target in HNSCC, enhancing the effectiveness of treatment modalities such as combinational treatment.",

          "abstract": "Invasive breast cancer (BC) is a highly life-threatening disease affecting women world-wide. While its early identification may benefit the provision of more effective therapies, several BC-associated factors may influence BC patients' therapeutic outcomes. Therefore, identifying novel prognostic and therapeutic targets for invasive BC can help with accurate prognosis and therapy-related decisions. The BRI3 binding protein (<i>BRI3BP</i>) gene was found to be a principal gene in invasive BC cohorts using artificial neural network (ANN) techniques. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the clinicopathological significance of BRI3BP at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels in invasive BC. Two transcriptomic BC cohorts, the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC; n=1,980) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n=854), were used to evaluate BRI3BP expression at the mRNA level. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from an invasive BC cohort (n=100) were also used to evaluate BRI3BP expression at the protein level via immunohistochemistry. The association between BRI3BP expression, clinicopathological characteristics, and patient outcomes was evaluated. In both METABRIC and TCGA cohorts, high expression of <i>BRI3BP</i> was significantly associated with aggressive tumor features such as high histological grade, large tumor size, and lymph vascular invasion (LVI) positivity. At the protein level, high BRI3BP expression was associated with high histological grade, hormone receptor negativity, high expression of Ki67, and poor outcome. This study revealed the prognostic significance of BRI3BP in invasive BC patients. Further functional assessment is needed to confirm the biological role of BRI3BP in BC.",

          "abstract": "Why cancer cells disproportionately accumulate polyubiquitinated proteotoxic proteins despite high proteasomal activity is an outstanding question. While mis-regulated ubiquitination is a contributing factor, here we show that a structurally-perturbed and sub-optimally functioning proteasome is at the core of altered proteostasis in tumors. By integrating the gene coexpression signatures of proteasomal subunits in breast cancer (BrCa) patient tissues with the atomistic details of 26S holocomplex, we find that the transcriptional deregulation induced-stoichiometric imbalances perpetuate with disease severity. As seen in luminal BrCa cell lines, this imbalance limits the number of double-capped 19S-20S-19S holocomplexes (30S) formed and promotes free 20S catalytic core accumulation that is widely-believed to confer survival advantage to tumors. By retaining connectivity with key tumor 19S:20S interface nodes, the PSMD9 19S subunit chaperone emerges as a crucial regulator of 26S/30S:20S ratios sustaining tumor cell proteasome function. Disrupting this connectivity by depleting PSMD9 in MCF7 cells introduces structural anomalies in the proteasome, and\u00a0shifts dependence from 20S<sup>High</sup> to a deregulated 26S<sup>High</sup> state invoking anti-tumor responses which opens up clinically-relevant therapeutic possibilities.",

          "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy has transformed metastatic cancer treatment, yet challenges persist regarding therapeutic efficacy. RECQL4, a RecQ-like helicase, plays a central role in DNA replication and repair as part of the DNA damage response, a pathway implicated in enhancing efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies. However, its role in patient response to ICI remains unclear. We analysed whole exome and bulk RNA sequencing data from a pan-cancer cohort of 25\u00a0775 patients and cutaneous melanoma cohorts (untreated: n\u00a0=\u00a0471, anti-progressive disease [PD]-1 treated: n\u00a0=\u00a0212). RECQL4 copy number variations and expression levels were assessed for patient outcomes. We performed gene set enrichment analysis to identify RECQL4-dependent signalling pathways and explored the association between RECQL4 levels and immunoscores. We evaluated the interplay of ICI response and RECQL4 expression in melanoma cohorts of 95 responders and 85 non-responders prior to and after ICI-targeted therapy and tested the prognostic power of RECQL4. Finally, we generated genetically engineered RECQL4 variants and conducted comprehensive multi-omic profiling, employing techniques such as liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, to elucidate mechanistic insights. We identified RECQL4 as a critical negative regulator of poor prognosis and response to ICI therapy, but also demonstrated its suitability as an independent biomarker in melanoma. High tumour purity and limited signatures of tumour immunogenicity associated with response to anti-PD-1 correlated with high RECQL4 activity. We found alterations in the secretion profile of immune regulatory factors and immune-related pathways robustly suppressed in tumours with high RECQL4 levels, underscoring its crucial role in fostering immune evasion. Mechanistically, we identified RECQL4-mediated regulation of major histocompatibility complex class II molecule expression and uncovered class II major histocompatibility complex transactivator as a mediator bridging this regulation. Our findings unraveled the pivotal role of RECQL4 in immune modulation and its potential as both a predictive biomarker and therapeutic target for optimising immunotherapeutic strategies across various cancer types. High RECQL4 expression limits survival and can act as an independent prognostic factor in melanoma patients. RECQL4 has the potential to act as a negative feedback mediator of immune checkpoint-targeted therapy by limiting signatures associated with therapeutic efficacy. RECQL4 favours an immune-evasive phenotype by downregulating major histocompatibility complex class II molecules.",

          "abstract": "Acquisition of genomic mutations enables cancer cells to gain fitness advantages under selective pressure and, ultimately, leads to oncogenic transformation. Interestingly, driver mutations, even within the same gene, can yield distinct phenotypes and clinical outcomes, necessitating a mutation-focused approach. Conversely, cellular functions are governed by molecular machines and signalling networks that are mostly controlled by protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The functional impact of individual genomic alterations could be transmitted through regulated nodes and hubs of PPIs. Oncogenic mutations may lead to modified residues of proteins, enabling interactions with other proteins that the wild-type protein does not typically interact with, or preventing interactions with proteins that the wild-type protein usually interacts with. This can result in the rewiring of molecular signalling cascades and the acquisition of an oncogenic phenotype. Here, we review the altered PPIs driven by oncogenic mutations, discuss technologies for monitoring PPIs and provide a functional analysis of mutation-directed PPIs. These driver mutation-enabled PPIs and mutation-perturbed PPIs present a new paradigm for the development of tumour-specific therapeutics. The intersection of cancer variants and altered PPI interfaces represents a new frontier for understanding oncogenic rewiring and developing tumour-selective therapeutic strategies.",

The combinatorial benefit depended on ALK1-mediated modulation of the differentiation potential of bone marrow-derived granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, the release of CD14+ monocytes into circulation, and their eventual extravasation. Notably, ACVRL1+ TAMs coincided with an immunosuppressive phenotype and were overrepresented in human cancers progressing on therapy. Accordingly, breast cancer patients with a prominent ACVRL1hi TAM signature exhibited a significantly shorter survival. In conclusion, we shed light on an unexpected multimodal regulation of tumorigenic phenotypes by ALK1 and demonstrate its utility as a target for antiangiogenic immunotherapy.",

Twenty-two of the 240 assayed MAX point mutations enhance selectivity, yet none of these mutations occur at residues that contact nucleotides in published structures. By applying thermodynamic and kinetic models to these results and previous observations for the highly similar yet far more selective TF Pho4 (S. cerevisiae), we find that these mutations enhance selectivity by altering partitioning between or affinity within conformations with different intrinsic selectivity, providing a mechanistic basis for allosteric modulation of ligand selectivity.

Anatomic and geographic heterogeneity in genomic profiling of BTC subtypes, genomic co-alterations, and their impact on long-term outcomes are not well defined. Genomic data to characterize alterations among patients with BTCs were derived from the AACR GENIE registry (v15.1) and other genomic data sets. Patterns of mutational co-occurrence, frequency of co-alterations, and their impact on long-term outcomes among BTC patients were examined. Alterations in IDH1 and FGFR2 genes were mostly noted among intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) samples, TP53, ERBB2/HER2, and SMAD4 mutations were more frequent among gallbladder cancer (GBC) samples while extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (eCCA) more commonly harbored KRAS mutations (all Q\u2009<\u20090.001). Alterations in IDH1 and FGFR2 genes were more frequent among iCCA samples from Western vs. Eastern populations, while KRAS, SMAD4, and ERBB2 mutations were more commonly observed among Eastern populations(all Q\u2009<\u20090.05). FGFR2 gene was frequently co-mutated with BAP1 (log2OR: 1.55, Q\u2009<\u20090.001), while IDH1 gene was commonly co-mutated with PBRM1 (log2OR: 1.09, Q\u2009<\u20090.001). Co-alteration rate among patients with IDH1-mutant iCCAs, FGFR2-rearranged iCCAs, KRAS-mutant eCCA, and HER2-mutant GBCs were 80.8%, 85.2%, 76.7%, and 100%, respectively. Among patients with iCCA and FGFR2 fusions/rearrangements, harboring co-alterations in the TP53 pathway or PI3K pathway correlated with worse overall survival (OS), while patients with IDH1-mutant iCCA had worse OS when harboring co-alterations in the cell cycle pathway. Marked genomic heterogeneity exists among patients with BTCs based on anatomic and geographic location. The overwhelming majority of BTC patients with clinically significant mutations had concurrent genomic co-alterations. The current study highlights the molecular complexity of BTCs with multiple alterations that commonly co-exist and could potentially be targeted to treat BTCs.",

          "abstract": "Metastases are the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and their origin is not fully elucidated. Recently, studies have shown that extracellular vesicles (EVs), particularly small extracellular vesicles (sEV), can disrupt the homeostasis of organs, promoting the development of a secondary tumor. However, the role of sEV in brain endothelium and their association with metastasis related to breast cancer is unknown. Thus, this study aimed to investigate sEV-triggered changes in the phosphorylation state of proteins on the surface of brain endothelial cells, as they form the first barrier in contact with circulating tumor cells and EVs, and once identified, to modulate its interactors and effects from this through different functional assays. We used the most aggressive breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, and its brain-seeking variant, MDA-MB-231-br. From these cells, small and large extracellular vesicles were harvested to treat hCMEC/D3 cells, an immortalized cell line from the human brain microvasculature. Higher levels of phosphorylation of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 were found in hCMEC/D3 cells treated with MDA-MB-231-br sEV. By computational analysis, the Valosin-Containing Protein (VCP) was predicted to be an important sEV cargo affecting the VEGFR2 intracellular trafficking, validated by western blotting analysis. Then, VCP was modulated by cell transfection or chemical inhibition in hCMEC/D3 cells and assessed in different functional in vitro assays evidencing a significant effect on the functionality of these cells. Thus, this study demonstrates that the VCP-containing sEVs induce modifications at different phosphor sites of VEGFR2 and effectively modulate the state of brain microvascular endothelial cells.",

          "abstract": "The study aims to investigate the clinicopathological significance of MRPL24 in human cancers, with a particular focus on breast cancer (BC). Comprehensive bioinformatics analyses were conducted using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and various advanced database, including cBioPortal, UALCAN, TIMER, Prognoscan, TISIDB, KM Plotter, and The Human Protein Atlas, to provide a detailed evaluation of MRPL55's role in cancer. The findings were further validated through experimental studies. Pan-cancer analysis of TCGA/ICGC data revealed significant amplification of MRPL24 across multiple cancer types, with the highest amplification rate of 60% observed in metastatic breast cancer. MRPL24 was found to be overexpressed in primary breast tumors, metastatic, and various molecular subtypes of breast cancer. High MRPL24 expression was associated with poor prognosis and lower survival rates in breast cancer patients. RT-PCR and western blot confirmed MRPL24 depletion in breast cancer cells. Knockdown of MRPL24 was shown to suppress proliferation, and clonogenic potential in breast cancer cells and inhibit cell migration. Additionally, MRPL24 depletion sensitized breast cancer cells to PD0325901 and 5-FU treatment. Mechanistic studies revealed that MRPL24 knock-down downregulates mRNA levels of oncogenic genes, including c-MYC, BRD4, WNT3, and STAT3. Positive correlations were observed between MRPL24 and key genes involved in ferroptosis regulation, such as ERBB2, ERBB3, GRB2, PIK3CA, AKT1, MAPK3, and MAPK1. Finally, through virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations, we have identified three FDA-approved drugs with strong binding affinities and interactions with MRPL24. These findings underscore MRPL24's oncogenic role in breast cancer and suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting this protein.

Although multiple therapeutic agents have been proven effective in KIRC, their clinical application has been hindered by a lack of reliable biomarkers. This study focused on the prognostic value and function of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion- (ADME-) related genes (ARGs) in KIRC to enhance personalized therapy. The critical role of ARGs in KIRC microenvironment was confirmed by single cell RNA-seq analysis and spatial transcriptome sequencing analysis for the first time. Then, an ADME-related prognostic signature (ARPS) was developed by the bulk RNA-seq analysis. The ARPS, created through Cox regression, LASSO, and stepAIC analyses, identified eight ARGs that stratified patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. High-risk patients had significantly poorer overall survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent predictive ability of ARPS, and an ARPS-based nomogram was constructed for clinical application. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analyses revealed immune-related functions and pathways enriched in these groups, with low-risk patients showing better responses to immunotherapy. Finally, the expression of ARGs was validated by qRT-PCR and Western blotting experiments. These findings underscore the prognostic significance of ARPS in KIRC and its potential application in guiding personalized treatment strategies.",

Capturing this process as it occurs in vivo, however, remains elusive. Here we employ spatiotemporally controlled oncogene activation and tumor suppressor inhibition together with multiomics to unveil the processes underlying oral epithelial progenitor cell reprogramming into tumor initiating cells at single cell resolution. Tumor initiating cells displayed a distinct stem-like state, defined by aberrant proliferative, hypoxic, squamous differentiation, and partial epithelial to mesenchymal invasive gene programs. YAP-mediated tumor initiating cell programs included activation of oncogenic transcriptional networks and mTOR signaling, and recruitment of myeloid cells to the invasive front contributing to tumor infiltration. Tumor initiating cell transcriptional programs are conserved in human head and neck cancer and associated with poor patient survival. These findings illuminate processes underlying cancer initiation at single cell resolution, and identify candidate targets for early cancer detection and prevention.",

          "abstract": "DEHP is a plasticizer that is widely found in our water environment and poses a significant risk to the environment and human health. Long-term exposure to DEHP can cause endocrine disruption and interfere with the organism's normal functioning. In order to explore the potential effects of DEHP on the development of biological brain tissues, this study used bioinformatics analysis to confirm the diagnostic and prognostic value of PER3 in gliomas and further validated the neurotoxicity of DEHP using methods such as behavioral experiments and molecular biology in zebrafish. The experimental findings revealed that the expression level of PER3 in diseased tissues was significantly lower than that in the control group. In addition, the expression level of PER3 was significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint genes, and oncogenes. Moreover, the ROC curve analysis showed that PER3 could accurately differentiate between GBM tissues and adjacent normal tissues. To further validate the neurotoxicity of DEHP, we analyzed the effects of DEHP exposure on zebrafish development and PER3 expression by behavioral experiments and molecular biology. The results showed that exposure to DEHP substantially altered both the behavioral responses and the gene expression profiles within the brain tissues of zebrafish. PCR results indicate that the expression of circadian rhythm factor PER3 was significantly reduced in the brains of zebrafish in the exposed group, and circadian dysregulation had a certain promoting effect on the development of glioma. The aim of this work was to investigate the potential effects of DEHP contamination in a water environment on organism brain development. It was demonstrated that PER3 is an effective early diagnostic marker, which is of great significance in the diagnosis and clinical prognosis of glioma, and that DEHP exposure can lead to a significant reduction in PER3 expression in zebrafish brain tissue. This study further proved that DEHP has a potential carcinogenic effect, which adds scientific evidence to the carcinogenicity study of DEHP.",

However, essential molecular drivers of invasive BC have now been discovered using innovative genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic methodologies. Nevertheless, few evaluations of the prognostic factors of BC in Saudi Arabia have been performed. Evaluating the biomarkers associated with the development of early-stage BC could help determine the risk of metastasis and guide treatment decisions. In a previous study, using large BC cohorts and artificial neural network techniques, DNA replication and sister chromatid cohesion 1 (<i>DSCC1</i>) was found to be one of the principal genes in invasive BC samples. To date, no studies have addressed the prognostic significance of <i>DSCC1</i> in invasive BC and its association with aggressive tumor behavior. This research aimed to address this gap. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: The association of clinicopathological features and patient outcomes with <i>DSCC1</i> expression at the mRNA level was assessed using the Molecular Taxonomy Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC; <i>n</i> = 1980) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; <i>n</i> = 854) cohorts. <i>DSCC1</i> was also evaluated at the protein level using immunohistochemistry on samples from invasive BC patients (<i>n</i> = 100) presenting to King Abdul Aziz Specialist Hospital in Saudi Arabia. The association of clinicopathological parameters (including patient age, tumor grade, tumor size, and patient outcome) with protein level was also evaluated. <i>Results</i>: In both METABRIC and TCGA cohorts, high expression of <i>DSCC1</i> was significantly associated with high histological grade, large tumor size, lymphovascular invasion positivity, and hormone receptor negativity (all <i>p</i> < 0.001). A high <i>DSCC1</i> mRNA level was associated with poor outcomes (<i>p</i> < 0.001 for METABRIC, <i>p</i> = 0.23 for TCGA). At the protein level, high DSCC1 expression was associated with high histological grade (<i>p</i> = 0.001), lymph node presence (<i>p</i> = 0.008), hormone receptor negativity (<i>p</i> = 0.005), high Ki67 expression (<i>p</i> = 0.036), and shorter survival (<i>p</i> = 0.008). <i>Conclusions</i>: This study confirmed the prognostic significance of DSCC1 in invasive BC patients.

A better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and discovery of biomarkers for targeted therapies are paramount for therapeutic progress.

A significant difference in <i>HTGPCR</i> expression was found between normal tissues and tumors. <i>HTR1D/2C</i> expressed higher levels in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), colon adenocarcinoma, and liver hepatocellular carcinoma. <i>HTGPCR</i> gene expression was correlated with prognosis in many cancers. <i>HTR1D/2C</i> were associated with poorer overall survival for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, <i>HTGPCR</i> expression correlated significantly with the stemness scores of RNA and DNA, TMB, and MSI, as well as stromal and immune scores of pan-cancer patients. Additionally, the expression of <i>HTR2A/2B/7</i> was correlated significantly with immune cells and immune checkpoint genes in a variety of cancers, such as BRCA, brain lower-grade glioma, and lung adenocarcinoma. Immune regulation and TME were both regulated by <i>HTGPCRs</i>. Using single-cell analysis, we found that the gene set of <i>HTGPCRs</i> correlated with many cancer-related functional states in retinoblastoma.

Squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) accounts for the overwhelming majority of vulvar carcinomas and is the focus of this review. As with many cancers, the increased understanding of molecular events during tumorigenesis has led to the emergence of the molecular subclassification of VSCC, which is subclassified into tumors that arise secondary to high-risk human papillomavirus infection (HPV-associated, or HPVa) and those that arise independently of HPV (HPVi), most commonly in the setting of a chronic inflammatory condition of the vulvar skin. This latter group of HPVi VSCC arises in most cases secondary to mutations in <i>TP53</i>, but recently, attention has focused on the uncommon <i>TP53</i> wild-type HPVi VSCC. These three molecular subtypes of VSCC (HPVa, HPVi p53 abnormal, and HPVi p53 wild type), as well as their precursor lesions, cannot be diagnosed based on a routine histopathological examination or immunostaining for p53 and p16 as surrogate markers for <i>TP53</i> mutation and high-risk HPV infection, respectively, are required. The molecular subtyping of VSCC shows high reproducibility and provides important prognostic information. HPVa VSCC has the most favorable prognosis, while HPVi VSCC with <i>TP53</i> mutations (p53abn) has the worst prognosis, and HPVi VSCC with wild-type <i>TP53</i> (p53wt) has an intermediate prognosis. In this review, we discuss the evidence supporting this molecular subclassification and its implications for the diagnosis and treatment of VSCC and its precursors.",

Although ICIs are effective in tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H) solid tumors, the impact on MSS-TMB-H mCRC, a rare subset within MSS mCRC, remains unclear. We conducted a retrospective analysis using clinical and genomic data from the Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics (C-CAT) repository in Japan. Patients with MSS-TMB-H mCRC who underwent tissue-based comprehensive genomic profiling and were treated with pembrolizumab or other later-line therapies were included. Pembrolizumab's efficacy was compared with that of trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI) and regorafenib. Genomic profiles of MSS-TMB-H, MSI-H-TMB-H, and MSS-TMB-low (TMB-L) CRCs were analyzed across 71 cancer-related genes. Among 127 TMB-H mCRC cases treated with pembrolizumab in the C-CAT repository, 77 were MSS and 50 were MSI-H. Pembrolizumab showed significantly shorter time to treatment failure (TTF) and overall survival (OS) in patients with MSS-TMB-H mCRC compared with those with MSI-H-TMB-H mCRC [median TTF 2.0 versus 10.6 months; hazard ratio (HR) 4.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.65-8.64, median OS 4.5 versus 33.6 months; HR 9.86, 95% CI 3.93-24.77, both P < 0.0001]. Among MSS-TMB-H mCRC patients, 19 received pembrolizumab, 73 received FTD/TPI (\u00b1bevacizumab), and 18 received regorafenib as their first later-line therapy.

Pembrolizumab may be less effective than FTD/TPI in later-line treatment of MSS-TMB-H mCRC, potentially due to genomic similarities between MSS-TMB-H and MSS-TMB-L CRC, suggesting the need for alternative therapeutic strategies in this subgroup.",

A deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in melanoma pathogenesis is crucial for improving diagnosis and therapy. Non-coding RNAs, with their extensive regulatory roles, show promise as diagnostic biomarkers. This study focuses on evaluating the <i>FER1L4</i> pseudogene and its potential role in melanoma. <i>FER1L4</i> expression was analyzed in normal melanocytes and melanoma cell lines using qRT-PCR. Additionally, TCGA data and online prediction tools were employed to correlate expression levels with clinicopathological features. The relationship between <i>FER1L4</i>, patient phenotypes, and immune responses was further explored using REACTOME, GSEA, and immune deconvolution analyses. <i>In vitro</i> analysis revealed significant upregulation of <i>FER1L4</i> in melanoma cells. Its expression levels were influenced by <i>BRAF</i> mutations and were markedly higher in metastatic compared to primary melanomas. Higher <i>FER1L4</i> expression was associated with improved patient survival. Furthermore, <i>miR-514a-5p</i>, <i>miR-330-5p</i>, and <i>miR-128-3p</i> were identified as interacting with <i>FER1L4</i>. Dysregulated genes involved in immune signaling pathways were also identified as potential miRNA targets. This is the first study to demonstrate the association of <i>FER1L4</i> with melanoma. Patients with elevated <i>FER1L4</i> levels exhibited distinct phenotypes, altered immunological profiles, and improved survival rates. These findings suggest that <i>FER1L4</i> could serve as a potential biomarker for melanoma.",

The protein methyltransferase SET and MYND domain-containing 3 (SMYD3), which trimethylates H3K4, activates gene transcription and enhances several oncogenic pathways, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell cycle related pathways, in various cancer types. It was also recently shown that SMYD3 is overexpressed in HPV-negative HNSCC, and represses the expression of type I IFN response genes, contributing to resistance to anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade in this disease. In this study, we show that SMYD3 depletion using siRNA interference or CRISPR decreases cellular proliferation and clonal capacity, induces cell cycle arrest and decreases the invasive potential of HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines. Accordingly, xenografts of SMYD3 knockout tumors derived from a human HPV-negative HNSCC cell line grew significantly slower compared to control tumors in mice. Genome-wide mapping for SMYD3 and H3K4me3 in HPV-negative HNSCC cells using cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) assays identified direct downstream gene targets regulated by SMYD3, including cell cycle- and EMT-promoting genes. This study provides insights into the epigenetic role of SMYD3 as an oncogene in HPV-negative HNSCC and supports SMYD3 as a rational therapeutic target in HPV-negative HNSCC.",

ATAC-, ChIP-, and RNA-seq analyses reveal that JUNB/AP1- and HDAC-mediated epigenetic programs repress pro-inflammatory signatures in tumor cells, antagonizing cJUN/AP1 signaling, favoring a therapy-responsive classical neoplastic state. This dichotomous regulation is amplified via regional TNF-\u03b1<sup>+</sup> macrophages, which associates with a reactive phenotype and reduced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration in patients. Consequently, combined preclinical anti-TNF-\u03b1 immunotherapy and chemotherapy reduces macrophages and promotes CD3<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration in basal-like PDAC, improving survival.

Growing evidence indicates that glucose metabolism reprogramming is the most representative metabolic signature of tumor cells and exploring its modulatory function in EC development will promote identifying potential EC therapeutic targets. IGFBP2 is an insulin-like growth factor binding protein which is closely associated with a variety of metabolic diseases. However, its biological role in EC and its effects on glucose metabolism remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that IGFBP2 was highly expressed in EC tissues and correlated with poor prognosis. Overexpression of IGFBP2 promoted proliferation and glycolysis in EC cells, whereas IGFBP2 knockdown had the opposite effect. Mechanistically, IGFBP2 directly interacted with PKM2, inducing weakened PKM2 protein degradation, and knockdown IGFBP2 expression prevented the translocation of PKM2 to the nucleus. Additionally, IGFBP2 expression was upregulated under the condition of hypoxia which directly regulated by transcriptional activation of HIF-1\u03b1. Finally, the role of the IGFBP2/PKM2/HIF-1\u03b1 axis in EC tumor growth was confirmed in\u00a0vivo using mouse xenograft models. Taken together, the current study identifies IGFBP2 as an upstream activator of PKM2-driven proliferation and glycolysis in EC cells, providing a promising therapeutic target for EC.",

We aimed to elucidate the role of these poorly understood genetic changes by using CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screening in mouse livers to identify which genes within these amplified loci are cancer driver genes. We used data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify that frequently copy number-amplified and up-regulated genes all reside on human chromosomes 1q and 8q. We generated CRISPRa screening transposons that contain oncogenic Myc to drive tumor formation. We conducted CRISPRa screens in\u00a0vivo in the liver to identify tumor driver genes. We extensively validated the findings in separate mice and performed RNA sequencing analysis to explore mechanisms driving tumorigenesis. We targeted genes that frequently undergo amplification in human HCC using an in\u00a0vivo CRISPRa screening system in mice, which induced extensive liver tumorigenesis. Human chromosome 1q genes Zbtb7b, Vps72, Gba1, and Mrpl9 emerged as drivers of liver tumorigenesis. In human HCC there is a trend in correlation between levels of MRPL9, VPS72, or GBA1 and poor survival. In validation assays, activation of Vps72, Gba1, or Mrpl9 resulted in extensive liver tumorigenesis and decreased survival in mice. RNA sequencing revealed different mechanisms driving HCC, with Mrpl9 activation altering genes functionally related to mitochondrial function, Vps72 levels altering phospholipid metabolism, and Gba1 activation enhancing endosomal-lysosomal activity, all leading to promotion of cellular proliferation. Analysis of human tumor tissues with high levels of MRPL9, VPS72, or GBA1 revealed congruent results, indicating conserved mechanisms driving HCC. This study reveals chromosome 1q genes Vps72, Gba1, and Mrpl9 as drivers of HCC. Future efforts to prevent or treat HCC can focus on these new driver genes.",

Here, plasma SRRM1, SNRNP200, and SRSF3 levels, previously identified to play a pathophysiological role in PCa, were determined in control individuals (<i>n</i>\u00a0= 40) and PCa patients (<i>n</i>\u00a0= 166). We found that plasma SRRM1 and SNRNP200 levels were elevated in PCa patients and discriminated between control individuals and PCa patients.

Prognosis, tumor microenvironment (TME) elements, and treatment responses varied across subtypes. Using LASSO, Cox regression, and differential expression analysis, we developed a stemness-risk model. BRCA patients were divided into two groups (Cluster A and Cluster B). Cluster B exhibited an improved prognosis, higher PIK3CA mutation frequency, and increased levels of CD8 T cells and regulatory Tregs. A 5-gene stemness model was constructed, showing that higher stemness scores correlated with poorer prognosis. The model was validated using the METABRIC cohort data from cBioPortal.

TCGA RNA-Seq data within the cBioportal platform comparing HNSCC samples (n = 515 patients with RNA-Seq data) to normal tissue (n = 82 patients) was interrogated for significant differences in nuclear receptor expression. Affymetrix microarray analysis of HNSCC tumors relative to normal oral mucosa (41 tumor, 13 normal) was analyzed. Of the 48 NR genes and 19 NR cofactors examined, 99 % of tumor samples in the TCGA had some form of NR gene 'alteration' compared to normal tissue. These alterations predominantly encompass expression changes. NR genes (PPARG) and (RORC), and the NR cofactor, (NCOA1), were differentially expressed and downregulated in tumors compared to normal tissue. We have discovered significant decreases in PPARG expression with co-occurring changes in genes involved with lipid metabolism and cell cycle progression in HNSCC. We are targeting PPAR\u03b3 with thiazolidinediones in a series of clinical trials to restore normal signaling via differentiation to hopefully reverse carcinogenesis. We also observed several receptors with differential expression associated with clinical factors that may become the focus of interest in future targeting efforts.

Nevertheless, an extensive examination of the comprehensive pan-cancer impact on SMAD3's diagnostic, prognostic, and immunological predictive utility has yet to be undertaken. Bioinformatics methods were employed to systematically investigate the potential carcinogenic impact of SMAD3. We extensively harnessed data from authoritative sources, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), cBioPortal, Human Protein Atlas (HPA), UALCAN, and various other databases. Our study encompassed a comprehensive analysis of the following aspects: differential SMAD3 expression and its association with prognosis across diverse cancer types, gene mutations, immune cell infiltration, single-cell sequencing analysis, DNA methylation patterns, and drug sensitivity profiles. In vitro experiments were conducted with the primary objective of appraising both the expression profile and the precise functional attributes of SMAD3 within the milieu of Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC). Our findings revealed significant variations in SMAD3 expression between cancerous and adjacent normal tissues. High levels of SMAD3 expression were consistently associated with unfavorable prognoses across multiple cancer types,. Additionally, our analysis of SMAD3 methylation patterns in human cancers unveiled a favorable prognosis linked to elevated DNA methylation levels in pan-cancer. Furthermore, we identified positive associations between SMAD3 expression and RNAm6A methylation-related genes in the majority of cancers. Moreover, SMAD3 expression displayed substantial correlations with immune cell infiltration. Notably, immune checkpoint genes exhibited significant associations with SMAD3 expression across diverse cancers. Single-cell sequencing results elucidated the pan-cancer single-cell expression landscape of SMAD3. Within specific cancer subtypes, SMAD3 expression exhibited a noteworthy positive association with distinctive facets of malignancy. Finally, in our comprehensive analysis of drug sensitivity, we discerned a catalog of prospective therapeutic agents. In our comprehensive analysis across multiple cancer types, we observed a significant disparity in SMAD3 expression compared to normal tissues, and this findings suggest that SMAD3 holds promise as both a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target against various cancers.

          "abstract": "Endometrial cancer, a common gynecological malignancy, poses significant clinical challenges, particularly in advanced or recurrent cases. TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a serine/threonine kinase, plays crucial roles in inflammation and immunity by activating nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB and interferon regulatory factor 3. However, its specific roles in endometrial cancer remain unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-cancer effects and underlying mechanisms of amlexanox, a TBK1 inhibitor, against endometrial cancer. The main genetic mutations in TBK1 were found to be mRNA downregulation and missense mutations. Kaplan-Meier plotter analysis revealed that low TBK1 expression was associated with a good prognosis in patients with uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). <i>In vitro</i> experiments demonstrated that <i>TBK1</i> knockdown or amlexanox significantly inhibited the proliferation, cell cycle progression, and migration of endometrial cancer cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of targeting TBK1 on cancer cell proliferation and migration were mediated by the protein kinase B (AKT)/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Xenograft experiments revealed that both amlexanox treatment and <i>TBK1</i> knockdown effectively suppressed the tumor growth. Overall, this study highlights the potent anti-cancer effects of amlexanox against endometrial cancer by modulating AKT/NF-\u03baB signaling, thus providing a new avenue for the development of novel TBK1-targeting therapeutic strategies for UCEC.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Exploring new prognostic and therapeutic targets in patients with breast cancer is essential. This study investigated the expression of MET, ESR1, and ESR2 genes and their association with clinicopathologic characteristics and clinical outcomes in patients with breast cancer. The METABRIC dataset for breast cancer was obtained from the cBioPortal public domain. Gene expression data for <i>MET</i>, <i>ESR1</i>, and <i>ESR2</i>, as well as the putative copy number alterations (CNAs) for <i>MET</i> were retrieved. The <i>MET</i> mRNA expression levels correlated inversely with the expression levels of <i>ESR1</i> and positively with the expression levels of <i>ESR2</i> (<i>r</i>\u2009=\u2009-0.379, <i>p</i> < 0.001 and <i>r</i>\u2009=\u20090.066, and <i>p</i>=0.004, respectively). The <i>ESR1</i> mRNA expression was significantly different among <i>MET</i> CNAs groups (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Patients with high <i>MET</i>/<i>ESR1</i> coexpression had favorable clinicopathologic tumor characteristics and prognosticators compared to low <i>MET/ESR1</i> coexpression in terms of greater age at diagnosis, reduced Nottingham Prognostic Index, lower tumor grade, hormone receptor positivity, HER2-negative status, and luminal subtype (<i>p</i> < 0.001). In contrast, patients with high <i>MET</i>/<i>ESR2</i> coexpression had unfavorable tumor features and advanced prognosticators compared to patients with low <i>MET</i>/<i>ESR2</i> coexpression (<i>p</i> < 0.001). No significant difference in overall survival was observed based on the <i>MET/ESR</i> coexpression status. However, when data were stratified based on the treatment type (chemotherapy and hormonal therapy), survival was significantly different based on the coexpression status of <i>MET/ESR</i>. Findings from our study add to the growing evidence on the potential crosstalk between MET and estrogen receptors in breast cancer. The expression of the MET/ESR genes could be a novel prognosticator and calls for future studies to evaluate the impact of combinational treatment approaches with MET inhibitors and endocrine drugs in breast cancer.",

However, the prognostic potential of CYFIP2 in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. In this work, we first explain the great potential of CYFIP2 malignant progression from a broader perspective (pan-cancer) and confirm its oncogenic value in pancreatic cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database, CELL and GEO databases were utilized to explore the distribution of the CYFIP2 gene in human cancers. Data were analyzed using a variety of web-based platforms and software such as R (4.3.2), UCSC, MethSurv, Cytoscape (v3.10.2), UALAND, STRING, TISIDB, Harmonizome 3.0, TIMER 2.0, TCIA and TIDE. The R packages R packages ?limma? and ?ggplot2? were used to compare and visualize CYFIP2 mRNA expression. The R packages ?survminer? and ?survival? were used to statistically analyze the relationship between CYFIP2 expression and the survival and prognosis of tumor patients. the R package ?ss GSEA? was used to assess the correlation between CYFIP2 expression and immune infiltration. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) were used to explore the multiple biological functions and regulatory pathways in which CYFIP2 co-expressed genes co-engage in pancreatic cancer. The R package ?maftool? was used to explore somatic mutation information in pancreatic cancer, and the TIDE database and the R package ?oncoPredic? were used to explore immunotherapeutic responses and sensitive drugs. Pancreatic cancer cell lines were constructed with the specific expression of CYFIP2 mRNA, and their invasive and metastatic abilities were analysed using scratch and transwell assays. Bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments confirmed that CYFIP2 was differentially expressed in a variety of tumors and correlated with clinical stage, and could be used as a potential marker for evaluating the prognosis and immunotherapy of a variety of tumors, including KIRC (Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma), PAAD (Pancreatic adenocarcinoma), PAAD (Pancreatic adenocarcinoma), SKCM (Skin Cutaneous Melanoma), and UCEC (Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma).Mutations in the CYFIP2 gene and methylation indices can affect the prognosis of tumor patients. In addition, we found that CYFIP2 expression values in pancreatic cancer were positively correlated with the expression of most immune cells, especially CD8?+?T Cells, and significantly negatively correlated with macrophages M0, and negatively correlated with the metastatic and invasive ability of pancreatic cancer cells, which may provide new strategies and ideas for pancreatic cancer immunotherapy.",

However, its role in tumours is not well understood. DCLRE1B expression profiles were examined in tumour tissues and normal tissues using TCGA, GTEx, and TARGET datasets. Additionally, we performed experiments with clinical melanoma samples to verify DCLRE1B expression patterns. We also performed pancancer analyses to investigate the diverse roles of DCLRE1B in the biological functions of various cancers. DCLRE1B exhibited distinct expression patterns and played crucial prognostic roles in most tumours. In particular, high expression of DCLRE1B in melanoma was significantly correlated with a poor prognosis and increased malignancy. DCLRE1B was also found to be associated with the immune landscape and various immune biomarkers and regulators. Furthermore, our analysis identified potential small molecules that could target DCLRE1B in different cancer types. The DCLRE1B gene may be involved in the development and occurrence of a variety of cancers. Additionally, DCLRE1B affects various tumour types not only by mediating DNA repair but also by shaping the differential immune microenvironment.

A clinical study in anthracycline-refractory MpBC patients suggested that nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (L-NMMA) may augment anti-tumor efficacy of taxane. We report that NOS blockade potentiated response of human MpBC cell lines and tumors to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor alpelisib and taxane. Mechanistically, NOS blockade leads to a decrease in the S-nitrosylation of c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun complex to repress its transcriptional output, leading to enhanced tumor differentiation and associated chemosensitivity. As a result, combined NOS and PI3K inhibition with taxane targets MpBC stem cells and improves survival in patient-derived xenograft models relative to single-/dual-agent therapy. Similarly, biopsies from MpBC tumors that responded to L-NMMA+taxane therapy showed a post-treatment reversal of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and decreased stemness. Our findings suggest that combined inhibition of iNOS and PI3K is a unique strategy to decrease chemoresistance and improve clinical outcomes in MpBC.",

Enhancing immunotherapy outcomes through personalized treatment strategies, particularly by identifying immune-related biomarkers, is critical. The ASXL family are associated with malignancies, but their relationship with HNSCC has not been elucidated. In this study, we found that high expression of ASXL2 is associated with better prognosis in HNSCC patients. Analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between ASXL2 and immune infiltration. Functional analysis suggests that ASXL2 co-expressed genes in HNSCC patients are enriched in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and patients with high expression show an even greater enrichment in T cell and B cell receptor signaling pathways. Utilizing the NPC single-cell dataset, ASXL2's widespread expression in the tumor microenvironment was confirmed, and its co-expressed genes were found to be highly associated with immune cell function. Experimental validation showed a correlation between ASXL2 expression and T cell secretion of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3), confirming that high ASXL2 expression facilitates T cell activation. Overall, our findings underscore the important role of ASXL2 in immune activation, suggesting its potential as a promising biomarker for tailoring immunotherapy strategies in HNSCC patients.",

A retrospective analysis of 937 CCA patients was performed using data from cBioPortal to examine KRAS mutation profiles and their association with survival. Plasma from 101 CCA patients was analyzed for KRAS G12/G13 mutations in the cfDNA using droplet digital PCR, and the results were compared with tissue-based sequencing from 78 matched samples. KRAS driver mutations were found in 15.6% of patients, with common variants being G12D (37.0%), G12V (24.0%) and Q61H (8.2%). Patients harboring KRAS mutations exhibited decreased overall and recurrence-free survival. KRAS G12/G13 mutations were detected in 14.9% of cfDNA samples, showing moderate concordance with tissue sequencing, and achieving 80% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Elevated KRAS G12/G13 MAF in cfDNA, combined with high CA19-9 levels, correlated with poorer survival outcomes. The presence of KRAS mutations was associated with poor survival in CCA, underscoring the importance of KRAS mutations as prognostic markers. The detection of KRAS mutations in cfDNA demonstrated potential as a promising non-invasive alternative for mutation detection and, when combined with CA19-9 levels, may improve prognostic efficacy in CCA.",

          "abstract": "Multi-omics data integration has become increasingly crucial for a deeper understanding of the complexity of biological systems. However, effectively integrating and analyzing multi-omics data remains challenging due to their heterogeneity and high dimensionality. Existing methods often struggle with noise, redundant features, and the complex interactions between different omics layers, leading to suboptimal performance. Additionally, they face difficulties in adequately capturing intra-omics interactions due to simplistic concatenation techiniques, and they risk losing critical inter-omics interaction information when using hierarchical attention layers. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Denoised Multi-Omics Integration approach that leverages the Transformer multi-head self-attention mechanism (DMOIT). DMOIT consists of three key modules: a generative adversarial imputation network for handling missing values, a sampling-based robust feature selection module to reduce noise and redundant features, and a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) based feature extractor with a noval architecture that enchance the intra-omics interaction capture. We validated model porformance using cancer datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), conducting two tasks: survival time classification across different cancer types and estrogen receptor status classification for breast cancer. Our results show that DMOIT outperforms traditional machine learning methods and the state-of-the-art integration method MoGCN in terms of accuracy and weighted F1 score. Furthermore, we compared DMOIT with various alternative MHSA-based architectures to further validate our approach. Our results show that DMOIT consistently outperforms these models across various cancer types and different omics combinations. The strong performance and robustness of DMOIT demonstrate its potential as a valuable tool for integrating multi-omics data across various applications.",

Chronic exposure to bacterial components induces changes in the nearby cells.

The study followed a computational design. Multiple tools and databases, such as GEOmnibus, STRING, Metascape, PANTHER, and UALCAN, cBioportal, were used to derive an association between gene expression during infection with <i>P. gingivalis,</i> and the resulting gene expression profiles were analyzed in the HNSCC dataset.

In this work, we developed a multi-modal ensemble model (MMEM) which integrates pretreatment clinical information, multi-omics data, and histopathology whole slide image (WSI) data to learn complementary information to predict overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for patients with ccRCC. We collected 226 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma dataset (TCGA-KIRC). These patients have OS and DFS follow up data available and five different data modalities provided, including clinical information, pathology data in the form of WSI, and three multi-omics data, which comprise mRNA expression, miRNA expression (miRSeq), and DNA methylation data. Five sets of separate survival prediction models were constructed separately for OS and DFS. We used a traditional Cox-proportional hazards (CPH) model with iterative forward feature selection for clinical and multi-omics data. Four different types of pre-trained encoder models, comprising ResNet and three recently developed general purpose foundation models for computational pathology, were utilized to extract features from processed WSI patches. A deep learning-based CPH model was constructed to predict survival outcomes using these encoded WSI features. For each of the survival outcomes of interest, we weigh and combine the predicted risk scores from all the five models to generate the final prediction. Model weighting was based on the training performance. Five-fold cross validation was performed to train and test the proposed workflow. We employed the concordance index (C-index) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) metrics to assess the performance of our models for time-to-event prediction and time-specific binary prediction, respectively. Among the sub-models, the clinical feature based CPH model has the highest weight for both prediction tasks. For WSI-based prediction, the encoded feature using an image-based general purpose foundation model (UNI) showed the best prediction performance over other pretrained feature encoders. Our final model outperformed corresponding single-modality models on all prediction labels, achieving C-indices of 0.820 and 0.833 for OS and DFS, respectively. The AUROC values for binary prediction at follow-up of 3 year were 0.831 and 0.862 for patient death and cancer recurrence, respectively. Using the medians of predicted risks as thresholds to identify high-risk and low-risk patient groups, we performed log-rank tests, which revealed improved performance in both OS and DFS compared to single-modality models. We developed the first multi-modal prediction model MMEM for ccRCC patients that integrates features across five different data modalities. Our model demonstrated better prognostic ability compared with corresponding single-modality models for both prediction targets. If findings are independently reproduced, it has the potential to assist in management of ccRCC patients.",

We report that KRAS wild-type (WT)-amplified tumor models are sensitive to treatment with the small-molecule KRAS inhibitors BI-2493 and BI-2865. These pan-KRAS inhibitors directly target the \"OFF\" state of KRAS and result in potent antitumor activity in preclinical models of cancers driven by KRAS-mutant proteins. In this study, we used the high-throughput cellular viability Profiling Relative Inhibition Simultaneously in Mixtures assay to assess the antiproliferative activity of BI-2493 in a 900+ cancer cell line panel, expanding on our previous work. KRAS WT-amplified cancer cell lines, with a copy number >7, were identified as the most sensitive, across cell lines with any KRAS alterations, to our pan-KRAS inhibitors. Importantly, our data suggest that a KRAS \"OFF\" inhibitor is better suited to treat KRAS WT-amplified tumors than a KRAS \"ON\" inhibitor. KRAS WT amplification is common in patients with gastroesophageal cancers in which it has been shown to act as a unique cancer driver with little overlap to other actionable mutations. The pan-KRAS inhibitors BI-2493 and BI-2865 show potent antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo in KRAS WT-amplified cell lines from this and other tumor types. In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate that direct pharmacologic inhibition of KRAS shows antitumor activity in preclinical models of cancer with KRAS WT amplification, suggesting a novel therapeutic concept for patients with cancers bearing this KRAS alteration.",

          "abstract": "Angiosarcomas are a group of vascular cancers that form malignant blood vessels. These malignancies are seemingly inflamed primarily due to their pathognomonic nature, which consists of irregular endothelium and tortuous blood channels. PIK3CA mutations are oncogenic and disrupt the PI3K pathway. In this study, we aimed to define the molecular and functional consequences of oncogenic PIK3CA mutations in angiosarcoma. We first generated two isogenic hemangiosarcoma cell lines harboring the H1047R hotspot mutations in PIK3CA gene using CRISPR/Cas9. We found PIK3CA-mutant cells established distinct molecular signatures in global gene expression and chromatin accessibility, which were associated with enrichment of immune cytokine signaling, including IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1. These molecular processes were disrupted by the PI3K-\u03b1 specific inhibitor, alpelisib. We also observed that the molecular distinctions in PIK3CA-mutant cells were linked to metabolic reprogramming in glycolytic activity and mitochondrial respiration. Our multi-omics analysis revealed that activating PIK3CA mutations regulate molecular machinery that contributes to phenotypic alterations and resistance to alpelisib. Furthermore, we identified potential therapeutic vulnerabilities of PIK3CA mutations in response to PI3K-\u03b1 inhibition mediated by MAPK signaling. In summary, we demonstrate that PIK3CA mutations perpetuate PI3K activation and reinforce immune enrichment to promote drug resistance in vascular cancers.",

          "abstract": "Treatment options for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are limited and patients face a poor prognosis. Here, we sought to identify drugs that target TNBC vulnerabilities and understand the biology underlying these responses. We analyzed the Broad Institute DepMap to identify recurrent TNBC vulnerabilities and performed a 45-compound screen on vulnerability-related pathways on a set of up to 8 TNBC cell lines. We identified a subset of cell lines with an ITGAV vulnerability and a differential sensitivity to cilengitide, an integrin inhibitor targeting ITGAV:ITGB3 and ITGAV:ITGB5. Next, we sought to understand cilengitide resistance and response biomarkers. Clinical trials targeting integrins continue enrolling patients, necessitating an understanding of how these drugs affect tumors. We combined in vitro assays with computational approaches to systematically explore the differential sensitivity to cilengitide and resistance mechanisms. We tested an additional pan-ITGAV inhibitor (GLPG0187) to determine how generalizable our findings on cilengitide sensitivity might be to integrin inhibition. ITGB4, ITGA3, and ITGA6 knockdown experiments assessed the importance of integrin monomers in cell attachment during cilengitide treatment. Additionally, we explored the role of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in cilengitide response by performing cell replating experiments and by culturing on collagen, fibronectin, or laminin coated plates. We discovered that cell-derived ECM modulates cilengitide sensitivity and exogenous fibronectin addition conferred resistance to all sensitive TNBC cell lines, though fibronectin expression did not correlate with sensitivity. Instead, elevated overall integrin protein levels, not specific integrins, in TNBC cells positively correlated with resistance. This suggested that high pan-integrin expression promotes cilengitide resistance. Thus, we tested cilengitide in six luminal breast cancer cell lines (which have low integrin levels); all were sensitive. Also, pan-ITGAV inhibitor, GLPG0187, showed the same sensitivity profile across our TNBC cell lines, suggesting our findings apply to other integrin inhibitors. Integrin inhibitors are appealing candidates to pursue as anti-cancer drugs because they are generally well-tolerated, but their efficacy is mixed, possibly due to the absence of predictive markers. Cilengitide induces death in breast cancer cells with low integrin abundance, where complementary ECM promotes survival. Thus, integrin inhibition in breast cancer warrants further study.",

TSGs largely assort into distinct classes associated with either pan-cancer (Class 1) or lineage-specific (Class 2) patterns of selection for biallelic loss, although some TSGs are predominantly monoallelically inactivated (Class 3/4). We demonstrate that selection for biallelic inactivation can be utilized to identify driver genes in non-canonical contexts, including among variants of unknown significance (VUSs) of several TSGs such as KEAP1. Genomic, functional, and clinical data collectively indicate that KEAP1 VUSs phenocopy established KEAP1 oncogenic alleles and that zygosity, rather than variant classification, is predictive of therapeutic response. TSG zygosity is therefore a fundamental determinant of disease etiology and therapeutic sensitivity.",

Formin-like protein 1 (FMNL1) is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells. Given its role in leukemia cell proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion, this study investigates FMNL1 expression in normal hematopoiesis and myeloid neoplasms and explores associations with clinical-laboratory characteristics, mutational status, and survival outcomes in AML. Transcript levels of <i>FMNL1</i> from several blood-forming cell populations and myeloid neoplasms were extracted from publicly available databases. Myeloid neoplasm cell lines were used for gene/protein expression and cell differentiation studies. Functional genomics analysis was performed using RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) AML study, and drug sensitivity predictions were investigated using Beat AML and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) datasets. Statistical analyses assessed the impact of <i>FMNL1</i> expression on clinical outcomes. FMNL1 was highly expressed in metamyelocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes compared to hematopoietic stem cells, and its expression increased with granulocytic differentiation. FMNL1 expression was elevated in AML and CML patients compared to healthy donors. <i>FMNL1</i> expression was not significantly associated with clinical-laboratory characteristics or survival outcomes but showed a higher frequency of WT1 transcription factor (WT1) mutations with low <i>FMNL1</i> expression in AML patients. High FMNL1 expression in AML correlated with immune response and inflammatory activity pathways. <i>FMNL1</i> mRNA levels influenced drug sensitivity in AML models, with correlations observed for specific antineoplastic agents. FMNL1 plays a potential role in granulocyte differentiation and function, and its differential expression is linked to critical signaling pathways in leukemogenesis and inflammation. These findings highlight FMNL1's potential therapeutic implications in myeloid neoplasia, warranting further investigation.",

N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) induced the early commitment of the differentiation of granule cell precursors (GCPs) to neurons, especially Purkinje cells, via the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptor \u03b16 subunit (Gabra6) axis; moreover, Jdp2 depletion enhanced this differentiation program of GCPs. The antioxidative effect of NAC was the main driving force of this decision toward the neural differentiation of the GCP population in the presence of Gabra6 in vitro.

The molecular profile of adult PLG has not been well-characterized. We report the clinical, pathological, and molecular findings of six adult PLG patients (five males and one female), median age 58\u2009years. All cases exhibited pathological leptomeningeal enhancement at presentation. Leptomeningeal biopsy was diagnostic in five (of six) cases, revealing infiltration by an astrocytic glioma with mitotic activity, lacking microvascular proliferation or necrosis. One case was diagnosed at autopsy. All tumors were IDH-wildtype, with five harboring TERT promoter mutations. Additional mutations identified were PTEN in one case, TP53 in two cases, and NF1 in two cases. A chromosome profile with +7/-10 was found in four cases, whereas the remaining two showed either chromosome 7 or 7p gain only. Four cases showed chromosome 9p loss with CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion, one case showed hemizygous CDKN2A/B loss, and one case showed intact chromosome 9 and CDK4/GLI1 amplification. DNA methylation profiling was performed in four cases and revealed a match to glioblastoma (GBM) family and mesenchymal typical class with high confidence scores in two cases; the other two cases showed only suggestive combined scores for GBM family and mesenchymal atypical class. The molecular profile of all cases closely aligned with that of adult-type GBM, IDH-wildtype, CNS WHO grade 4. All patients succumbed to the disease. In five cases with extensive leptomeningeal disease at diagnosis, the course was rapid, with median survival of 24\u2009days following palliative care. Only one case, with relatively localized disease at diagnosis, received chemoradiation therapy and survived 535\u2009days, raising the possibility that early diagnosis and timely treatment could improve outcome.

In the K-cohort, the median age was 66 years, and molecular analyses revealed <i>TERT</i> promoter mutations in 55.9% of cases, with no cases exhibiting <i>H3F3A, HIST1H3B</i>, or <i>BRAF</i> mutations. Sequential radiological imaging from the K-cohort provided unique insights, showing one case originating in the corpus callosum (CC) and 3 cases originating in the cerebral hemisphere before developing into bGB. Multi-regional sampling supported a mutational trajectory from the hemisphere to the CC. These observations indicate the presence of 2 distinct radiological origins for bGB. Consequently, we classified cases into CC-type and Hemispheric-type based on the tumor volume ratio within the CC. This subgrouping was clinically meaningful; the CC-type is an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival, with a hazard ratio of 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1-3.0, <i>P</i>\u2005=\u2005.033), and is molecularly distinct by a higher frequency of methylated <i>MGMT</i>p (<i>P</i>\u2005=\u2005.0039) compared to the Hemispheric-type. Our results highlight that the radiological features of bGB are not homogenous and can indicate 2 potential subtypes based on their origins.

Various algorithms have been developed to predict the impact of missense variants that influence oncogenic drivers. However, computational pipelines that handle biological data must integrate multiple software tools, which can add complexity and hinder non-specialist users from accessing the pipeline. Here, we have developed an online user-friendly web server tool PredictONCO that is fully automated and has a low barrier to access. The tool models the structure of the mutant protein in the first step. Next, it calculates the protein stability change, pocket level information, evolutionary conservation, and changes in ionisation of catalytic amino acid residues, and uses them as the features in the machine-learning predictor. The XGBoost-based predictor was validated on an independent subset of held-out data, demonstrating areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.97 and 0.94, and the average precision from the precision-recall curve of 0.99 and 0.94 for structure-based and sequence-based predictions, respectively. Finally, PredictONCO calculates the docking results of small molecules approved by regulatory authorities. We demonstrate the applicability of the tool by presenting its usage for variants in two cancer-associated proteins, cellular tumour antigen p53 and fibroblast growth factor receptor FGFR1.

However, some patients experience poor outcomes due to the development of resistance to conventional therapies. Genetic alterations, including mutations in BRAF, Met, and p53, play critical roles in thyroid cancer progression, with the BRAF V600E mutation detected in over 60% of cases. This study investigates the tumor-suppressive role of Annexin A7 (ANXA7) in thyroid cancer, focusing on its potential impact on tumor behavior and therapeutic response. Our analysis, which included RNA sequencing and protein profiling, revealed reduced ANXA7 expression in thyroid cancer cells, particularly in those harboring the BRAF V600E mutation. Upon treatment with inhibitors targeting BRAF and MEK, ANXA7 expression increased, leading to reduced phosphorylation of ERK and activation of apoptotic pathways. Additionally, we identified the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 as a key player in modulating resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Combination therapies aimed at concurrently increasing p21 and ANXA7 levels resulted in a marked enhancement of apoptosis. These findings suggest a previously uncharacterized regulatory network involving the ANXA7/p21/BRAF/MAPK/p53 axis, which may contribute to drug resistance in thyroid cancer. This study provides new insights into overcoming resistance to BRAF and MAPK inhibitors, with implications for treating thyroid cancer and potentially other BRAF-mutant tumors. Future efforts will focus on high-throughput screening approaches to explore ANXA7-targeted therapeutic strategies for thyroid cancer.",

Because individual clinical outcomes of DLBCL in response to standard therapy differ widely, new treatment strategies are being investigated to improve therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we identified a novel signature for stratification of DLBCL useful for prognosis prediction and treatment selection. First, 408 prognostic gene sets were selected from approximately 2500 DLBCL samples in public databases, from which four gene-pair signatures consisting of seven prognostic genes were identified by Cox regression analysis. Then, the risk score was calculated based on these gene-pairs and we validated the risk score as a prognostic predictor for DLBCL patient outcomes. This risk score demonstrated independent predictive performance even when combined with other clinical parameters and molecular subtypes. Evaluating external DLBCL cohorts, we demonstrated that the risk-scoring model based the four gene-pair signatures leads to stable predictive performance, compared with nine existing predictive models. Finally, high-risk DLBCL showed high resistance to DNA damage caused by anticancer drugs, suggesting that this characteristic is responsible for the unfavorable prognosis of high-risk DLBCL patients.

          "abstract": "Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a vitamin K-dependent \u03b3-carboxylated protein that was initially identified as a physiological inhibitor of ectopic calcification, primarily affecting cartilage and the vascular system. Mutations in the <i>MGP</i> gene were found to be responsible for the Keutel syndrome, a condition characterized by abnormal calcifications in the cartilage, lungs, brain, and vascular system. <i>MGP</i> has been shown to be dysregulated in several tumors, including cervical, ovarian, urogenital, and breast cancers. Using bioinformatic approaches, transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) containing CpG dinucleotides were identified in the <i>MGP</i> promoter, including those for YY1, GATA1, and C/EBP\u03b1. We carried out functional tests using transient transfections with a luciferase reporter assay, primarily for the transcription factors YY1, GATA1, C/EBP\u03b1, and RUNX2. By co-transfection analysis, we found that YY1, GATA1, and C/EBP\u03b1 repressed the <i>MGP</i> promoter. Furthermore, the co-transfection with RUNX2 activated the <i>MGP</i> promoter. In addition, <i>MGP</i> expression is negatively or positively correlated with the studied TFs' expression levels in several cancer types. This study provides novel insights into <i>MGP</i> regulation by demonstrating that YY1, GATA1, and C/EBP\u03b1 are negative regulators of the <i>MGP</i> promoter, and DNA methylation may influence their activity. The dysregulation of these mechanisms in cancer should be further elucidated.",

          "abstract": "Rat Sarcoma (RAS)-driven cancers have been one of the main foci in the field of cancer science for over four decades. Despite significant improvement in understanding the biology of RAS oncogene, the method to target RAS-mutated cancers is still unclear. In recent years, the role for RAS beyond its hyperproliferation has been extensively documented. In this review, we systematically address and dwell on the details of the mechanisms of RAS oncogene-mediated alteration in the DNA replication and DNA damage response (DDR) pathways, focusing on lung cancers. We further extend this molecular connection towards cytosolic DNA accumulation, innate immune activation and senescence in RAS-addicted cancers. At the end, we briefly speculate on the potential strategies for targeting RAS mutated lung cancers, considering various approaches targeting DNA replication, DNA repair and the cGAS-STING pro-inflammatory pathway. These new lines of therapy, especially when used in combinations, may enhance treatment efficacy and overcome the challenges associated with these mutations.",

          "abstract": "Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs), the most common malignancies affecting young men, are characterized by high sensitivity to cisplatin-based chemotherapy, which leads to high cure rates even in metastatic disease. However, approximately 30% of patients with metastatic TGCTs relapse after first-line treatment and those who can be defined as platinum-refractory patients face a very dismal prognosis with only limited chemotherapy-based treatment options and an overall survival of few months. Hence, to understand the mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance is crucial for developing new treatment strategies. This narrative review explores the potential role of PARP inhibitors (PARPis) in overcoming cisplatin resistance in TGCTs, starting from the rationale of their ability to induce DNA damage in cells with homologous recombination repair (HRR). Thus far, PARPis have failed to show meaningful clinical activity in platinum-refractory TGCT patients, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. However, few responses to PARPis in TGCTs have been detected in patients with BRCA1/2, ATM or CHEK2 mutations, reinforcing the idea that patients should be optimally selected for tailored treatments in the era of personalized medicine. Future preclinical and clinical research is needed to further investigate the molecular mechanisms of cisplatin resistance and to identify novel therapeutic strategies in resistant/refractory TGCTs patients.",

          "abstract": "Patients with high-grade serous carcinoma of tubo-ovarian origin (HGSC) often experience significant side effects related to their disease and treatments, such as pain, discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Over the last two decades, the use of cannabinoids (CBD) to manage pain and anxiety has become more mainstream. However, there is limited data on how CBD interacts with HGSC tumor cells or whether CBD impacts the effect of chemotherapy. Prior preclinical data has suggested the antitumor benefits of cannabinoids; however, the mechanism and data in ovarian cancer are limited. The objectives of this proposed research are to define the endocannabinoid system milieu in ovarian cancer, determine if CBD influences the growth of ovarian cancer cells, measure the cell viability when cannabinoids such as CBD are combined with standard-of-care therapies, and identify potential molecular pathways in which cannabinoids have a therapeutic effect. We conducted publicly available database searches, in vitro proliferation and apoptotic assays, functional protein signaling via reverse phase protein array analysis of CBD-treated cells using 2D cultured cells, and immunohistological analysis of ex vivo cultured patient-derived tumor slices treated with CBD. Our data suggests that CBD is unlikely to affect the growth of cancer cells at physiologic doses but promotes apoptosis and can have growth inhibitory effects at higher concentrations. The inhibitory effects seen at high dose concentrations are likely from the upregulation of apoptotic pathways and inhibition of oncogenic pathways. Overall, physiologic CBD levels have minimal impact on cancer cell growth or chemotherapy efficacy.",

The molecular mechanisms of MBD2 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remain insufficiently characterized. This study sought to assess the clinical relevance of MBD2 expression in HNSCC, with a particular focus on elucidating its functional role in tumor progression and its regulatory influence on p21 expression and cellular proliferation. We analyzed the relationships between MBD2 expression, clinicopathological features, and survival outcomes in HNSCC patients using data from the UALCAN, TCGA, and cBioPortal databases. The functional role of MBD2 in HNSCC was further investigated through in\u00a0vitro experiments. p21 expression was assessed using western blotting and qRT-PCR in TU212 and AMC-HN8 cells. These cells were treated with either shRNA targeting MBD2, 5-azacytidine (5-Aza), or a combination of shRNA MBD2 and 5-Aza. Additionally, cell proliferation and viability were measured in each treatment group. MBD2 was found to be frequently overexpressed in HNSCC tissues, and its altered expression was significantly associated with reduced overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Both shRNA-mediated MBD2 knockdown and 5-Aza treatment increased p21 expression in HNSCC cells, exhibiting similar functions with additive effects. Furthermore, both treatments significantly inhibited cell proliferation and viability. These results indicated that shRNA-mediated MBD2 knockdown suppresses HNSCC cell growth by upregulating p21 expression. In addition to its role as an oncogene, MBD2 may serve as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HNSCC patients.",

          "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, accurate clinical markers are still lacking. The development of prognostic and predictive indicators, particularly in the context of personalized medicine, could significantly improve CRC patient management. In this retrospective study, we used FFPE blocks of tissue samples from CRC patients at Augusta University (AU) to quantify a custom 15-gene panel. To differentiate the tumor and adjacent normal regions (NAT), H&E staining was utilized. For the quantification of transcripts, we used the NanoString nCounter platform. Kaplan-Meier and Log-rank tests were used to perform survival analyses. Several independent datasets were explored to validate the gene signature. Orthogonal analyses included single-cell profiling, differential gene expression, immune cell deconvolution, neoantigen prediction, and biological pathway assessment. A 3-gene signature (GTF3A, PKM, and VEGFA) was found to be associated with overall survival in the AU cohort (HR\u2009=\u20092.26, 95% CI 1.05-4.84, p\u2009=\u20090.02, 93 patients), TCGA cohort (HR\u2009=\u20091.57, 95% CI 1.05-2.35, p\u2009<\u20090.02, 435 patients) and four other GEO datasets. Independent single-cell analysis identified relatively higher expression of the 3-gene signature in the tumor region. Differential analysis revealed dysregulated tissue inflammation, immune dysfunction, and neoantigen load of cell cycle processes among high-risk patients compared to low-risk patients. We developed a 3-gene signature with the potential for prognostic and predictive clinical assessment of CRC patients. This gene-based stratification offers a cost-effective approach to personalized cancer management. Further research using similar methods could identify therapy-specific gene signatures to strengthen the development of personalized medicine for CRC patients.",

Here, we demonstrate that knockout of Fbxo45 in mouse alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells leads to spontaneous LUAD. Our findings reveal that FBXO45 is a novel cell-cycle-regulated protein that is degraded upon phosphorylation by CDK1 during the S/G2 phase. During the S phase or DNA damage repair, FBXO45 binds to UPF1 and recruits the phosphatase PPP6C, thereby inhibiting UPF1 phosphorylation. This process is crucial for preventing the degradation of replication-dependent (RD) histone mRNAs and ensuring an adequate histone supply. In the absence of FBXO45, the impaired interaction between PPP6C and UPF1 results in sustained hyperphosphorylation of UPF1 throughout the cell cycle, leading to an insufficient histone supply, chromatin relaxation, genomic instability, and an increased rate of gene mutations, ultimately culminating in malignant transformation. Notably, analysis of clinical LUAD specimens confirms a positive correlation between the loss of FBXO45 and genomic instability, which is consistent with our findings in the mouse model. These results highlight the critical role of FBXO45 as a genomic guardian in coordinating histone supply and DNA replication, providing valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets and strategies for the treatment of LUAD.",

Here, we use a genome-wide approach to modulate canonical androgen response element (ARE) motifs-the classic DNA binding elements for AR-to delineate distinct AR transcriptional programs. We find that activating these AREs promotes differentiation and growth-suppressive transcription, potentially leading to AR<sup>+</sup> PCa cell death, while ARE repression is tolerated by PCa cells but deleterious to normal prostate cells. Gene signatures driven by ARE activity correlate with improved prognosis and luminal phenotypes in PCa patients.

We trained and tested the LRMAHpan BA (binding affinity) and the LRMAHpan AP (antigen processing) models using mass spectrometry data, subsequently combined them into the LRMAHpan PS (presentation score) model. Our approach is based on a novel pHLA encoding method that enables the integration of neoantigen prediction tasks into computer vision methods. This method aggregates MA data into a multichannel matrix and incorporates peptide sequences to efficiently capture binding signals. LRMAHpan outperforms standard predictors such as NetMHCpan 4.1, MHCflurry 2.0, and TransPHLA in terms of positive predictive value (PPV) when applied to MA data. Additionally, it can accommodate peptides of variable lengths and predict HLA class I and II presentation. We also predicted neoantigens in a cohort of metastatic melanoma patients, identifying several shared neoantigens.

Nevertheless, a comprehensive investigation between DHX34 and pan-cancer remains unexplored. <b>Methods:</b> We analyzed the value of DHX34 in pan-cancer based on some databases, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and The Human Protein Atlas (HPA) by use the R language as well as some online analysis tools, including STRING, TISIDB, TISCH2. And based on our samples we performed Western blot (WB), qPCR and immunohistochemical staining (IHC) experiments. <b>Results:</b> DHX34 was highly expressed in most tumors, including Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC), compared to corresponding normal tissues. Among cervical cancers, DHX34 mutation frequency was the highest. Intriguingly, a positive correlation was observed between DHX34 expression and Mutational Burden (TMB) across 12 tumor types, and Microsatellite Instability (MSI) across 10 tumor types. Remarkably, DHX34 exhibited a favorable diagnostic value in a multitude of tumors. High expression of DHX34 is associated with poor prognosis in tumors such as adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), low-grade glioma (LGG), and LIHC. Correlation analysis indicated that DHX34 expression correlated with clinicopathological features in a variety of tumors. The Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network and GSCALite database suggested that DHX34 and its ten co-expression genes might promote cancer progression by regulating the cell cycle. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) results further showed that DHX34 was positively correlated with pathways such as cell cycle, mitosis, and gene transcription regulation. The TISIDB database showed that DHX34 expression was closely associated with immune infiltration. Based on the TISCH2 database, we found that DHX34 was expressed in a number of immune cells, with relatively high expression in monocyte macrophages in LIHC. <b>Conclusions:</b> In summary, our study found that DHX34 is highly expressed in pan-cancer and has diagnostic and prognostic value. Targeting DHX34 may improve the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy and chemotherapy in a multitude of tumors.",

GEPIA and cBioPortal were used to analyze selenoprotein expression and mutations and copy number variations. Kaplan-Meier plotter and the tumor immune estimation resource were used to evaluate the impact of these genes on clinical prognosis and their correlation with tumor immune infiltration. Compared with normal tissues, the expression of iodothyronine deiodinase 3 (DIO3), glutathione peroxidase 4, SECISBP2, SELM, and SELP was decreased in the four gynecological malignancies. In OV, selenoprotein had the highest number of mutations (309) and mutation frequency (52.91%), whereas the lowest was observed in endometrial cancer (29.72%). DIO3, selenoprotein O (SELO), and selenoprotein T (SELT) are significantly related to the prognosis of OV. Immune infiltration analysis showed that DIO3 was associated with tumor-associated macrophages, SELO with CD4+ T-cells and monocytes, and SELT with T-cells. Enrichment analysis revealed that DIO3 is mainly involved in inflammatory immune responses and the Ras signaling pathway, SELO is primarily related to innate immune responses, and SELT is closely associated with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This study explored the expression characteristics of 25 selenoprotein in patients with gynecological malignancies and found that DIO3, SELO, and SELT were significantly associated with the prognosis and clinical features of OV, which are potential therapeutic targets.",

The work aims to use bioinformatics methods to mine Nerve-cancer crosstalk-related genes (NCCGs) in pancreatic cancer and evaluate their correlation with tumor stage and prognosis, thereby providing a new direction of development and experimental basis for pancreatic cancer treatment. This study included 185 individuals with PDAC from the TCGA database, together with clinical and RNA sequencing data. A review of prior studies revealed the mechanism of neural-cancer crosstalk and identified 42 neural-cancer crosstalk-related genes (NCCGs). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that NGFR (OR=39.076, 95% CI; P<0.05), CHRNB2 (OR=41.076, 95% CI; P<0.05), and CHRNA10 (OR=39.038, 95% CI; P<0.05) were identified as independent risk factors for PNI development. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that CHRNA10 was negatively connected with PDAC microsatellite instability, whereas CHRNA10, CHRNB2, and NGFR were negatively correlated with PDAC tumor mutation burden. The GEPIA database revealed that CHRNB2 expression was higher in stage I PDAC. The pancreatic cancer single-cell dataset PAAD_CRA001160 revealed that malignant tumor cells, ductal cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts accounted for a large proportion in the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, the NGFR gene was shown to be more significantly expressed in various pancreatic cancer cells. Bioinformatics analysis was used to create a validated prognostic model of pancreatic cancer, which explored the critical mechanisms of neural-tumor interactions and revealed the potential of cancer-neural crosstalk-related genes as prognostic biomarkers and anti-tumor therapy targets.",

Although PLK1 inhibition in experimental models has shown potent antitumor effects, translation to the clinic has been hampered by low antitumor activity and tumor relapse. Here, we report the identification of mitochondrial protein signatures that determine the sensitivity to approaches targeting PLK1 in human melanoma cell lines. In response to PLK1 inhibition or gene silencing, resistant cells adopt a pro-inflammatory and dedifferentiated phenotype, whereas sensitive cells undergo apoptosis. Mitochondrial DNA depletion and silencing of the ABCD1 transporter sensitize cells to PLK1 inhibition and attenuate the associated pro-inflammatory response. We also found that nonselective inhibitors of the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) exert their antiproliferative and pro-inflammatory effects via PLK1 inhibition. Specific inhibition of RSK, on the other hand, is anti-inflammatory and promotes a program of antigen presentation. This study reveals the overlooked effects of PLK1 on phenotype switching and suggests that mitochondrial precision medicine can help improve the response to targeted therapies.",

Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) cancers\u00a0are susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Survival outcomes for patients with MSI-H PDAC are unknown as the disease is rare. This study included patients with PDACs surgically resected from 1990 to 2023, and those with germline or sporadic pathogenic variants in DNA mismatch repair genes were identified. The study matched MSI-H, mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd), and Lynch syndrome (LS)-associated PDAC cases (on age, gender, and year of surgery) with microsatellite-stable (MSS), mismatch repair-proficient, or non-LS-associated PDAC cases in a 1:2 ratio. A generalized estimating equation Cox model with a robust sandwich estimator was used to compare overall survival (OS) in the matched cohorts. Of 936 cases, 18 were included. Eight cases were MSI-H/MMRd, two were MSI/IHC-indeterminate, seven were MSS, and one was not tested for MSI. Nine patients had LS (MLH1 [n = 1], MSH2 [n = 4], MSH6 [n = 1], PMS2 [n = 3]), and nine patients had sporadic pathogenic variants in DNA MMR genes (MLH1 [n = 4], MSH6 [n = 5]). After matching to 36 control patients, the MSI-H/MMRd/LS PDACs had a significantly better OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.36 [95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18-0.73; p = 0.005]; 5-year OS: MSI-H 77% [95% CI 58-100%] vs. MSS 27% [95% CI 15-51%]). Before routine use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, the patients with MSI-H, MMRd, and LS-associated PDACs displayed significantly better survival than the patients with MSS, MMR-proficient, non-LS-associated PDACs. It is expected that survival for this cohort will further improve with increased availability of immunotherapy.",

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between PBK knockdown GIC and control groups were screened through bioinformatics methods. The authors analyzed the mechanisms and roles of these DEGs in GBM tumorigenesis and patient prognosis. Microarray data (GSE53800) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, selecting 18 GIC cell line samples with or without PBK knockdown. Each control and knockdown group contained three samples. DEGs were screened using R software. GO enrichment analysis, KEGG pathway analysis, PPI network analysis, and hub gene identification were conducted to explore DEG mechanisms. Western blot analysis was also performed to detect EIF4E protein expression, one of the key hub genes, after PBK knockdown in the HS683 glioma cell line. A total of 175 upregulated and 145 downregulated genes were identified. GO analysis showed that DEGs were mainly enriched in the positive regulation of cell proliferation, cell adhesion, and angiogenesis. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that DEGs were mainly involved in neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, calcium signaling, and HIF-1 signaling pathways. Western blot results indicated that EIF4E was downregulated after PBK knockdown. A group of genes, such as EIF4E, were closely associated with PBK expression and functions. These findings may provide insight into the molecular mechanism of PBK in GBM.",

We obtained GBM transcriptome and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database on the UCSC Xena platform to perform differential and enrichment analyses of genes in the <i>SUV39H1</i> high- and low-expression groups to construct a prognostic risk model. Analysis of <i>SUV39H1</i> related biological processes in GBM was performed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA). High- and low-risk subgroup mutation signatures were analyzed using maftools. Immune infiltration was evaluated using IOBR and CIBERSORT algorithms. We analyzed the cell types and intercellular communication networks in glioma stem cells (GSCs) using scRNA-seq. The effects on GBM cells and GSCs after inhibition of <i>SUV39H1</i> were investigated in vitro. <i>SUV39H1</i> was significantly overexpressed in GBM and associated with poor prognosis. <i>SUV39H1</i>-related differentially expressed genes were enriched in immune and inflammation related pathways, and GSEA revealed that these genes were significantly enriched in signaling pathways such as IL-18, oxidative phosphorylation, and regulation of TP53 activity. Mutational analysis revealed frequent alterations in TP53 and PTEN expression. In addition, the infiltration abundances of the five immune cell types were significantly different between the high- and low-expression groups. Analysis of cellular communication networks by scRNA-seq revealed a strong interaction between CRYAB-GSC and PTPRZ1-GSC in GSCs. In vitro experiments verified that knockdown of <i>SUV39H1</i> inhibited the viability and proliferation of U87 and U251 glioblastoma cells and downregulated the expression of stemness markers Nestin and SOX2 in CSC1589 and TS576 GSC lines. Increased <i>SUV39H1</i> expression is associated with immune cell infiltration and poor prognosis in patients with GBM. Inhibition of <i>SUV39H1</i> restrains GBM growth and reduces the stem cell properties of GSC. Thus, <i>SUV39H1</i> might be a prognostic predictor and immunotherapeutic target in patients with GBM.",

Its unique role in tumor progression is highly important for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients with tumors. We searched for NTRK fusion-positive patients in our hospital. As of August 2022, a total of 8 patients were affected. We discovered that NTRK fusion was associated with enhanced tumor invasion and migration ability. Previous reports also support this finding, but its underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. We undertook a comprehensive exploration of the correlations between NTRK fusions and tumor invasion as well as migration by analysing clinical data, performing bioinformatics analysis via public databases, and conducting in vitro cell experiments. We ascertained that within the thyroid cancer\u00a0(THCA) dataset and the pancancer dataset, ECM1 and NOVA1 were coexpressed with NTRKs. Additionally, they demonstrated a significant association with the activity of the epithelial\u2012mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Furthermore, these genes are overexpressed in various cancers and are associated with advanced clinical stage and increased aggressiveness. Our in vitro study revealed that larolutinib potentially inhibited the invasion and metastasis ability of NTRK-fused cells. Interestingly, contrary to previous findings, the repression of ECM1 increased the migration and invasion ability of NTRK-fused tumor cells. NTRK fusion tumors present heightened migratory and invasive potential in clinical settings. Further experiments confirmed the significant inhibitory effects of TRK inhibitors on the migration and invasion abilities of these cells. There is a complex relationship between ECM1, NOVA1 and NTRK fusion; however, further research is needed to determine whether NTRK fusion promotes tumor metastasis through these two genes.",

          "abstract": "The transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) channel family has been previously implicated in various diseases, including those related to temperature sensing, cardiovascular health, and neurodegeneration. Nowadays, increasing evidence indicates that TRPM family members also play significant roles in various types of cancers, exhibiting both pro- and anti-tumorigenic functions. They are involved in tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis, serving as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for cancer. This paper begins by describing the structure and physiological functions of the TRPM family members. It then outlines their roles in several common malignancies, including pancreatic, prostate, colorectal, breast, brain cancer, and melanoma. Subsequently, we focused on investigating the specific mechanisms by which TRPM family members are involved in tumorigenesis and development from both the tumor microenvironment (TME) and intracellular signaling. TRPM channels not only transmit signals from the TME to regulate tumor cell functions, but also mediate extracellular matrix remodeling, which is conducive to the malignant transformation of tumor cells. Importantly, TRPM channels depend on the regulation of the inflow of various ions in cells, and participate in key signaling pathways involved in tumor progression, such as Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, MAPK, PI3K/AKT, p53, and autophagy. Finally, we summarize the current strategies and challenges of targeting TRPM channels in tumor treatment, and discuss the feasibility of combining targeted TRPM channel drugs with cancer immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "There are three distinct forms of autophagy, namely, macroautophagy, microautophagy, and HSPA8 chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). While macroautophagy is widely recognized as a regulator of chromosomal instability (CIN) through various pathways, the contributions of CMA and microautophagy to CIN remain uncertain. <i>TTC28</i>, a conserved gene in vertebrates, is frequently mutated and down-regulated in numerous human cancers. This study presents findings demonstrating the interaction between human tetratricopeptide repeat domain 28 (TTC28) and heat shock protein member 8 (HSPA8) and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A proteins. The tetratricopeptide repeat domains of TTC28 bind to the C-terminal motif (PTIEEVD) in HSPA8, resulting in the subsequent degradation of TTC28 via CMA/microautophagy. Notably, the baseline frequency of micronuclei (FMN) in human cancer cells with <i>TTC28</i> knockout cells was three times greater than that in cells with wild-type <i>TTC28</i> (7.7% vs. 2.3%, <i>P</i> = 4.86E-09). Furthermore, the overexpression of Ttc28 mitigated the impact of <i>TTC28</i> knockout on FMN (11.9% vs. 4.8%, <i>P</i> = 2.83E-11). Our findings also demonstrate that CMA has a protective effect on genome stability and that TTC28 plays an essential role in the effect of CMA. These results were further supported by the quantification of \u03b3H2AX and comet analyses and the analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data via bioinformatics. Mechanistically, TTC28 regulates mitosis and cytokinesis, which are involved in the maintenance of genome integrity by CMA. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that TTC28 is not only an HSPA8-mediated CMA/microautophagy substrate but also essential for maintaining chromosomal stability via CMA. Comprehensive TTC28 downregulation may lead to CIN in cancer cells.",

Nevertheless, new roles and mechanisms of PHLDA1 action have come to light, with some needing further clarification. The major aim of the publication is to review proapoptotic or antiapoptotic roles of PHLDA1 in cancer, including ample evidence on PHLDA1 role as a tumor suppressor gene or oncogene and its influence on tumor progression. The role of PHLDA1 as a prognostic marker of cancer emerges, as well as its role in drug response and resistance. PHLDA1 involvement in autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, pyroptosis, or differentiation is also scrutinized. It is also important to note that the association of PHLDA1 with miRNA regulation is described. Additionally, the emerging functions of PHLDA1 are indicated, specifically in inflammation and ischemia/reperfusion injury.",

          "abstract": "Targeted therapy has considerable promise for the effective eradication of cancer at the primary tumor site prior to subsequent metastasis. Using this therapeutic approach, gaining an understanding of mechanistic cancer models is essential for facilitating the inhibition or suppression of tumor growth. Among different oncogenes and proteins, the protein interacting with never-in-mitosis kinase-1 (Pin1) is particularly important. The interaction between Pin1 and phosphorylated threonine-proline motifs results in significant alterations in protein structure and function. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the processes involving Pin1 and its mechanisms in the context of cancer therapy. Pin1 enhances signaling pathways in a number of different human cancers and plays a pivotal role in the suppressive mechanisms relevant to cancer treatment. It is essential for the regulation of proline-directed phosphorylation and for modulating tumor suppressors. Inhibitors of Pin1, particularly naturally occurring substances, have been found to inhibit the carcinogenic activity of Pin1, and consequently this protein could represent an excellent candidate for novel cancer treatment strategies, offering a valuable therapeutic target in carcinogenesis and treatment resistance.",

While PD-1 based immunotherapies overall have led to improved treatment outcomes for this disease, a diverse response to frontline chemotherapy and immunotherapy still exist in TNBC, highlighting the need for more robust prognostic markers. Tumor-intrinsic immunotranscriptomics, serum cytokine profiling, and tumor burden studies were conducted in two syngeneic mouse models to assess differential effects in both the early-stage and metastatic setting. Bioinformatic analyses of both early and metastatic TNBC patient data were performed to assess if identified NF-\u03baB-associated factors are associated with improved patient clinical outcomes. NF-\u03baB signaling driven by lymphotoxin beta expression is associated with tumor regression in TNBC mouse models. Furthermore, lymphotoxin beta expression in patient TNBC cohorts is prognostic of improved survival outcomes. This study highlights the potential role for NF-\u03baB-associated factors, specifically lymphotoxin beta to be used as prognostic markers in TNBC, which could ultimately provide insight for improved targeted treatment approaches in the clinic.",

Despite modest 5-year survival gains, the integration of molecular personalization lags behind and there is an urgent need to develop novel therapies and biomarkers. This study outlined the somatic mutational profile of 15 HNSCC-enriched genes in a case series from North-eastern Italy, the region with the highest national HNSCC incidence. We conducted a comparative analysis with prior case studies and assessed the prognostic implications of the mutations that we found in these genes. Consistent with previous studies, oral cavity tumours showed a lower gene mutation frequency. We highlighted a significant enrichment of somatic AJUBA mutations in the hypopharyngeal region, linked to a poorer prognosis. Moreover, KMT2C mutations co-occurring with CDKN2A or NOTCH1 mutations were associated with a worse prognosis. At the same time, only 7 % of the cases exhibited mutations that are predictive biomarker in HNSCC according to compelling clinical evidence but that need further investigation in a clinical trial setting. Our findings underlined novel differences in somatic gene mutations among the four anatomic sites. However, at present, the identified mutations cannot yet be considered predictive biomarkers either for the lack of supporting clinical findings or for the lack of approved targeted therapies in HNSCC. This underscores the imperative for continued investigation into the biology of HNSCC to unveil novel vulnerabilities that can be leveraged to enhance patient treatment strategies.",

Biomarkers predicting this necessity can guide chemotherapy-free treatment to minimize unnecessary toxicity. Treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy (ICI-mono), chemotherapy, or combination (ICI-chemo), 790 low PD-L1-expressing nsqNSCLCs (in-house: n=83; public: n=707) were analyzed for development and validation of the interaction score for additional chemotherapy (ISAC). Transcriptomic (public, n=11) and multiplex immunofluorescence data (in-house, n=100) were analyzed to evaluate the immune microenvironment. ICI-chemo, compared with ICI-mono, tended to prolong progression-free survival (PFS; HR=0.72, p=0.004) and overall survival (OS; HR=0.77, p=0.071) as first-line therapy in low PD-L1-expressing nsqNSCLCs. The added value of chemotherapy was observed in the ISAC-low subgroup (PFS: HR=0.48, p<0.001; OS: HR=0.53, p=0.001) rather than the ISAC-high subgroup (PFS: HR=1.08, p=0.65; OS: HR=1.14, p=0.56). This predictive utility was independent of tumor mutational burden and PD-L1 expression, indicated by subgroup and multivariable analyses. A high ISAC was associated with adaptive immune resistance reflected by more proinflammatory (eg, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and M1 macrophages) rather than anti-inflammatory tumor-infiltrating immune cells (eg, M2 macrophages) and high expression of immune checkpoints except for PD-L1 (eg, programmed cell death protein-1). A high ISAC was identified as a significant predictor for virtually no added value of platinum-doublet chemotherapy for first-line ICI treatment in low PD-L1-expressing nsqNSCLC. Our findings may help refine personalized therapeutic strategies for nsqNSCLC, thereby improving efficacy and reducing undue toxicity.",

Sequence divergence between repeats causes RMD suppression and indeed this divergence must be resolved in the RMD products. The mismatch repair factor, MLH1, was shown to be critical for both RMD suppression and a polarity of sequence divergence resolution in RMDs. Here, we sought to study the interrelationship between these two aspects of RMD regulation (i.e., RMD suppression and polar divergence resolution), by examining several mutants of MLH1 and its binding partner PMS2. To begin with, we show that PMS2 is also critical for both RMD suppression and polar resolution of sequence divergence in RMD products. Then, with six mutants of the MLH1-PMS2 heterodimer, we found several different patterns: three mutants showed defects in both functions, one mutant showed loss of RMD suppression but not polar divergence resolution, whereas another mutant showed the opposite, and finally one mutant showed loss of RMD suppression but had a complex effect on polar divergence resolution. These findings indicate that RMD suppression vs. polar resolution of sequence divergence are distinct functions of MLH1-PMS2.",

Polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) is emerging as a powerful pro-oncogenic factor in bladder and liver cancer; however, no pan-cancer analysis is presently available. Our study aimed to explore PTBP1 expression profiles, prognostic immunological value, and biological functions across various cancers. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using multi-omics bioinformatics from public databases, including TIMER, GEPIA2, ProteinAtlas, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, PrognoScan, cBioPortal, STRING, ENCORI, TargetScan, and DAVID. We found that PTBP1 was overexpressed across multiple cancer types. qRT-PCR results demonstrated that the PTBP1 mRNA was significantly up-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), colon cancer (COAD), and melanoma (SKCM) cell lines, as well as in melanoma-forming mouse models. Higher PTBP1 mRNA levels were associated with poorer survival probabilities in several cancer types. PTBP1 genetic alterations were related to amplification and mutation. PTBP1 significantly modulates tumor immunity by enhancing Tregs infiltration and reducing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activity, promoting immune evasion and adversely affecting cancer prognosis. GO and KEGG pathway analyses implied that PTBP1 may participate in RNA metabolism, the spliceosome, the cell cycle, and the p53 signaling pathway in cancer development. Our study is the first to demonstrate the oncogenic role of PTBP1 in a pan-cancer context. PTBP1 might serve as a new biomarker for prognostic prediction and immune cell infiltration across cancers in the future.",

This study was designed to analyze the expression status and prognostic significance of EPHA2 in pan-cancer. By mining The Cancer Genome Atlas data, we performed a comprehensive and systematic characterization of EPHA2 across >10,000 samples of 33 types of cancer. EPHA2 expressions were substantially different in most of the normal control and tumor tissues, and it was considerably associated with the prognosis of tumor patients. EPHA2 gene modifications in malignant tumors were mainly missense mutations. There was a significant correlation between EPHA2 expression and cancer-associated fibroblasts in most The Cancer Genome Atlas cancers. Furthermore, functional enrichment analysis showed that the biological role of EPHA2 in tumors was mainly involved in some noticeably pro-oncogenic pathways, such as the Ras signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, ErbB signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, etc. This study provided the first pan-cancer analyses of EPHA2 in various tumors, and EPHA2 was potentially involved in many cancer types and can be developed as candidates for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic biomarkers.

We previously proposed that this phosphorylation is associated with cell migration and cancer aggressiveness, distinguishing IGF-1R activity from that of insulin receptor, which lacks these tyrosines. Here, we further investigated how adhesion signaling influences IGF-1R location and activity in migratory cancer cells and R- fibroblasts. We observed that IGF-1R, in triple-negative breast cancer tissues, is predominantly intracellular and dispersed from the plasma membrane compared with nontumor tissue. Datasets from basal-like breast cancer patients indicated a strong, positive correlation between IGF-1R protein expression and that of \u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin (ITGB1). In triple-negative breast cancer cells with high ITGB1 expression, suppressing ITGB1 enhanced IGF-1R stability and its retention at the plasma membrane, and reduced IGF-1R internalization during cell adhesion. In R- fibroblasts, we observed reduced IGF-1R autophosphorylation and Golgi accumulation when ITGB1 was suppressed. The stability of a Tyr<sup>1250/1251</sup>Phe (FF) IGF-1R mutant was less affected by ITGB1 suppression, indicating that Tyr<sup>1250/1251</sup> phosphorylation is required for ITGB1-enhanced receptor internalization. Furthermore, a Tyr<sup>1250/1251</sup>Glu (EE) IGF-1R mutant exhibited a gain of cell migration and colony formation potential compared to WT IGF-1R or FF mutant. Tyr<sup>1250/1251</sup> resides within the CT <sup>1248</sup>SFYYS<sup>1252</sup> motif, which engages the IGF-1R kinase domain. In silico, we investigated how mutation of these tyrosines may alter <sup>1248</sup>SFYYS<sup>1252</sup> conformation, dictating trajectory of the distal CT.

Through bulk RNA sequencing of human tumors, we identified a strong correlation between WNT7A expression and reduced CD8+ T-cell infiltration. Further investigation demonstrated that inhibiting WNT7A substantially enhanced MHC-I expression on tumor cells. Mechanistically, WNT7A inhibition inactivated the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway and thus resulted in reduced physical interaction between \u03b2-catenin and p65 in the cytoplasm, which increased the nuclear translocation of p65 and activated the NF-\u03baB pathway, ultimately promoting the transcription of genes encoding MHC-I molecules. We found that our lead compound, 1365-0109, disrupted the protein-protein interaction between WNT7A and its receptor FZD5, resulting in the upregulation of MHC-I expression. In murine tumor models, both genetic and pharmaceutical suppression of WNT7A led to increased MHC-I levels on tumor cells, and consequently enhanced the infiltration and functionality of CD8+ T cells, which bolstered antitumor immunity and improved the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade therapy. These findings have elucidated the intrinsic mechanisms of WNT7A-induced immune suppression, suggesting that therapeutic interventions targeting WNT7A hold promise for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "SETD2 is known to be the unique histone methyltransferase responsible for the trimethylation of the lysine 36 of histone H3 thus generating H3K36me3. This epigenetic mark is critical for transcriptional activation and elongation, DNA repair, mRNA splicing, and DNA methylation. Recurrent SETD2-inactivating mutations and altered H3K36me3 levels are found in cancer at high frequency and numerous studies indicate that SETD2 acts as a tumor suppressor. Recently, SETD2 was further shown to methylate non-histone proteins particularly the cytoskeletal proteins tubulin and actin with subsequent impacts on cytoskeleton structure, mitosis and cell migration. Herein, we provide a review of the role of SETD2 in different cancers with special emphasis on the structural basis of the functions of this key lysine methyltransferase. Moreover, beyond the role of this enzyme in epigenetics and H3K36me3-dependent processes, we highlight the putative role of \"non-epigenetic/H3K36me3\" functions of SETD2 in cancer, particularly those involving the cytoskeleton.",

          "abstract": "Macrophages are pivotal in driving breast tumor development, progression, and resistance to treatment, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumors, where they infiltrate the tumor microenvironment (TME) influenced by cancer cell-secreted factors. By analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data from 25 ER+ tumors, we elucidated interactions between cancer cells and macrophages, correlating macrophage density with epithelial cancer cell density. We identified that S100A11, a previously unexplored factor in macrophage-cancer crosstalk, predicts high macrophage density and poor outcomes in ER+ tumors. We found that recombinant S100A11 enhances macrophage infiltration and migration in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, in a 3D matrix using a panel of three ER+ breast cancer cell lines, we showed that secreted S100A11 levels from cancer cells were associated with increased monocyte infiltration that subsequently differentiation toward macrophages. Genetic silencing of S100A11 in the S100A11-high T47D cancer cells reduced monocyte infiltration, consistent with results using a S100A11 blocking antibody in T47D cancer cells and in a clinically relevant patient-derived organoid model. Phenotypic analysis of macrophages cocultured with T47D cancer cells following S100A11 knockdown revealed lower expression of the immunosuppressive marker CD206, further underscoring the role of S100A11 as a paracrine regulator of pro-tumorigenic cancer-macrophage crosstalk. This study offers novel insights into the interplay between macrophages and cancer cells in ER+ breast tumors, highlighting S100A11 as a potential therapeutic target to modulate the macrophage-rich tumor microenvironment.",

          "abstract": "Increasing evidence indicates that Calumenin (CALU), which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, is significantly associated with tumor progression. However, the effect of CALU on patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is unknown. By integrating multi-omics data and molecular biology experiments, we found that CALU expression was significantly increased in tumors compared with normal tissues, and the pathological grade and prognosis of patients were correlated with CALU expression. Next, knockdown or ectopic expression of CALU could affect the proliferative and invasive abilities of ccRCC cells. Moreover, immune landscape characterization revealed that CALU expression was\u00a0positively associated with neutrophils and macrophages, whereas it was negatively associated with natural killer T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Single-cell sequencing showed that the localization and binding targets of CALU mainly involved monocytes/macrophages and CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Sensitivity analysis of common chemotherapeutic drugs showed that high expression of CALU could sensitize chemotherapeutic drugs such as 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol, AMG-706 and Cytarabine, but could lead to drug resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs such as Embelin, Salubrinal and Tipifarnib. We demonstrated a significant correlation between high CALU expression and poor patient survival. Further, we demonstrated a correlation between CALU expression, tumor microenvironment, and the sensitivity of patients to common chemo- and immuno-therapy drugs. Thus, our results indicate that CALU could be a biomarker and designing personalized treatment approaches for ccRCC patients.

Here, we aimed to determine the functional consequences of ALK5 mutations in human endometrial cancer (EC). Somatic mutation data were retrieved from publicly available databases. Using seven in silico algorithms, 78.5% (11 of 14) of ALK5 kinase domain mutations in EC, including A230V-ALK5, were predicted to impact protein function. For in vitro studies, we focused on A230V-ALK5 because it was the only mutated residue located within the ATP-binding pocket, which is an important region for both ATP-binding and binding of ATP-competitive inhibitors. Constructs expressing wildtype-, constitutively-active-, kinase-dead-, or mutant A230V-ALK5, were transfected into NIH/3T3 cells. Following TGF-\u03b21 stimulation, transient exogenous expression of A230V-ALK5 resulted in attenuated SMAD2/3 signal transduction and reduced AKT activation. We further showed that the A230V-ALK5 mutant had reduced stability resulting from increased ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. Our structural modeling predicted that SB-431542, a small molecule ATP-competitive inhibitor of ALK5, binds to the A230V-ALK5 mutant with reduced affinity compared to wildtype-ALK5. We therefore examined the inhibitory effect of SB-431542 and galunisertib on wildtype- and mutant-ALK5 activity using a Smad-binding element (SBE) luciferase reporter assay combined with TGF-\u03b21 stimulation, in NIH/3T3 cells and HEC-265 EC cells. SBE luciferase activity in A230V-ALK5 transfected cells was inhibited less by SB-431542 and galunisertib than in wildtype-ALK5 transfected cells indicating that A230V-ALK5 is less sensitive to inhibition by these agents than wildtype-ALK5, potentially due to changes in SB-431542/A230V-ALK5 binding affinity. Our findings are novel and show that A230V-ALK5 is a partial loss-of-function mutant that attenuates TGF-\u03b21 signal transduction and has reduced sensitivity to ALK5 small molecule inhibitors.",

Radiotherapy is the standard of care but only provides only temporary symptomatic relief due to radioresistance. Although hypoxia is a major driver of radioresistance in other tumors, there is no definitive evidence that DIPGs are hypoxic. Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas often contain histone mutations, which alter tumor metabolism and are also associated with radioresistance. Our objective was to identify the metabolic profiles of DIPG cells, detect hypoxia signatures, and uncover metabolism-linked mechanisms of radioresistance to improve tumor radiosensitivity. Using DIPG models combined with clinical datasets, we examined mitochondrial metabolism and signatures of hypoxia. We explored DIPG reliance on mitochondrial metabolism using extracellular flux assays and targeted metabolomics. In vitro and in vivo models were used to explore the mechanisms of targeting mitochondrial bioenergetics and hypoxia for radiosensitization. Treatment-induced transcriptomics and metabolomics were also investigated. Comprehensive analyses of DIPG cells show signatures of enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). We also identified increased expression of specific OXPHOS-related genes and signatures of hypoxia gene expression in datasets obtained from DIPG patients. We found the presence of hypoxia in orthotopic mouse models bearing DIPG tumors. These findings enabled us to develop a proof-of-concept treatment strategy to enhance radiosensitivity of DIPGs in vitro and in animal models. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma cells rely on mitochondrial metabolism for growth, and targeting mitochondria disrupts bioenergetics, alleviates hypoxia, and enhances radiosensitivity. These findings warrant further exploration of OXPHOS inhibition as a radiosensitizing strategy for DIPG treatment.",

ATX catalyzes the production of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), an important regulator within the tumor microenvironment (TME), yet the protumorigenic action of the ATX/LPA axis in PDAC remains unclear. In this study, by interrogating patient samples and cell line datasets, we show that the PDAC TME, rather than cancer cells, is responsible for the majority of ENPP2 expression and highlight a key role for cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived ATX in autocrine and paracrine protumorigenic signaling. Using the clinical-stage ATX inhibitor, IOA-289, we identified connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), also known as CCN2, as a downstream mediator of ATX signaling in the PDAC CAF-derived cell line, 0082T. Genetic ablation or pharmacologic inhibition of ATX in 0082T CAFs reduced CTGF secretion via modulation of LPA/LPA receptor signaling. Despite the loss of ATX function, extracellular levels of LPA were paradoxically increased, indicating a role for ATX beyond its enzymatic activity and suggesting a role for its LPA chaperone function in the LPA/LPA receptor signaling in CAFs. As CAFs are the main source for CTGF in the PDAC TME, these findings suggest a role for ATX in promoting a protumorigenic microenvironment via modulation of CAF secretion not only via its LPA-producing activity but also via its LPA chaperone function, providing a potential mechanism for the antitumor effects of ATX inhibition.",

However, their precise involvement in colon neoplasia and colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) remains incompletely understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive investigation utilizing multiple databases to explore the multifaceted characteristics of eFGFs. Through integrated analyses of diverse databases, including TIMER2.0, UALCAN, OncoDB, cBioPortal, LinkedOmics, STRING, htfTarget, mirTarBase, circBank, and DGIdb, we explored eFGFs' gene expression, DNA methylation, prognostic significance, genetic alterations, gene regulatory networks, functional analysis, and drug interactions in COAD patients. Our findings revealed elevated expression levels of eFGFs in COAD, with aberrant gene expression potentially linked to promoter methylation. Importantly, hypermethylation of FGF21 and FGF23 and downregulation of FGF23 correlated with poor survival outcomes in COAD patients. Functional analyses highlighted the involvement of eFGF genes in Ras signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling, and cancer pathways. Furthermore, we validated our findings through a cross-sectional study by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), confirming significant overexpression of FGF21 in colon polyps compared to normal mucosa. Additionally, we observed elevated RNA expression of FGF21 and FGF23 in adenomatous polyps compared to hyperplastic polyps. This study sheds new light on the critical roles of eFGFs in COAD tumorigenesis and underscores their potential as promising prognostic markers for COAD, as well as discriminative markers for distinguishing high-risk from low-risk polyps.

The dense ECM in a BMM with decreased plasmin activity entraps insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1 and reduces mTORC2-dependent signaling and proliferation of B-ALL cells. Conversely, B-ALL conditions the BMM to induce hepatic generation of plasminogen, the plasmin precursor. Treatment with \u03b5-aminocaproic acid (EACA), which inhibits plasmin activation, reduces tumor burden and prolongs survival, including in xenogeneic models via increased fibronectin in the BMM.

The effect of hypoxia is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1A (HIF-1A) via targeting various downstream pathways, including glycolysis, angiogenesis, and survival signaling. However, HCC cell lines in a 2-dimensional (2D) setting do not resemble the metabolic signature of HCC. Here we aim to overcome these limitations by developing an HCC organoid that recapitulates the HIF-1A metabolic shift. The enrichment analysis of the RNA-Seq data revealed that HIF-1A-driven glycolytic shift is of the significant pathways. The established organoid model, using xeno-free plasma-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) as a scaffold and nutritive biomatrix, maintained its structural integrity and viability for up to 14\u00a0days; the comparative analysis of the cobalt (II) chloride (CoCl<sub>2</sub>)-treated organoids to the untreated ones unveiled reduced size and proliferative capacity. Interestingly, our organoid model showed an elevated expression of HIF-1A and glycolysis enzymes compared to their counterparts in the CoCl<sub>2</sub>-treated organoids. HIF-1A molecular expression-translated biochemical signature is further assessed in our spontaneously growing organoids showing an increase in glucose uptake, intracellular pyruvate, extracellular lactate dehydrogenase expression, and extracellular lactate production, while hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), a marker for oxidative metabolism, is reduced. Our data confirmed the potency of the established organoid model to mimic the molecular and biochemical HIF-1A-driven metabolism, which validates its potential use as an in vitro HCC model.

However, its expression and function in different types of tumors are not well understood. Comprehensive studies across multiple cancer types are needed to assess the potential of GNL2 as a diagnostic, prognostic, and immunological marker. mRNA expression data, copy number alteration threshold data, masked copy number segmentation data, and DNA methylation 450\u00a0K data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pan-cancer cohort were obtained from the Firehose database. Additional data, including miRNA, The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA), mutation data, and clinical information, were sourced from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Xena database. The cBioPortal database facilitates the examination of GNL2 mutation frequency, location, and 3D structure in the TCGA database. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data verified the transcriptome level expression in the TCGA cohort. Protein expression levels were analyzed via the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) database. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was employed to investigate the biological role of GNL2 across cancers. Multiple immune infiltration algorithms from the TIMER2.0 database were utilized to examine the correlation between GNL2 expression and the tumor immune microenvironment. The transcriptome-wide immune infiltration results were validated using 72 single-cell datasets from the Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub (TISCH) database. Pan-cancer survival maps were constructed, and GNL2 expression in different molecular subtypes across cancers was examined. The relationship between GNL2 and drug resistance was investigated using data from CellMiner, GDSC, and CTRP. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) was used to identify chemicals affecting GNL2 expression. GNL2 is located primarily in the nucleus, and its expression is regulated mainly through somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) and aberrant DNA methylation, according to TCGA data. Database analysis and immunohistochemical results from clinical samples revealed high GNL2 expression in most tumors, which was correlated with diagnostic significance. High GNL2 expression often indicates a poor prognosis with pan-cancer prognostic value. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) suggested that GNL2 is involved in tumor development through cell proliferation-related pathways. GNL2 expression is correlated with the expression of immune-related genes and the infiltration levels of multiple immune cells. The relationships between GNL2 and various drugs and chemicals were examined, revealing its influence on drug sensitivity and identifying five chemicals countering GNL2-mediated pro-cancer effects. Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of GNL2 in pan-cancer tissues, combined with experimental validation, elucidated the pan-cancer expression pattern of GNL2, determined its diagnostic and prognostic value, and explored the biological functions of GNL2. GNL2 may be involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment and is associated with poor prognosis as a risk factor in most tumors. The potential of GNL2-based cancer therapies is emphasized, assisting in predicting the response to chemotherapy.",

          "abstract": "The cytokine IL-18 has immunostimulatory effects but is negatively regulated by a secreted binding protein, IL-18BP, that limits IL-18's anticancer efficacy. A decoy-resistant form of IL-18 (DR-18) that avoids sequestration by IL-18BP while maintaining its immunostimulatory potential has recently been developed. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of DR-18 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Using pantumor transcriptomic data, we found that clear cell RCC had among the highest expression of IL-18 receptor subunits and IL18BP of tumor types in the database. In samples from patients with RCC treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, IL-18BP protein expression increased in the tumor microenvironment and in circulation within plasma in nonresponding patients, and it decreased in the majority of responding patients. We used immunocompetent RCC murine models to assess the efficacy of DR-18 in combination with single- and dual-agent anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4. In contrast to preclinical models of other tumor types, in RCC models, DR-18 enhanced the activity of anti-CTLA-4 but not anti-PD-1 treatment. This activity correlated with intratumoral enrichment and clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells, decreased Treg levels, and enrichment of proinflammatory antitumor myeloid cell populations. Our findings support further clinical investigation of the combination of DR-18 and anti-CTLA-4 in RCC.",

However, the importance of the kinase function of IKK\u03b1 in human physiology remains unknown since no biallelic variants disrupting its kinase activity have been reported. In this study, we present a homozygous germline missense variant in the kinase domain of IKK\u03b1, which is present in three children from two Turkish families. This variant, referred to as IKK\u03b1<sup>G167R</sup>, is in the activation segment of the kinase domain and affects the conserved (DF/LG) motif responsible for coordinating magnesium atoms for ATP binding. As a result, IKK\u03b1<sup>G167R</sup> abolishes the kinase activity of IKK\u03b1, leading to impaired activation of the non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway. Patients carrying IKK\u03b1<sup>G167R</sup> exhibit a range of immune system abnormalities, including the absence of secondary lymphoid organs, hypogammaglobulinemia and limited diversity of T and B cell receptors with evidence of autoreactivity. Overall, our findings indicate that, unlike a nonsense IKK\u03b1 variant that results in early embryonic lethality in humans, the deficiency of IKK\u03b1's kinase activity is compatible with human life. However, it significantly disrupts the homeostasis of the immune system, underscoring the essential and non-redundant kinase function of IKK\u03b1 in humans.",

In this study, we first analyzed the differential gene expression of gastric cancer patients with or without peritoneal metastasis, and identified the HECT domain E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (HECTD2) as the core gene of PM in gastric cancer. The current study shows that the role of HECTD2 in tumor is contradictory. In this study, our results show that the low expression of HECTD2 indicates that the survival rate of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and disease-free survival (DFS) are better, and can be used as an important component of prognostic indicators. In addition, through pathway enrichment analysis, we found that HECTD2 was mainly involved in metastasis related pathways such as extracellular matrix remodeling and cell adhesion in gastric cancer, and high expression of HECTD2 could activate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) metastasis related pathways in gastric cancer. In regulating the metastasis of gastric cancer cells, HECTD2 can also change the surrounding microenvironment, induce the enrichment of interstitial components and build an immune microenvironment conducive to tumor progression, while patients with low expression of HECTD2 may be more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. In conclusion, HECTD2 may be a novel biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer, providing basis for the mechanism of peritoneal metastasis of cancer and clinical medication.",

          "abstract": "Integrating multiple omics datasets can significantly advance our understanding of disease mechanisms, physiology, and treatment responses. However, a major challenge in multi-omics studies is the disparity in sample sizes across different datasets, which can introduce bias and reduce statistical power. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, OmicsNMF, designed to impute missing omics data and enhance disease phenotype prediction. OmicsNMF integrates Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). NMF is a well-established method for uncovering underlying patterns in omics data, while GANs enhance the imputation process by generating realistic data samples. This synergy aims to more effectively address sample size disparity, thereby improving data integration and prediction accuracy. For evaluation, we focused on predicting breast cancer subtypes using the imputed data generated by our proposed framework, OmicsNMF. Our results indicate that OmicsNMF consistently outperforms baseline methods. We further assessed the quality of the imputed data through survival analysis, revealing that the imputed omics profiles provide significant prognostic power for both overall survival and disease-free status. Overall, OmicsNMF effectively leverages GANs and NMF to impute missing samples while preserving key biological features. This approach shows potential for advancing precision oncology by improving data integration and analysis. Source code is available at: https://github.com/compbiolabucf/OmicsNMF.",

Subsequently, TYMS was inhibited using small interfering RNA (siRNA) in four different cell lines, and cell proliferation and migration were assessed using CellTiter-Glo and Transwell assays. TYMS exhibited pronounced expression across a spectrum of cancers and demonstrated associations with clinical outcome in diverse cancer patient cohorts. Furthermore, genetic alterations were identified as potential influencers of overall survival in specific tumor types. Notably, the expression of thymidylate synthase correlated with tumor-infiltrating CD4+ cells in select cancers. Additionally, the functional mechanism of TYMS encompassed nucleotidase activity, chromosome segregation, and DNA replication progress. <i>In vitro</i> experiments further substantiated these findings, demonstrating that the suppression of TYMS impeded the cell growth and invasive capabilities of HeLa, A549, 786-O, and U87_MG cells.

This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the clinical significance, biological roles, and possible mechanisms of INHBA in GC. Expression levels and survival analyses of the Inhibin beta family were assessed using online databases. A prediction model based on INHBA was developed. In addition, the associations between INHBA expression and immune status, and chemotherapy sensitivity were explored. In vitro experiments were conducted to investigate the biological impact of INHBA on GC cells. Pyrosequencing and the DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-AZA-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-dC) were employed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying INHBA function. Our findings revealed that INHBA exhibited high expression in GC patients, and elevated INHBA expression correlated with worse outcomes. We developed a novel nomogram incorporating INHBA, age, and tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage to predict the prognosis of GC patients. Additionally, INHBA was found to be associated with suppressed infiltration of immune cells and chemosensitivity. Functionally, INHBA promoted the proliferation and invasiveness of GC cells. Mechanistically, pyrosequencing revealed DNA Hypomethylation of INHBA in the first exon region, and the effects of INHBA silencing were rescued by 5-AZA-dC treatment.

We investigate the role of alkaline ceramidase 1 (ACER1) and its relationship with immune infiltration in HNSCC. The differential expression and clinical prognostic significance of ACER1 in HNSCC patients are explored using bioinformatics methods and verified in human HNSCC samples. Genetic mutation, DNA methylation and drug sensitivity linked with ACER1 are examined. The potential biological function of ACER1 co-expression genes is assessed, and a series of functional assays are performed on ACER1in vitro. The results comprehensively reveal a relationship between ACER1 and immune infiltration in HNSCC patients. ACER1 expression is significantly downregulated in HNSCC tissues and closely correlated with better prognoses for HNSCC patients, and this prognostic significance is determined by distinct clinical characteristics. Genetic alteration and promoter hypomethylation of ACER1 are involved in progression of HNSCC, and ACER1 expression is significantly related to several drug sensitivities. Functional analysis shows that ACER1 co-expression genes are mainly enriched in the sphingolipid signaling pathway associated with inhibition of tumorigenesis, leading to better prognoses for HNSCC patients. In vitro, ACER1 overexpression inhibits proliferation and migration, induces apoptosis, and promotes adhesion of Fadu and SCC9 cells. In addition, high ACER1 expression is closely linked with infiltration levels of immune cells, and strongly associated with biomarkers of immune cells in HNSCC, suggesting the important role of ACER1 in regulating tumor immunity in HNSCC patients. In summary, ACER1 may be a useful indicator for diagnosis and prognosis, and may regulate immune infiltration in HNSCC patients, thus promising targeted immunotherapy for HNSCC.",

Overall, 120 (64%) cases were classified differently by the ICC and WHO5, including 24 of 80 (30%) cases with <20% blasts. These cases were discrepantly categorized primarily because of inclusion of complex karyotype (CK) as a surrogate for biallelic TP53 inactivation only in the ICC. However, there were no significant differences in clinicopathologic characteristics or overall survival between cases categorized as TP53-mutated disease by both classifications and those with a single TP53 mutation and CK, suggesting that CK reliably identifies TP53-mutated cases with biallelic TP53 inactivation. Most cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 96/102 [94%]) were discrepantly diagnosed between the ICC and WHO5 because of the introduction of AML with mutated TP53 as a distinct category only in the ICC. Nearly all of these were instead diagnosed as AML, myelodysplasia related (AML-MR) by WHO5. However, when compared with a separate cohort of patients with AML-MR without TP53 mutations, patients with TP53-mutated AML showed a distinct genetic profile and significantly worse overall survival, supporting the inclusion of AML with mutated TP53 as a distinct disease category.

          "abstract": "KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> and KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> inhibitors represent a major translational breakthrough for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and cancer in general by directly targeting its most mutated oncoprotein. However, resistance to these small molecules has highlighted the need for rational combination partners necessitating a critical understanding of signaling downstream of KRAS mutant isoforms. We contrasted tumor development between Kras<sup>G12C</sup> and Kras<sup>G12D</sup> genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). To corroborate findings and determine mutant subtype-specific dependencies, isogenic models of Kras<sup>G12C</sup> and Kras<sup>G12D</sup> initiation and adaptation were profiled by RNA sequencing. We also employed cell line models of established KRAS mutant NSCLC and determined therapeutic vulnerabilities through pharmacological inhibition. We analysed differences in survival outcomes for patients affected by advanced KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> or KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>-mutant NSCLC. KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> exhibited higher potency in vivo, manifesting as more rapid lung tumor formation and reduced survival of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> GEMMs compared to KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>. This increased potency, recapitulated in an isogenic initiation model, was associated with enhanced PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling. However, KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> oncogenicity and downstream pathway activation were comparable with KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> at later stages of tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo, consistent with similar clinical outcomes in patients. Despite this, established KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> NSCLC models depended more on the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, while KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> models on the MAPK pathway. Specifically, KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> inhibition was enhanced by AKT inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Our data highlight a unique combination treatment vulnerability and suggest that patient selection strategies for combination approaches using direct KRAS inhibitors should be i) contextualised to individual RAS mutants, and ii) tailored to their downstream signaling.",

However, how mitochondrial dynamics influences metastatic progression remains poorly understood. Here, we show that breast cancer cells with low metastatic potential exhibit a more fused mitochondrial network compared to highly metastatic cells. To study the impact of mitochondrial dynamics on metastasis, we promoted mitochondrial elongation in metastatic breast cancer cells by individual genetic deletion of three key regulators of mitochondrial fission (Drp1, Fis1, Mff) or by pharmacological intervention with leflunomide. Omics analyses revealed that mitochondrial elongation causes substantial alterations in metabolic pathways and processes related to cell adhesion. In vivo, enhanced mitochondrial elongation by loss of mitochondrial fission mediators or treatment with leflunomide notably reduced metastasis formation. Furthermore, the transcriptomic signature associated with elongated mitochondria correlated with improved clinical outcome in patients with breast cancer. Overall, our findings highlight mitochondrial dynamics as a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer.",

Breast cancer, being the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women globally, requires innovative approaches for effective management. Digital Therapeutics (DTx) and Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) have emerged as pivotal technologies, offering personalized, patient-centered care and optimizing clinical decision-making. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the applications, benefits, and challenges of these digital tools in breast cancer treatment. We examine DTx tools' ability to offer real-time symptom monitoring, treatment adherence, psychological support, and lifestyle modification guidance. Simultaneously, the role of CDSSs in providing personalized treatment recommendations, early detection, data analysis, and enhancing multidisciplinary collaborations is evaluated. The challenges of implementing these technologies, such as data privacy, interoperability, and accessibility are also discussed, along with potential solutions. By exploring the current research findings, the review underscores the significant impact of DTx and CDSSs on patient outcomes, treatment efficiency, and overall quality of life. This manuscript concludes with a forward-looking perspective, emphasizing the importance of collaborative efforts to overcome obstacles and unlock the full potential of digital innovations in breast cancer oncology. Our analysis suggests that adopting these digital tools can lead to more holistic, efficient, and patient-centric cancer care, marking a significant shift in the paradigm of breast cancer management.",

One of these, Enolase 1 (ENO1), catalyses glycolysis and is involved in the regulation of multiple signalling pathways. This study aimed to evaluate in silico the prognostic and predictive effects of ENO1 expression in BC. This is a bioinformatic in silico analysis. Using available online platforms (Kaplan-Meier [KM] plotter, receiver operating characteristic curve [ROC] plotter, cBioPortal, Genotype-2-Outcome [G-2-O], MethSurv, and Tumour-Immune System Interaction Database [TISIDB]), we performed a bioinformatic in silico analysis to establish the prognostic and predictive effects related to ENO1 expression in BC. A network analysis was performed using the Oncomine platform, and signalling, epigenetic, and immune regulation pathways were explored. ENO1 was overexpressed in all the analysed Oncomine, epigenetic, and immune pathways in triple-negative, but not in hormone receptor-positive BCs. In human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive BCs, ENO1 expression showed a mixed profile. Analysis on disease progression and histological types showed ENO1 overexpression in ductal in situ and invasive carcinoma, in high-grade tumours followed by advanced or metastasis and was linked to worse survival. High ENO1 expression was also associated with relapse-free, distant metastasis-free and overall survival, irrespectively of treatment and was mainly related to basal subtype. ENO1 overexpression recruits a range of signalling pathways during disease progression conferring a worse prognosis and can be potentially used as a biomarker of disease progression and therapeutic target, particularly in triple-negative and in ductal invasive carcinoma.",

Recent research highlights the crucial roles IL6ST-mediated signaling pathways play in the development and progression of various cancers, particularly through hyperactivated STAT3 signaling. However, the molecular programs mediated by IL6ST/STAT3 in prostate cancer are poorly understood. To investigate the role of IL6ST signaling, we constitutively activated IL6ST signaling in the prostate epithelium of a Pten-deficient prostate cancer mouse model in vivo and examined IL6ST expression in large cohorts of prostate cancer patients. We complemented these data with in-depth transcriptomic and multiplex histopathological analyses. Genetic cell-autonomous activation of the IL6ST receptor in prostate epithelial cells triggers active STAT3 signaling and significantly reduces tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, genetic activation of IL6ST signaling mediates senescence via the STAT3/ARF/p53 axis and recruitment of cytotoxic T-cells, ultimately impeding tumor progression. In prostate cancer patients, high IL6ST mRNA expression levels correlate with better recurrence-free survival, increased senescence signals and a transition from an immune-cold to an immune-hot tumor. Our findings demonstrate a context-dependent role of IL6ST/STAT3 in carcinogenesis and a tumor-suppressive function in prostate cancer development by inducing senescence and immune cell attraction. We challenge the prevailing concept of blocking IL6ST/STAT3 signaling as a functional prostate cancer treatment and instead propose cell-autonomous IL6ST activation as a novel therapeutic strategy.",

NF1 loss may also be a harbinger of exploitable vulnerabilities in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM). Accurate and consistent detection of NF1 loss, however, is fraught given the large gene size, challenges with complete coverage and variant calling upon sequencing, and mechanisms of mRNA and protein regulation that result in early degradation in the absence of genomic alterations. Here, we seek to perform a composite analysis for NF1 loss accounting for genomic alterations and protein expression via immunohistochemistry. We also characterize the landscape of NF1 alterations in GBM. We assembled a single-institution, retrospective cohort of 542 IDH-wildtype GBM with somatic next generation sequencing to investigate the frequency and nature of detected NF1 alterations. We selected 69\u00a0GBMs from which to build a tissue microarray (TMA) of 44 NF1-wildtype and 25 NF1-mutant cases. We performed NF1 immunohistochemistry using two different NF1 antibodies (NFC, Sigma-Aldrich; and iNF-07E, iNFixion Bioscience) and correlated results with clinical, genomic, and other immunohistochemical features. In our retrospective cohort, we identified 88 IDH-wildtype GBM with NF1 alterations (16%). NF1 alterations were mutually exclusive with EGFR and MDM2 alterations (p-adj\u2009<\u20090.001, 0.05, respectively), but co-occurred with PIK3R1 alterations (Log<sub>2</sub>(OR)\u2009=\u2009-\u20091.6, p-adj\u2009=\u20090.03). Of the 63 scorable sporadic GBMs in the TMA, 14 harbored NF1 inactivating alterations and of those, 12 (86%) demonstrated minimal NF1 immunoreactivity by NFC antibody, compared to 8 (57%) by iNF-07E antibody. Among the 42 scorable NF1-wildtype GBM in the TMA, NF1 immunostaining was minimal in 18 (43%) by NFC antibody compared to 4 (10%) by iNF-07E antibody, potentially reflecting false positives or differential protein regulation. Minimal immunoreactivity by NFC antibody was associated with decreased median overall survival (8.5 vs. 16.4\u00a0months, p\u2009=\u20090.011). Cox proportional hazards model correcting for prognostic variables in this subset revealed HR 3.23 (95% CI 1.29-8.06, p\u2009=\u20090.01) associated with decreased NF1 expression by IHC. NF1 immunostaining may serve as a sensitive surrogate marker of NF1 genomic inactivation and a valuable extension to next-generation sequencing for defining NF1 status. Minimal NF1 immunoreactivity is a poor prognostic marker, even in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma without apparent NF1 genomic alterations, but the underlying molecular mechanism requires further investigation.",

However, the precise function of tetraspanin 6 (TSPAN6) in glioma remains unclear. Integrated raw data from the Tumor Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Profiling (GEO) databases were processed using R4.2.1. Bioinformatic methods were used to analyze the gene expression levels of TSPAN6 in both glioma and normal brain tissues, correlating them with clinical characteristics. Additionally, the predictive value of TSPAN6 in relation to the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy response was assessed. In vitro experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of TSPAN6 knockdown on glioma cell proliferation, migration, cell cycle regulation, and macrophage recruitment. TSPAN6 expression was significantly upregulated in glioma tissues compared to normal tissues. Elevated TSPAN6 expression is strongly correlated with unfavorable clinical characteristics in gliomas. Bioinformatic analyses revealed a significant correlation between elevated TSPAN6 expression and reduced overall survival. Additionally, TSPAN6 was co-expressed with several immune checkpoint genes and revealed a prognostic value in the context of ICB therapy. Functional enrichment analysis revealed the involvement of TSPAN6 in cell-cycle regulation. Furthermore, TSPAN6 expression positively correlated with macrophage and neutrophil infiltration. In vitro experiments confirmed that the downregulation of TSPAN6 inhibited U251 cell proliferation, disrupted the cell cycle, diminished migratory capabilities, and reduced the recruitment of macrophages. Our findings emphasize its potential as both a diagnostic and therapeutic target as well as a predictor of immune therapy response in gliomas.",

          "abstract": "Ubiquitination is one of the most prevalent and complex post-translational modifications of proteins in eukaryotes, playing a critical role in regulating various physiological and pathological processes. Targeting ubiquitination pathways, either through inhibition or activation, holds promise as a novel therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. However, the expression patterns, prognostic significance, and underlying mechanisms of ubiquitination-related genes (URGs) in sarcoma (SARC) remain unclear. We analyzed URG expression patterns and prognostic implications in TCGA-SARC using public databases, identifying DEGs related to ubiquitination among SARC molecular subtypes. Functional enrichment analysis elucidated their biological significance. Prognostic signatures were developed using LASSO-Cox regression, and a predictive nomogram was constructed. External validation was performed using GEO datasets and clinical tissue samples. The association between URG risk scores and various clinical parameters, immune response, drug sensitivity, and RNA modification regulators was investigated. Integration of data from multiple sources and RT-qPCR confirmed upregulated expression of prognostic URGs in SARC. Single-cell RNA sequencing data analyzed URG distribution across immune cell types. Prediction analysis identified potential target genes of microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs. We identified five valuable genes (CALR, CASP3, BCL10, PSMD7, PSMD10) and constructed a prognostic model, simultaneously identifying two URG-related subtypes in SARC. The UEGs between subtypes in SARC are mainly enriched in pathways such as Cell cycle, focal adhesion, and ECM-receptor interaction. Analysis of URG risk scores reveals that patients with a low-risk score have better prognoses compared to those with high-risk scores. There is a significant correlation between DRG riskscore and clinical features, immune therapy response, drug sensitivity, and genes related to pan-RNA epigenetic modifications. High-risk SARC patients were identified as potential beneficiaries of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. We established regulatory axes in SARC, including CALR/hsa-miR-29c-3p/LINC00943, CASP3/hsa-miR-143-3p/LINC00944, and MIR503HG. RT-qPCR data further confirmed the upregulation of prognostic URGs in SARC. Finally, we validated the prognostic model's excellent predictive performance in predicting outcomes for SARC patients. We discovered a significant correlation between aberrant expression of URGs and prognosis in SARC patients, identifying a prognostic model related to ubiquitination. This model provides a basis for individualized treatment and immunotherapy decisions for SARC patients.",

          "abstract": "Rabex-5 (also called RabGEF1), a protein originally characterized for its Rab5 GEF function, also has an A20-like E3 ubiquitin ligase domain. We and others reported that Rabex-5 E3 activity promotes Ras mono- and di-ubiquitination to inhibit Ras signaling in Drosophila and mammals. Subsequently, we reported that Rabex-5 inhibits Notch signaling in the Drosophila hematopoietic system. Here we report genetic interactions using Rabex-5 transgenes encoding domain-specific mutations that show that Rabex-5 requires an intact E3 domain to inhibit Notch signaling in the epithelial tissue of the developing wing. Surprisingly, we discovered that Rabex-5 with an impaired E3 domain but active Rab5 GEF domain suppresses Notch loss-of-function phenotypes and enhances both Notch duplication phenotypes and activated Ras phenotypes consistent with a model that the Rab5 GEF activity of Rabex-5 might positively regulate Ras and Notch. Positive and negative regulation of developmental signaling by its different catalytic domains could allow Rabex-5 to precisely coordinate developmental signaling to fine-tune patterning. Finally, we report that Rabex-5 also inhibits the overgrowth due to loss of PTEN or activation of PI3K but not activation of AKT. Inhibition of Ras, Notch, and PI3K signaling may explain why Rabex-5 is deleted in some cancers. Paradoxically, Rabex-5 is reported to be an oncogene in other cancers. We propose that Rabex-5 acts as a tumor suppressor via its E3 activity to inhibit Ras, Notch, and PI3K signaling and as an oncogene via its Rab5 GEF activity to enhance Ras and Notch signaling.",

Our prior studies highlight the importance of glutamate as a key regulator of ILC tumor growth and therapeutic response. Here we examine the expression of four key proteins involved in glutamate transport and metabolism - SLC3A2, SLC7A11, GPX4, and GLUD1/2 - in a racially diverse cohort of 72 estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) ILC and 50 ER+ invasive ductal carcinoma, no special type (IDC/NST) patients with primary disease. All four proteins are associated with increased tumor size in ILC, but not IDC/NST, with SLC3A2 also specifically linked to shorter overall survival and the presence of comorbidities in ILC. Notably, GLUD1/2 expression is associated with ER expression in ILC, and is most strongly associated with increased tumor size and stage in Black women with ILC from our cohort and TCGA. We further explore the effects of GLUD1 inhibition in endocrine therapy-resistant ILC cells using the small-molecule inhibitor R162, which reduces ER protein levels, increases reactive oxygen species, and inhibits oxidative phosphorylation. These findings highlight a potentially important role for glutamate metabolism in ILC, particularly for Black women, and position several of these glutamate-handling proteins as potential targets for therapeutic intervention in ILC.",

Furthermore, the deregulation of <i>PRKACA</i> expression in GC and CRC was investigated using correlative and regression analyses. The results showed that <i>PRKACA</i> expression subsets were enriched for gene targets of chemotherapeutics, tyrosine kinase, and \u03b2-adrenergic inhibitors. Moreover, high <i>PRKACA</i> expression was associated with adverse clinicopathological and genomic features of GC and CRC. Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis also showed that <i>PRKACA</i>-high subsets of the GI cancers were enriched for the biological and molecular functions that are associated with cell motility, invasion, and metastasis but not cell proliferation. Finally, multiple regression analyses identified multiple methylation loci, transcription factors, miRNA species, and <i>PRKACA</i> copy number changes that deregulated <i>PRKACA</i> expression in GC and CRC.

Currently, patients are treated based on TNM staging, without molecular tumor characterization. This study aimed to validate a technique that combines the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) with high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) for detecting mutations in codon 12 of KRAS in tumor and plasma, and to assess its prognostic value. Prospective study including patients with newly diagnosed PDAC with tumor and plasma samples collected before treatment. Mutations in codon 12 of KRAS (G12D, G12V, G12C, and G12R) were detected using ARMS-HRMA and compared to Sanger sequencing (SS). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of these mutations. A total of 88 patients, 93% with ECOG-PS 0-1, 57% with resectable disease. ARMS-HRMA technique showed a higher sensitivity than SS, both in tumor and plasma (77% vs. 51%; 25 vs. 0%, respectively). The most frequent mutation was G12D (n = 32, 36%), followed by G12V (n = 22, 25%). On multivariate analysis, patients with G12D and/or G12C mutations, either in tumor or plasma, had lower PFS (HR 1.792, 95% CI 1.061-3.028, <i>p</i> = 0.029; HR 2.081, 95% CI 1.014-4.272, <i>p</i> = 0.046, respectively) and lower OS (HR 1.757, 95% CI 1.013-3.049, <i>p</i> = 0.045; HR 2.229, 95% CI 1.082-4.594, <i>p</i> = 0.030, respectively). ARMS-HRMA is a rapid and cost-effective method for detecting <i>KRAS</i> mutations in PDAC patients, offering the potential for stratifying prognosis and guiding treatment decisions. The presence of G12D and G12C mutations in both tumor and plasma is associated with a poorer prognosis.",

With recent breakthroughs in molecular technologies have come novel SCC treatment paradigms, including immunotherapies and targeted therapy. This review compares commonalities and differences across SCCs from different anatomical sites, including risk factors and genetics, as well as cellular and molecular programs driving tumorigenesis. We review landmark discoveries of the \"cancer stem cells\" (CSCs) that initiate and propagate SCCs and their gene and translational regulation programs. This has led to an appreciation that interactions between CSCs and the immune system play key roles in invasion and therapeutic resistance.

Prognostic biomarkers may help in better delineating the aggressiveness of this disease in individual patients and help to tailor appropriate therapies. CDX2, a transcription factor of gastrointestinal differentiation, has been proposed as a biomarker for good outcomes and could also be a marker of specific sub-types amenable to targeted therapies. Colorectal cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) colorectal cohort and colon cancers from the Sidra-LUMC AC-ICAM cohort were categorized according to their expressions of CDX2 mRNA. Groups with CDX2 suppression were compared with cancers showing no suppression regarding their clinical and genomic characteristics. CDX2-suppressed colorectal cancers showed a high prevalence of Microsatellite Instability (MSI) and a lower prevalence of chromosomal Instability (CIN) compared to non-CDX2-suppressed cancers. In addition, CDX2-suppressed cancers had a higher prevalence of mutations in several receptor tyrosine kinase genes, including <i>EGFR</i>, <i>ERBB3</i>, <i>ERBB4</i>, <i>RET</i>, and <i>ROS1</i>. In contrast, CDX2-suppressed cancers displayed lower mutation frequencies than non-CDX2-suppressed cancers in the genes encoding for the two most frequently mutated tumor suppressors, <i>APC</i> and <i>TP53</i>, and the most frequently mutated colorectal cancer oncogene, <i>KRAS</i>. However, CDX2-suppressed colorectal cancers had a higher prevalence of mutations in alternative genes of the WNT/APC/\u03b2-catenin and KRAS/BRAF/MEK pathways. In addition, they showed frequent mutations in DNA damage response (DDR) genes, such as <i>BRCA2</i> and <i>ATM</i>. CDX2-suppressed colorectal cancers constitute a genomically distinct subset of colon and rectal cancers that have a lower prevalence of <i>KRAS</i>, <i>APC</i>, and <i>TP53</i> mutations, but a high prevalence of mutations in less commonly mutated colorectal cancer genes. These alterations could serve as targets for personalized therapeutics in this subset.",

Here, and by using an unbiassed screen, we discovered that the DUB USP10 stabilizes \u03b2-Catenin specifically in APC-truncated CRC in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies, including in vitro binding together with computational modelling, revealed that USP10 binding to \u03b2-Catenin is mediated via the unstructured N-terminus of USP10 and is outcompeted by intact APC, favouring \u03b2-catenin degradation. However, in APC-truncated cancer cells USP10 binds to \u03b2-catenin, increasing its stability which is critical for maintaining an undifferentiated tumour identity. Elimination of USP10 reduces the expression of WNT and stem cell signatures and induces the expression of differentiation genes. Remarkably, silencing of USP10 in murine and patient-derived CRC organoids established that it is essential for NOTUM signalling and the APC super competitor-phenotype, reducing tumorigenic properties of APC-truncated CRC. These findings are clinically relevant as patient-derived organoids are highly dependent on USP10, and abundance of USP10 correlates with poorer prognosis of CRC patients. Our findings reveal, therefore, a role for USP10 in CRC cell identity, stemness, and tumorigenic growth by stabilising \u03b2-Catenin, leading to aberrant WNT signalling and degradation resistant tumours. Thus, USP10 emerges as a unique therapeutic target in APC truncated CRC.",

While mutations of SWI/SNF genes are relatively uncommon in prostate cancer (PCa), the literature suggests that deregulation of various subunits plays a role in prostate tumorigenesis. To assess SWI/SNF functions in a clinical context, we studied the mutually exclusive, paralogue accessory subunits SMARCD1, SMARCD2, and SMARCD3 that are included in every known complex and are sought to confer specificity. Performing immunohistochemistry (IHC), the protein levels of the SMARCD family members were measured using a tissue microarray (TMA) comprising malignant samples and matching healthy tissue of non-metastatic PCa patients (n\u2009=\u2009168). Moreover, IHC was performed in castration-resistant tumors (n\u2009=\u20099) and lymph node metastases (n\u2009=\u200922). To assess their potential role as molecular biomarkers, SMARCD1 and SMARCD3 protein levels were correlated with clinical parameters such as T stage, Gleason score, biochemical recurrence, and progression-free survival. SMARCD1 protein levels in non-metastatic primary tumors, lymph node metastases, and castration-resistant samples were significantly higher than in benign tissues. Likewise, SMARCD3 protein expression was elevated in tumor tissue and especially lymph node metastases compared to benign samples. While SMARCD1 levels in primary tumors did not exhibit significant associations with any of the tested clinical parameters, SMARCD3 exhibited an inverse correlation with pre-operative PSA levels. Moreover, low SMARCD3 expression was associated with progression to metastasis. In congruence with previous literature, our results implicate that both SMARCD1 and SMARCD3 may exhibit relevant functions in the context of prostate tumorigenesis. Moreover, our approach suggests a potential role of SMARCD3 as a novel prognostic marker in clinically non-metastatic PCa.",

In vitro, silencing of CLDN11 enhanced the proliferative and migratory characteristics of breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231.

Globally, integrins represent a frequently altered and misexpressed pathway, with alteration and dysregulation overall being protumorigenic. Expression dysregulation, better than mutational landscape, of integrin family successfully identifies a subgroup of aggressive tumors with a high level of proliferation and stemness. The results reveal that several molecular mechanisms collectively regulate integrin expression in a context-dependent manner. For potential clinical usage, we constructed a weighted scoring system, integrinScore, to measure integrin signaling patterns in individual tumors. Remarkably, integrinScore was consistently correlated with predefined molecular subtypes in multiple cancers, with integrinScore-high tumors being more aggressive. Importantly, integrinScore was cancer-dependent and closely associated with proliferation, stemness, tumor microenvironment, metastasis, and immune signatures. IntegrinScore also predicted patients' response to immunotherapy. By mining drug databases, we unraveled an array of compounds that may modulate integrin signaling. Finally, we built a user-friendly database, Pan-cancer Integrin Explorer (PIExplorer; http://computationalbiology.cn/PIExplorer), to facilitate researchers to explore integrin-related knowledge. Collectively, we provide a comprehensive characterization of integrins across cancers and offer gene-specific and cancer-specific rationales for developing integrin-targeted therapy.",

          "abstract": "Budding uninhibited by benzimidazole 1 (BUB1) is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase, showing prominent importance for proper function during mitosis. However, little is known about <i>BUB1</i> mRNA expression in breast cancer (BRCA) and its correlation with prognosis and immune infiltration. Hence, we aimed to unveil its potential as groundbreaking biomarkers for immunotherapy efficacy and the prognosis of BRCA. Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) is a potent tool for identifying significant clusters of genes and pathways in the resulting dataset. In this study, gene set enrichment analysis of BUB1 was conducted using DAVID. The clinical characteristics of patients with or without altered <i>BUB1</i> mRNA expression were compared using cBioPortal. Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) is a known as database for comprehensive analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in various cancers. In the present study, the relationship between BUB1 expression and the abundance of immune infiltrates was explored using TIMER in BRCA. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed to analyze the protein expression of BUB1 in tumor tissue specimens. We used PrognoScan and Kaplan-Meier Plotter to evaluate the prognosis of patients with different BUB1 expression levels. The expression of BUB1 in various tumor tissues was higher than that in adjacent normal tissues. BUB1 was mainly localized to the nucleoplasm and additionally localized to the cytosol. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that the cell cycle was the most significant pathway. Abnormal <i>BUB1</i> mRNA expression was more frequently detected in invasive ductal carcinoma with higher histological grades and BRCAs with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, and basal-like phenotypes. The BUB1 expression was correlated positively with tumor purity, B cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, while BUB1 had no significant correlation with macrophages. The results of immunohistochemical staining from clinical samples further confirmed that BUB1 was overexpressed in BRCA compared to benign tumor (fibroadenoma of breast) (P<0.01). BRCA patients with lower BUB1 expression had a better prognosis than those with higher BUB1 expression in overall survival (OS) curves, distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) curves, and relapse-free survival (RFS) curves (P<0.05). Our results suggest that BUB1 is a potential molecular biomarker for evaluating the prognosis and predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy for BRCA.",

However, TMB is not always a reliable predictor and displays heterogeneity. Non-B DNA, susceptible to mutations, play a significant role in cancer development, indicating their potential merit when combined with mutation for enhanced markers in cancer. We assessed mutations and non-B DNA interplay as biomarkers. Our methodology quantifies tumour mutations and their co-localization with non-B DNA, using survival and drug sensitivity assessments for clinical relevance. We introduce two novel markers, 'nbTMB' (non-B-informed tumour mutation burden) and 'mlTNB' (mutation-localised tumour non-B burden). In case studies: (1) nbTMB informs on survival heterogeneity among TMB-high patients undergoing immunotherapy whereas TMB is unable to further differentiate; (2) nbTMB informs on altered cisplatin sensitivity among ovarian cancer cell lines whereas TMB is unable to differentiate; and (3) mlTNB informs on survival heterogeneity among early-stage pancreatic cancer progressors in whom other markers of genomic instability fail to differentiate. These novel markers offer a nuanced approach to enhance our understanding of treatment responses and outcomes in cancer, underscoring the need for a comprehensive exploration of the interplay between non-B and B-DNA features.",

          "abstract": "With significant advancements in the study of DNA Damage Response (DDR) and Fanconi Anemia (FA) signaling, we previously introduced the term \"FA signaling\" to encompass \"all signaling transductions involving one or more FA proteins.\" This network has now evolved into the largest cellular defense network, integrating over 30 key players, including ATM, ATR, BLM, HRR6, RAD18, FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, BRCA2, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCI, BRIP1, FANCL, FANCM, PALB2, RAD51C, SLX4, ERCC4, RAD51, BRCA1, UBE2T, XRCC2, MAD2L2, RFWD3, FAAP20, FAAP24, FAAP100, and CENPX. This system responds to both endogenous and exogenous cellular insults. However, the mutational signatures associated with this defense mechanism in non-FA human cancers have not been extensively explored. In this study, we report that different types of human cancers are characterized by distinct somatically mutated genes related to DDR/FA signaling, each accompanied by a unique spectrum of potential driver mutations. For example, in pan-cancer samples, ATM emerges as the most frequently mutated gene (5%) among the 31 genes analyzed, with the highest number of potential driver mutations (1714), followed by BRCA2 (4% with 970 putative driver mutations). However, this pattern is not universal across specific cancer types. For example, FANCT is the most frequently mutated gene in breast (14%) and liver (4%) cancers. In addition, the alteration frequency of DDR/FA signaling due to these mutations exceeds 70% in a subtype of prostate cancer, with each subtype of brain, breast, lung, and prostate cancers displaying distinct patterns of gene alteration frequency. Furthermore, these gene alteration patterns significantly impact patient survival and disease-free periods. Collectively, our findings not only enhance our understanding of cancer development and progression but also have significant implications for cancer patient care and prognosis, particularly in the development of effective therapeutic strategies.",

However, the prevalence of <i>HER2</i> alterations in Malaysian NSCLC patients remains unreported. This study examined the prevalence and characteristics of <i>HER2</i> mutations and amplification in a Malaysian cohort. Additionally, a systematic review was conducted to evaluate the global prevalence of <i>HER2</i> alterations in NSCLC, as well as the efficacy of HER2-targeted therapies observed in clinical trials. NSCLC tumour samples received from October 2019 to December 2022 for next-generation sequencing diagnostics were included in the retrospective analysis. In this patient cohort, <i>HER2</i> alteration was present in 5.8% of patients; 3.9% had <i>HER2</i> mutations, 1.5% had <i>HER2</i> amplifications and 0.4% were both <i>HER2</i>-mutated and amplified. <i>HER2</i> exon 20 insertions were the most common <i>HER2</i> variants, detected in 47/59 (79.7%) of <i>HER2</i>-mutated patients. Among cases with <i>HER2</i> exon 20 insertions, the Y772_A775dup variant was found in 34 patient samples. <i>HER2</i>-mutated patients were significantly younger than non-<i>HER2</i>-mutants (61 versus 64 years old; <i>p</i> = 0.046) and were inclined to be female and never-smokers, albeit not statistically significant. Patients with <i>HER2</i> amplification were more likely to have progressed post-tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (<i>p</i> = 0.015). The systematic review highlighted a global variation in the prevalence of <i>HER2</i> alterations in NSCLC, ranging from 0.3% to 9.1% for mutations and 0.2% to 19% for amplification. Finally, phase II clinical trials involving <i>HER2-</i>altered NSCLC patients demonstrated promising treatment outcomes with trastuzumab deruxtecan, trastuzumab emtansine, pyrotinib, pyrotinib + apatinib and trastuzumab + pertuzumab + docetaxel. In conclusion, the prevalence of <i>HER2</i> alteration among Malaysian NSCLC patients falls within the global range.

          "abstract": "As a leading prevalent malignancy, breast cancer remains a significant worldwide health issue. Recent research indicates that neutrophils play a crucial role in breast cancer development. The prognostic significance of neutrophil-related genes (NRGs) or the immune landscape of the neutrophil-related signature in invasive breast cancer (IBC) is, nevertheless, unknown. To uncover innovative therapy alternatives, the significance of the neutrophil-related signatures in IBC was evaluated here. Briefly, a prediction model based on neutrophil-related core prognostic genes and The Cancer Genome Atlas data was created (TCGA). The model may assess IBC patients' prognosis. The IBC data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) confirmed the prognostic accuracy of the model. The overall survival (OS) of patients was worse in the group with a high NRGs score compared to the group with a low NRGs score. In addition, patients with low NRGs scores were considerably more sensitive to vinorelbine, cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, docetaxel, and cisplatin. Patients with low NRGs scores responded better to CTLA-4 and PD-1 treatments. Additionally, the immune microenvironment components were more abundant in patients with low NRGs scores. Moreover, qRT-PCR results confirmed that LEF1 had a higher expression level in tumor samples compared to normal samples, whereas NRG1 and STX11 exhibited lower expression levels in tumor samples than in normal samples. These results suggest that NRGs might be utilized as biomarkers to predict the prognosis of individuals with IBC, thereby paving the way for the creation of customized therapies for IBC.",

Although there have been recent advancements in prognostic tissue biomarkers, limitations still exist. We leveraged matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded prostate cancer specimens to determine if N-linked glycans expressed in the extracellular matrix of lethal neuroendocrine prostate cancer were also expressed in conventional prostate adenocarcinomas that were associated with poor outcomes. We found that N-glycan fucosylation was abundant in neuroendocrine prostate cancer as well as adenocarcinomas at the time of prostatectomy that eventually developed recurrent metastatic disease. Analysis of patient-derived xenografts revealed that this fucosylation signature was enriched differently across metastatic disease organ sites, with the highest abundance in liver metastases. These data suggest that N-linked fucosylated glycans could be an early tissue biomarker for poor prostate cancer outcomes. Implications: These studies identify that hyper-fucosylated N-linked glycans are enriched in neuroendocrine prostate cancer and conventional prostate adenocarcinomas that progress to metastatic disease, thus advancing biomarker discovery and providing insights into mechanisms underlying metastatic disease.",

Despite its prevalence, molecular pathways, such as the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway, have not been extensively studied in the context of EC. This study aims to explore the clinical implications of SHH expression in EC, potentially uncovering new insights into the disease's pathogenesis and offering valuable insights for therapeutic strategies in EC. We utilized data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to divide the dataset into '<i>High SHH</i>' and '<i>Low SHH</i>' groups based on a gene signature score derived from SHH pathway-related genes. We explored the clinical and tumor characteristics of these groups, focusing on key cancer hallmarks, including stemness, proliferation, cytolytic activity, tumor micro-environment, and genomic instability. '<i>High SHH</i>' tumors emerged as a distinct category with favorable clinical and molecular features. These tumors exhibited lower proliferation rates, reduced angiogenesis, and diminished genomic instability, indicating a controlled and less aggressive tumor growth pattern. Moreover, '<i>High SHH</i>' tumors displayed lower stemness, highlighting a less invasive phenotype. The immune micro-environment in '<i>High SHH</i>' tumors was enriched with immune cell types, such as macrophage M0, monocytes, B cells, CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, follicular helper T cells, and natural killer cells. This immune enrichment, coupled with higher cytolytic activity, suggested an improved anti-tumor immune response. Our study sheds light on the clinical significance of Sonic signaling in EC. '<i>High SHH</i>' tumors exhibit a unique molecular and clinical profile associated with favorable cancer hallmarks, lower grades, and better survival. These findings underscore the potential utility of SHH expression as a robust prognostic biomarker, offering valuable insights for tailored therapeutic strategies in EC. Understanding the SHH pathway's role in EC contributes to our growing knowledge of this cancer and may pave the way for more effective treatment strategies in the future.",

Beyond metabolic roles, ALDHs participate in essential biological processes, including differentiation, embryogenesis and the DNA damage response, while also serving as markers for cancer stem cells (CSCs). Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1B1 (ALDH1B1) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the detoxification of lipid peroxidation by-products and metabolism of various aldehyde substrates. This study examines the potential role of ALDH1B1 in human lung adenocarcinoma and its association with the CSC phenotype. To this end, we utilized the lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, engineered to stably express the human ALDH1B1 protein tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Overexpression of ALDH1B1 led to notable changes in cell morphology, proliferation rate and clonogenic efficiency. Furthermore, ALDH1B1-overexpressing A549 cells exhibited enhanced resistance to the chemotherapeutic agents etoposide and cisplatin. Additionally, ALDH1B1 overexpression correlated with increased migratory potential and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), mediated by the upregulation of transcription factors such as <i>SNAI2</i>, <i>ZEB2</i> and <i>TWIST1</i>, alongside the downregulation of <i>E-cadherin</i>. Moreover, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis using data from 507 publicly available lung adenocarcinoma clinical samples revealed a significant correlation between <i>ALDH1B1</i> and various molecules implicated in CSC-related signaling pathways, including Wnt, Notch, hypoxia, Hedgehog, retinoic acid, Hippo, NF-\u03ba\u0392, TGF-\u03b2, PI3K/PTEN-AKT and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. These findings provide insights into the role of ALDH1B1 in lung tumor progression and its relation to the lung CSC phenotype, thereby offering potential therapeutic targets in the clinical management of lung adenocarcinoma.",

          "abstract": "Allergic diseases are systemic chronic inflammatory diseases associated with multiorgan damage and complex pathogenesis. Several studies have revealed the association of gene expression abnormalities with the development of allergic diseases, but the biomedical field still lacks a public platform for comprehensive analysis and visualization of transcriptomic data of allergic diseases. The aim of the study is to provide a comprehensive web tool for multiple analysis in allergic diseases. We retrieved and downloaded human and mouse gene expression profile data associated with allergic diseases from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and standardized the data uniformly. We used gene sets obtained from the MSigDB database for pathway enrichment analysis and multiple immune infiltration algorithms for the estimation of immune cell proportion. The basic construction of the web pages was based on the Shiny framework. Additionally, more convenient features were added to the server to improve the efficiency of the web pages, such as jQuery plugins and a comment box to collect user feedback. We developed CTPAD, an interactive R Shiny application that integrates public databases and multiple algorithms to explore allergic disease-related datasets and implement rich transcriptomic visualization capabilities, including gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis, immune infiltration analysis, correlation analysis, and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. All functional modules offer customization options and can be downloaded in PDF format with high-resolution images. CTPAD largely facilitates the work of researchers without bioinformatics background to enable them to better explore the transcriptomic features associated with allergic diseases. CTPAD is available at https://smuonco.shinyapps.io/CTPAD/ .",

Two or more activating mutations (multi-hit) for the PIK3CA allele increase PI3K\u237a signaling compared to single-point mutations, resulting in exceptional response to PI3K\u237a inhibition. We aimed to identify the prevalence of PIK3CA multi-hit mutations in metastatic CRC to identify patients who may benefit from PI3K inhibitors. The Foundation Medicine database (Boston, MA, USA) was analyzed for patients with CRC who underwent genomic profiling on tumor DNA isolated during routine clinical care from 2013 to 2021. Molecular and clinical variables were abstracted for patients with PIK3CA mutations. We identified 49 051 patients with CRC who underwent Foundation Medicine testing. 710/41154 (1.7%) patients had multi-hit PIK3CA mutations, of which 53% were male (n\u2005=\u2005448) with a median age of 60. Microsatellite status was available for 697 patients with multi-hit PIK3CA and 17.6% (123/697) were microsatellite instability-high. Clinically relevant mutations in KRAS and BRAFV600E were seen in 459/710 (64.7%) and 65/710 (9.1%), respectively. The 4 most common PIK3CA variants were H1047R (9.8%), E545K (9.2%), E542K (9.0%), and R88Q (7.1%). The most common variant pair was E542K-E545K (4.7%). Multi-hit mutations in PIK3CA are seen in 1.7% of advanced CRC, a meaningful prevalence given the high burden of CRC worldwide, and may represent a subset of patients that have enhanced sensitivity to PI3K inhibition. Future investigation regarding the clinical utility of PI3K inhibitors is warranted in multi-hit PIK3CA CRC.",

Despite advancements in BC treatment driven by extensive characterization of its molecular hallmarks, challenges such as drug resistance, tumor relapse, and metastasis persist. Therefore, there is an urgent need for alternative treatment approaches with multi-modal efficacy to overcome these hurdles. In this context, natural bioactives are increasingly recognized for their pivotal role as anti-cancer compounds. This study focuses on predicting molecular targets for key herbal phytoconstituents-gallic acid, piperine, quercetin, resveratrol, and beta-sitosterol-present in the polyherbal formulation, Krishnadi Churna. Using an in-silico network pharmacology model, key genes were identified and docked against these marker compounds and controls. Mammary carcinoma emerged as the most significant phenotype of the putative targets. Analysis of an online database revealed that out of 135 predicted targets, 134 were mutated in breast cancer patients. Notably, ESR1, CYP19A1, and EGFR were identified as key genes which are known to regulate the BC progression. Docking studies demonstrated that the herbal phytoconstituents had similar or better docking scores than positive controls for these key genes, with convincing protein-ligand interactions confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations, MM/GBSA and free energy landscape (FEL) analysis. Overall, this study highlights the predictive potential of herbal phytoconstituents in targeting BC genes, suggesting their promise as a basis for developing new therapeutic formulations for BC.",

          "abstract": "Cutaneous leiomyosarcoma (cLMS) is a rare soft-tissue neoplasm, showing smooth muscle differentiation, that arises from the mesenchymal cells of the dermis. To date, genetic investigation of these tumours has involved studies with small sample sizes and limited analyses that identified recurrent somatic mutations in RB1 and TP53, copy number gain of MYOCD and IGF1R, and copy number loss of PTEN. To better understand the molecular pathogenesis of cLMS, we comprehensively explored the mutational landscape of these rare tumours to identify candidate driver events. In this retrospective, multi-institutional study, we performed whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing in 38 cases of cLMS. TP53 and RB1 were identified as significantly mutated and thus represent validated driver genes of cLMS. COSMIC mutational signatures SBS7a/b and DBS1 were recurrent; thus, ultraviolet light exposure may be an aetiological factor driving cLMS. Analysis of significantly recurrent somatic copy number alterations, which represent candidate driver events, found focal (< 10 Mb) deletions encompassing TP53 and KDM6B, and amplifications encompassing ZMYM2, MYOCD, MAP2K4 and NCOR1. A larger (24 Mb) recurrent deletion encompassing CYLD was also identified as significant. Significantly recurrent broad copy number alterations, involving at least half of a chromosome arm, included deletions of 6p/q, 10p/q, 11q, 12q, 13q and 16p/q, and amplification of 15q. Notably PTEN is located on 10q, RB1 on 13q and IGFR1 on 15q. Fusion gene analysis identified recurrent CRTC1/CRTC3::MAML2 fusions, as well as many novel fusions in individual samples. Our analysis of the largest number of cases of cLMS to date highlights the importance of large cohort sizes and exploration beyond small targeted gene panels when performing molecular analyses, as it allowed a comprehensive exploration of the mutational landscape of these tumours and identification of novel candidate driver events. It also uniquely afforded the opportunity to compare the molecular phenotype of cLMS with LMS of other tissue types, such as uterine and soft-tissue LMS. Given that molecular profiling has resulted in the development of novel targeted treatment approaches for uterine and soft-tissue LMS, our study now allows the same opportunities to become available for patients with cLMS.",

          "abstract": "Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is incurable and fatal, making prostate cancer the second leading cancer-related cause of death for American men. CRPC results from therapeutic resistance to standard-of-care androgen deprivation (AD) treatments, through incompletely understood molecular mechanisms, and lacks durable therapeutic options. In this study, we identified enhanced soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) signaling as a mechanism that restrains CRPC initiation and growth. Patients with aggressive, fatal CRPC exhibited significantly lower serum levels of the sGC catalytic product cyclic GMP (cGMP) compared with the castration-sensitive stage. In emergent castration-resistant cells isolated from castration-sensitive prostate cancer populations, the obligate sGC heterodimer was repressed via methylation of its \u03b2 subunit. Genetically abrogating sGC complex formation in castration-sensitive prostate cancer cells promoted evasion of AD-induced senescence and concomitant castration-resistant tumor growth. In established castration-resistant cells, the sGC complex was present but in a reversibly oxidized and inactive state. Subjecting CRPC cells to AD regenerated the functional complex, and cotreatment with riociguat, an FDA-approved sGC agonist, evoked redox stress-induced apoptosis. Riociguat decreased castration-resistant tumor growth and increased apoptotic markers, with elevated cGMP levels correlating significantly with lower tumor burden. Riociguat treatment reorganized the tumor vasculature and eliminated hypoxic tumor niches, decreasing CD44+ tumor progenitor cells and increasing the radiosensitivity of castration-resistant tumors. Thus, this study showed that enhancing sGC activity can inhibit CRPC emergence and progression through tumor cell-intrinsic and extrinsic effects. Riociguat can be repurposed to overcome CRPC, with noninvasive monitoring of cGMP levels as a marker for on-target efficacy. Significance: Soluble guanylyl cyclase signaling inhibits castration-resistant prostate cancer emergence and can be stimulated with FDA-approved riociguat to resensitize resistant tumors to androgen deprivation, providing a strategy to prevent and treat castration resistance.",

However, there are currently no validated biomarkers to identify which patients will\u00a0benefit from dual ICB<sup>1,2</sup>. Here we show that patients with NSCLC who have mutations in the STK11 and/or KEAP1 tumour suppressor genes derived clinical benefit from dual ICB with the PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab and the CTLA4 inhibitor tremelimumab, but not from durvalumab alone, when added to chemotherapy in the randomized phase III POSEIDON trial<sup>3</sup>. Unbiased genetic screens identified loss of both of these tumour suppressor genes as independent drivers of resistance to PD-(L)1 inhibition, and showed that loss of Keap1 was the strongest genomic predictor of dual ICB efficacy-a finding that was confirmed in several mouse models of Kras-driven NSCLC. In both mouse models and patients, KEAP1 and STK11 alterations were associated with an adverse tumour microenvironment, which was characterized by a preponderance of suppressive myeloid cells and the depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells, but relative sparing of CD4<sup>+</sup> effector subsets. Dual ICB potently engaged CD4<sup>+</sup> effector cells and reprogrammed the tumour myeloid cell compartment towards inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-expressing tumoricidal phenotypes that-together with CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells-contributed to anti-tumour efficacy. These data support the use of chemo-immunotherapy with dual ICB to mitigate resistance to PD-(L)1 inhibition in patients with NSCLC who have STK11 and/or KEAP1 alterations.",

Despite its clinical significance, HRD testing is highly complex. Here, we investigated in a proof-of-concept study whether Deep Learning (DL) can predict HRD status solely based on routine hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) histology images across nine different cancer types. We developed a deep learning pipeline with attention-weighted multiple instance learning (attMIL) to predict HRD status from histology images. As part of our approach, we calculated a genomic scar HRD score by combining loss of heterozygosity (LOH), telomeric allelic imbalance (TAI), and large-scale state transitions (LST) from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data of n\u2009=\u20095209 patients across two independent cohorts. The model's effectiveness was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), focusing on its accuracy in predicting genomic HRD against a clinically recognized cutoff value. Our study demonstrated the predictability of genomic HRD status in endometrial, pancreatic, and lung cancers reaching cross-validated AUROCs of 0.79, 0.58, and 0.66, respectively. These predictions generalized well to an external cohort, with AUROCs of 0.93, 0.81, and 0.73. Moreover, a breast cancer-trained image-based HRD classifier yielded an AUROC of 0.78 in the internal validation cohort and was able to predict HRD in endometrial, prostate, and pancreatic cancer with AUROCs of 0.87, 0.84, and 0.67, indicating that a shared HRD-like phenotype occurs across these tumor entities. This study establishes that HRD can be directly predicted from H&E slides using attMIL, demonstrating its applicability across nine different tumor types.",

While androgen deprivation therapy is initially effective in treating prostate cancer, most cases of advanced prostate cancer eventually progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is incurable. Similarly, the most aggressive form of prostatic carcinoma occurs in dogs that have been castrated. To identify molecular similarities between canine prostate cancer and human CRPC, we performed a comparative analysis of gene expression profiles. Through this transcriptomic analysis, we found that prostatic carcinoma in castrated dogs demonstrates an androgen-indifferent phenotype, characterised by low-androgen receptor and neuroendocrine-associated genes. Notably, we identified two genes, ISG15 and AZGP1, that were consistently up- and down-regulated, respectively, in both canine prostatic carcinoma and human CRPC. Additionally, we identified several other genes, including GPX3, S100P and IFITM1, that exhibited similar expression patterns in both species. Protein-protein interaction network analysis demonstrated that these five genes were part of a larger network of interferon-induced genes, suggesting that they may act together in signalling pathways that are disrupted in prostate cancer. Accordingly, our findings suggest that the interferon pathway may play a role in the development and progression of CRPC in both dogs and humans and chart a new therapeutic approach.",

IQGAP1 nucleates a myriad of pathways in a contextual manner and modulates many of the targets altered in GB like MAPK, NF-\u03baB, and mTOR/PI3K/Akt1, thus positioning it as a plausible common therapeutic target. Here, we review the targets that are subjects of GB treatment clinical trials and the commonly used animal models that facilitate target identification. We propose a model in which the dysfunction of various IQGAP1 pathways can explain to a larger extent some of the GB heterogeneity and offer a platform for personalized medicine.",

          "abstract": "Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The most prevalent histological subtype of lung cancer is lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), with incidence rising each year. Treating LUAD remains a significant issue due to a lack of early diagnosis and poor therapy outcomes. YKT6 is a member of the SNARE protein family, whose clinical value and biological function in LUAD has yet to be established. TCGA, HPA and UALCAN were used to analyze YKT6 mRNA and protein levels, the correlation between YKT6 expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis. YKT6 mRNA and protein expression were verified by qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and tissue microarrays (TMA). Additionally, lung cancer cell lines were chosen for YKT6 silencing to explore the effects on cell proliferation and migration. The cBioPortal was used to select YKT6-related genes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was created based on STRING database and hub genes were screened, with their expression levels and prognosis values in LUAD analyzed accordingly. YKT6-related genes were enriched by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analyses. In LUAD, YKT6 was distinctly highly expressed with relation to clinical features of staging, smoking, lymph node metastasis, and TP53 mutation. Elevated YKT6 expression was linked to adverse prognosis, serving as an independent unfavorable prognostic factor. Moreover, YKT6 presented high diagnostic value in LUAD patients (AUC\u2009=\u20090.856). Experimental validation indicated that freshly collected LUAD tissues showed significantly high mRNA expression of YKT6. IHC and TMA verified increased YKT6 protein level in LUAD. Knockdown of YKT6 inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis, with mitigated capability of migration and invasion. The top ten hub genes screened by PPI network were highly expressed in LUAD, and significantly associated with poor prognosis. GO and KEGG analyses showed that YKT6-related genes were mainly involved in cell cycle. Elevated YKT6 expression is related to poor prognosis of LUAD patients. YKT6 can serve as a novel biomarker for LUAD diagnosis and prognosis. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion was impaired with increased apoptosis upon YKT6 silencing in lung cancer cells. In summary, this study comprehensively uncovered that YKT6 could be identified as a potential prognostic and diagnostic biomarker in LUAD.",

We utilized a multi-database approach, analyzing cBioPortal for genetic alterations, RNA-Seq data from TCGA and GTEx for expression patterns, and RSEM for transcript analysis. Protein expression and interaction networks were assessed using the Human Protein Atlas, UniProt, and STRING. Prognostic value was determined through Cox regression analysis of TCGA clinical survival data, while immune cell infiltration across various cancers was examined using TCGA data and the TIMER2 platform. Our results revealed that BCAT2 alterations are primarily amplifications and is upregulated in various tumors, correlating with poor survival rates in several tumor types, including GBMLGG, LGG, and UVM. Elevated BCAT2 protein levels were common in pan-cancer, interacting with a range of metabolic enzymes. Additionally, BCAT2 expression significantly influenced CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and Treg cells infiltration, with varied correlations across cancer types. These findings indicate BCAT2 as a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and therapy, potentially regulating key metabolic and immune factors to mediate tumor progression and the microenvironment.",

          "abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that there is a considerable number of oncogenic mutations within the Ras superfamily of small GTPases which are the driving force behind a multitude of cancers. Ras proteins mediate a plethora of kinase pathways, including the MAPK, PI3K, and Ral pathways. Since Ras was considered undruggable until recently, pharmacological targeting of pathways downstream of Ras has been attempted to varying success, though drug resistance has often proven an issue. Nuances between kinase pathway activation in the presence of various Ras mutants are thought to contribute to the resistance, however, the reasoning behind activation of different pathways in different Ras mutational contexts is yet to be fully elucidated. Indeed, such disparities often depend on cancer type and disease progression. However, we are in a revolutionary age of Ras mutant targeted therapy, with direct-targeting KRAS-G12C inhibitors revolutionising the field and achieving FDA-approval in recent years. However, these are only beneficial in a subset of patients. Approximately 90% of Ras-mutant cancers are not KRAS-G12C mutant, and therefore raises the question as to whether other distinct amino acid substitutions within Ras may one day be targetable in a similar manner, and indeed whether better understanding of the downstream pathways these various mutants activate could further improve therapy. Here, we discuss the favouring of kinase pathways across an array of Ras-mutant oncogenic contexts and assess recent advances in pharmacological targeting of various Ras mutants. Ultimately, we will examine the utility of individualised pharmacological approaches to Ras-mediated cancer.",

We sought to identify translationally relevant differences between these 2 variants and compared with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. We characterized clinical and multiomic differences between UC (n\u2009=\u200932) and\u00a0UC-OGC (n\u2009=\u200915) using DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, and multiplex immunofluorescence and compared these findings with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Characteristics at diagnosis were similar between UC and UC-OGC, though the latter was more resectable (P\u2009=\u2009.009). Across all stages, median overall survival was shorter for UC than for UC-OGC (0.4\u00a0years vs 10.8\u2009years, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.003). This shorter survival was retained after stratification by resection, albeit without statistical significance (1.8\u00a0years vs 11.9\u2009years, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.08).

Findings were similar between UC and UC-OGC , except for decreased regulatory T cells in UC-OGC (P\u2009=\u2009.04). In this series, UC was more aggressive than UC-OGC, with these variants having more antigen-presenting cells and fewer regulatory T cells than pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, suggesting potential for immune-modulating therapies in the treatment of these pancreatic cancer subtypes.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the resistance mechanisms of tumor is crucial for advancing cancer therapies. The prospective MATCH-R trial (NCT02517892), led by Gustave Roussy, aimed to characterize resistance mechanisms to cancer treatments through molecular analysis of fresh tumor biopsies. This report presents the genomic data analysis of the MATCH-R study conducted from 2015 to 2022 and focuses on targeted therapies. The study included resistant metastatic patients (pts) who accepted an image-guided tumor biopsy. After evaluation of tumor content (TC) in frozen tissue biopsies, targeted NGS (10\u2009<\u2009TC\u2009<\u200930%) or Whole Exome Sequencing and RNA sequencing (TC\u2009>\u200930%) were performed before and/or after the anticancer therapy. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) were established by implanting tumor fragments into NOD scid gamma mice and amplified up to five passages. A total of 1,120 biopsies were collected from 857 pts with the most frequent tumor types being lung (38.8%), digestive (16.3%) and prostate (14.1%) cancer. Molecular targetable driver were identified in 30.9% (n\u2009=\u2009265/857) of the patients, with EGFR (41.5%), FGFR2/3 (15.5%), ALK (11.7%), BRAF (6.8%), and KRAS (5.7%) being the most common altered genes. Furthermore, 66.0% (n\u2009=\u2009175/265) had a biopsy at progression on targeted therapy. Among resistant cases, 41.1% (n\u2009=\u200972/175) had no identified molecular mechanism, 32.0% (n\u2009=\u200956/175) showed on-target resistance, and 25.1% (n\u2009=\u200944/175) exhibited a by-pass resistance mechanism. Molecular profiling of the 44 patients with by-pass resistance identified 51 variants, with KRAS (13.7%), PIK3CA (11.8%), PTEN (11.8%), NF2 (7.8%), AKT1 (5.9%), and NF1 (5.9%) being the most altered genes. Treatment was tailored for 45% of the patients with a resistance mechanism identified leading to an 11\u00a0months median extension of clinical benefit. A total of 341 biopsies were implanted in mice, successfully establishing 136 PDX models achieving a 39.9% success rate. PDX models are available for EGFR (n\u2009=\u200931), FGFR2/3 (n\u2009=\u200926), KRAS (n\u2009=\u200918), ALK (n\u2009=\u200916), BRAF (n\u2009=\u20096) and NTRK (n\u2009=\u20092) driven cancers. These models closely recapitulate the biology of the original tumors in term of molecular alterations and pharmacological status, and served as valuable models to validate overcoming treatment strategies. The MATCH-R study highlights the feasibility of on purpose image guided tumor biopsies and PDX establishment to characterize resistance mechanisms and guide personalized therapies to improve outcomes in pre-treated metastatic patients.",

Reduced antigen presentation by MHC-I has been identified as potential resistance factor. Here we show that the epigenetic regulator ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 1 (UHRF1), exhibits altered expression and aberrant cytosolic localization in cancerous tissues, where it promotes MHC-I ubiquitination and degradation. Cytoplasmic translocation of UHRF1 is induced by its phosphorylation on a specific serine in response to signals provided by factors present in the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as TGF-\u03b2, enabling UHRF1 to bind MHC-I. Downregulation of MHC-I results in suppression of the antigen presentation pathway to establish an immune hostile TME. UHRF1 inactivation by genetic deletion synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment and induces an anti-tumour memory response by evoking low-affinity T cells. Our study adds to the understanding of UHRF1 in cancer immune evasion and provides a potential target to synergize with immunotherapy and overcome immunotherapeutic resistance.",

          "abstract": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of energy metabolism. AMPK is sensitive to acute perturbations to cellular energy status and leverages fundamental bioenergetic pathways to maintain cellular homeostasis. AMPK is a heterotrimer comprised of \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3-subunits that in humans are encoded by seven individual genes (isoforms \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b31, \u03b32 and \u03b33), permitting formation of at least 12 different complexes with personalised biochemical fingerprints and tissue expression patterns. While the canonical activation mechanisms of AMPK are well-defined, delineation of subtle, as well as substantial, differences in the regulation of heterogenous AMPK complexes remain poorly defined. Here, taking advantage of multidisciplinary findings, we dissect the many aspects of isoform-specific AMPK function and links to health and disease. These include, but are not limited to, allosteric activation by adenine nucleotides and small molecules, co-translational myristoylation and post-translational modifications (particularly phosphorylation), governance of subcellular localisation, and control of transcriptional networks. Finally, we delve into current debate over whether AMPK can form novel protein complexes (e.g., dimers lacking the \u03b1-subunit), altogether highlighting opportunities for future and impactful research. Baseline activity of \u03b11-AMPK is higher than its \u03b12 counterpart and is more sensitive to synergistic allosteric activation by metabolites and small molecules. \u03b12 complexes however, show a greater response to energy stress (i.e., AMP production) and appear to be better substrates for LKB1 and mTORC1 upstream. These differences may explain to some extent why in certain cancers \u03b11 is a tumour promoter and \u03b12 a suppressor. \u03b21-AMPK activity is toggled by a 'myristoyl-switch' mechanism that likely precedes a series of signalling events culminating in phosphorylation by ULK1 and sensitisation to small molecules or endogenous ligands like fatty acids. \u03b22-AMPK, not entirely beholden to this myristoyl-switch, has a greater propensity to infiltrate the nucleus, which we suspect contributes to its oncogenicity in some cancers. Last, the unique N-terminal extensions of the \u03b32 and \u03b33 isoforms are major regulatory domains of AMPK. mTORC1 may directly phosphorylate this region in \u03b32, although whether this is inhibitory, especially in disease states, is unclear. Conversely, \u03b33 complexes might be preferentially regulated by mTORC1 in response to physical exercise.",

OGT catalyzes all nucleocytoplasmic O-GlcNAcylation and due to its essentiality in higher eukaryotes, it is not an ideal drug target. Our glycoproteomics-data revealed that short-term CDK12 inhibition induces hyper-O-GlcNAcylation of the spliceosome-machinery in different models of prostate cancer. By integrating our glycoproteomics-, gene essentiality- and clinical-data from CDK12 mutant prostate cancer patients, we identify the non-essential serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) as a synthetic lethal partner with CDK12-inactivation. Both normal and cancer cells become highly sensitive against inhibitors of OGT and SRPK1 if they have lowered activity of CDK12. Inactivating mutations in CDK12 are enriched in aggressive prostate cancer, and we propose that these patients would benefit from therapy targeting the spliceosome.",

Utilizing data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) databases, we analyzed ARPC1B expression differences in normal, tumor, and adjacent tissues, investigating its correlation with prognosis and clinical stages in various cancers. We conducted gene enrichment analysis and explored ARPC1B's connection to the tumor immune microenvironment and its impact on anti-tumor drug resistance. In addition, <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> experiments have also been carried out to find the mechanism of ARPC1B on ovarian cancer (OV) proliferation and invasion. ARPC1B was highly expressed in 33 tumor types, suggesting its role as a tumor-promoting factor. Its expression correlated with poor prognosis and served as a clinical staging marker in over 10 tumor types. ARPC1B is implicated in various biological processes and signaling pathways, uniquely associated with tumor immunity, indicating immunosuppressive conditions in high-expression cases. High ARPC1B expression was linked to resistance to six anti-tumor drugs. Further experiments showed that ARPC1B can affect the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of OV cells through the AKT/PI3K/mTOR pathway. ARPC1B is a biomarker for immune suppression, prognosis, clinical staging, and drug resistance, providing new insights for cancer therapeutics.",

Thus, identifying the aberrant genes and proteins underlying disease pathogenesis is critical to improve early detection methods and develop novel therapeutic strategies. Chromosome instability (CIN), or ongoing changes in chromosome complements, is a predominant form of genome instability. It is a driver of genetic heterogeneity found in ~85% of CRCs. Although CIN contributes to CRC pathogenesis, the molecular determinants underlying CIN remain poorly understood. Recently, EMI1, an F-box protein, was identified as a candidate CIN gene. In this study, we sought to determine the impact reduced EMI1 expression has on CIN and cellular transformation. Coupling siRNA-based silencing and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout clones with quantitative imaging microscopy we evaluated the impact reduced EMI1 expression has on CIN and cellular transformation in four colonic epithelial cell contexts. Quantitative imaging microscopy data revealed that reduced EMI1 expression induces increases in CIN phenotypes in both transient (siRNA) and constitutive (CRISPR/Cas9) cell models that are associated with increases in DNA damage and cellular transformation phenotypes in long-term studies. This study determined that reduced EMI1 expression induces CIN and promotes cellular transformation, which is consistent with a role in early CRC development.",

While dysregulation of the splicing process is considered a cancer hallmark, the role of certain splicing factors remains unknown in PCa. This study focuses on characterizing the levels and role of SRSF6 in this disease. Comprehensive analyses of SRSF6 alterations (copy number/mRNA/protein) were conducted across eight well-characterized PCa cohorts and the Hi-MYC transgenic model. SRSF6 was up-regulated in PCa samples, correlating with adverse clinical parameters. Functional assays, both in vitro (cell proliferation, migration, colony, and tumorsphere formation) and in vivo (xenograft tumors), demonstrated the impact of SRSF6 modulation on critical cancer hallmarks. Mechanistically, SRSF6 regulates the splicing pattern of the histone-chaperone <i>HIRA</i>, consequently affecting the activity of H3.3 in PCa and breast cancer cell models and disrupting pivotal oncogenic pathways (AR and E2F) in PCa cells. These findings underscore SRSF6 as a promising therapeutic target for PCa/advanced-stage PCa.",

Previously, we found that SCC tissues expressed higher levels of specific proteins at this interface. Ladinin-1 (LAD1) is one of the specific molecules that has increased expressions in cancer fronts; however, its function in OSCC is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the function of LAD1 in human OSCC cells. LAD1 was localized on the actin arc at the distal periphery of cell clusters in the OSCC cell lines HSC-2, HSC-3, and HSC-4. When LAD1 was knocked down, cellular migration was repressed in wound scratch assays but was reversed in three-dimensional collagen gel invasion assays. Characteristic LAD1 localization along actin arcs forming the leading edge of migrating cells was diminished with loss of filopodia formation and ruffling in knockdown cells, in which the expression levels of cell motility-related genes-p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) and caveolin-1 (CAV1)-were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. LAD1 expression was also associated with the downregulation of vimentin and increased histological differentiation of OSCC. These results suggest that LAD1 is involved in actin dynamics during filopodia and lamellipodia formation, and in maintaining the epithelial phenotype of OSCC cells.",

Analysis of 37,542 individuals excluded a major contribution of loss-of-function variants to TRPC6-AP, legitimating current drug discovery approaches. This study identifies key features of disease that can help intervention studies design and suggests similarities between TRPC6-AP and primary FSGS. Understanding the genetic basis of human diseases has become integral to drug development and precision medicine. Recent advancements have enabled the identification of molecular pathways driving diseases, leading to targeted treatment strategies. The increasing investment in rare diseases by the biotech industry underscores the importance of genetic evidence in drug discovery and approval processes. Here we studied a monogenic Mendelian kidney disease, TRPC6-associated podocytopathy (TRPC6-AP), to present its natural history, genetic spectrum, and clinicopathological associations in a large cohort of patients with causal variants in <i>TRPC6</i> to help define the specific features of disease and further facilitate drug development and clinical trials design. The study involved 64 individuals from 39 families with <i>TRPC6</i> causal missense variants. Clinical data, including age of onset, laboratory results, response to treatment, kidney biopsy findings, and genetic information, were collected from multiple centers nationally and internationally. Exome or targeted sequencing was performed, and variant classification was based on strict criteria. Structural and functional analyses of <i>TRPC6</i> variants were conducted to understand their effect on protein function. In-depth reanalysis of light and electron microscopy specimens for nine available kidney biopsies was conducted to identify pathological features and correlates of TRPC6-AP. Large-scale sequencing data did not support causality for <i>TRPC6</i> protein-truncating variants. We identified 21 unique <i>TRPC6</i> missense variants, clustering in three distinct regions of the protein, and with different effects on TRPC6 3D protein structure. Kidney biopsy analysis revealed FSGS patterns of injury in most cases, along with distinctive podocyte features including diffuse foot process effacement and swollen cell bodies. Most patients presented in adolescence or early adulthood but with ample variation (average 22, SD \u00b114 years), with frequent progression to kidney failure but with variability in time between presentation and kidney failure.

We investigated the effects of genetic and pharmacologic modulation of SSTR1 in 22Rv1 cells, a representative mCRPC cell line.RESULTSWe confirmed the predominant role of tumor genetic alterations converging on augmenting androgen receptor (AR) signaling and the increased transcriptional heterogeneity and lineage plasticity during the emergence of ARSI resistance. We further identified amplifications involving a putative enhancer downstream of the AR and transcriptional downregulation of SSTR1, encoding somatostatin receptor 1, in ARSI-resistant tumors. We found that patients with SSTR1-low mCRPC tumors derived less benefit from subsequent ARSI therapy in a retrospective cohort. We showed that SSTR1 was antiproliferative in 22Rv1 cells and that the FDA-approved drug pasireotide suppressed 22Rv1 cell proliferation.CONCLUSIONOur findings expand the knowledge of ARSI resistance and point out actionable next steps, exemplified by potentially targeting SSTR1, to improve patient outcomes.FUNDINGNational Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH; Prostate Cancer Foundation; Conquer Cancer, American Society of Clinical Oncology Foundation; UCSF Benioff Initiative for Prostate Cancer Research; Netherlands Cancer Institute.",

          "abstract": "Prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) is a prevalent global malignancy which depends more on lipid metabolism for tumor progression compared to other cancer types. Although Stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) is documented to regulate lipid metabolism in multiple cancers, landscape analysis of its implications in PRAD are still missing at present. Here, we conducted an analysis of diverse cancer datasets revealing elevated <i>SCD</i> expression in the PRAD cohort at both mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, the elevated expression was associated with <i>SCD</i> promoter hypermethylation and genetic alterations, notably the L134V mutation. Integration of comprehensive tumor immunological and genomic data revealed a robust positive correlation between <i>SCD</i> expression levels and the abundance of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and macrophages. Further analyses identified significant associations between <i>SCD</i> expression and various immune markers in tumor microenvironment. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling unveiled differential <i>SCD</i> expression patterns across distinct cell types within the prostate tumor microenvironment. The Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome analyses showed that <i>SCD</i> enriched pathways were primarily related to lipid biosynthesis, cholesterol biosynthesis, endoplasmic reticulum membrane functions, and various metabolic pathways. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis highlighted the involvement of elevated <i>SCD</i> expression in crucial cellular processes, including the cell cycle and biosynthesis of cofactors pathways. In functional studies, <i>SCD</i> overexpression promoted the proliferation, metastasis and invasion of prostate cancer cells, whereas downregulation inhibits these processes. This study provides comprehensive insights into the multifaceted roles of SCD in PRAD pathogenesis, underscoring its potential as both a therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker.",

This enzyme can act both as a tumor suppressor and oncogene. In this review, we describe the role of p300 in cancer initiation and progression regarding EP300 aberrations that have been identified in TGCA Pan-Cancer Atlas studies and we also discuss possible anticancer strategies that target EP300 mutated cancers. Copy number alterations, truncating mutations, and abnormal EP300 transcriptions that affect p300 abundance and activity are associated with several pathological features such as tumor grading, metastases, and patient survival. Elevated EP300 correlates with a higher mRNA level of other epigenetic factors and chromatin remodeling enzymes that co-operate with p300 in creating permissive conditions for malignant transformation, tumor growth and metastases. The status of EP300 expression can be considered as a prognostic marker for anticancer immunotherapy efficacy, as EP300 mutations are followed by an increased expression of PDL-1.HAT activators such as CTB or YF2 can be applied for p300-deficient patients, whereas the natural and synthetic inhibitors of p300 activity, as well as dual HAT/bromodomain inhibitors and the PROTAC degradation of p300, may serve as strategies in the fight against p300-fueled cancers.",

The treatment of PC-3 cells with 10 \u03bcM IN-3 elevated the expression of kidney type GLS isoform of GLS1 but not GLS2. Comparison of metastatic and localized prostate cancer tissues showed that GLS1 was highly expressed not only in primary but also in metastatic prostate cancer tissues. GLS1 expression was significantly higher than GLS2 expression with p-values lower than 0.001.

          "abstract": "Breast cancer has the highest incidence of all cancer types in women. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15% of all breast cancer cases and is the most aggressive type, with a poor prognosis and limited treatment. Treatment failure in patients is largely due to resistance to chemotherapy. In this study, we aimed to identify the novel factors contributing to chemoresistance in TNBC using cisplatin and 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU). We found that transactivation of the heme-binding protein 2 (<i>HEBP2</i>) gene was common in surviving colonies of cells after exposure to two types of chemotherapeutic agents, namely cisplatin and BCNU, from genome-scale transcriptional activation library screening in the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. Analysis of a public database (Proteogenomic Landscape of Breast Cancer, CPTAC) indicated that <i>HEBP2</i> mRNA expression was elevated in TNBC tissues compared to that in non-TNBC tissues. <i>HEBP2</i> facilitates necrotic cell death under oxidative stress; however, it is not yet known whether <i>HEBP2</i> affects cancer cell survival following chemotherapy. Therefore, we investigated the effects of <i>HEBP2</i> expression on the sensitivity to cisplatin and BCNU in MDA-MB-231 cells. Overexpression of <i>HEBP2</i> significantly enhanced the viability of MDA-MB-231 cells in response to cisplatin and BCNU, but not methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and paclitaxel. In contrast, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated <i>HEBP2</i>-knockout greatly reduced cell viability in response to cisplatin and BCNU, but not to MMS and paclitaxel, in MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, the exogenous introduction of <i>HEBP2</i> restored the resistance of <i>HEBP2</i>-deficient cells to cisplatin and BCNU to wild-type levels. These findings suggest that <i>HEBP2</i> may play a significant role in resistance to cisplatin and BCNU, which induce intrastrand and interstrand DNA crosslinks, but not to monoalkylating or microtubule-stabilizing agents in TNBC cells. The possibility exists that <i>HEBP2</i> serves as a biomarker for predicting response or a therapeutic target for overcoming resistance to platinum-based and alkylating anticancer agents in TNBC.",

          "abstract": "DNAJB6, a major member of the DNAJ/HSP40 family, plays an important role in tumor development. We explored the effect of DNAJB6 expression on the prognosis of patients and its biological role in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). mRNA and clinical data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Enriched pathways were determined by the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. A nomogram incorporating DNAJB6 and three clinical features was constructed to predict the survival rate. DNAJB6 expression and function in LUAD were explored using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, proliferation, cell cycle analysis, RNA sequencing, and xenograft tumor assays. <i>DNAJB6</i> mRNA levels were elevated in the LUAD-TCGA dataset. DNAJB6 protein levels were higher in LUAD tumor tissues than in normal tissues. A high DNAJB6 level was an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in patients with LUAD. The proportion of tumor-infiltrating immune cells significantly differed between high and low <i>DNAJB6</i> expression. DNAJB6 was associated with cell cycle pathways; therefore, its knockdown induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and inhibited LUAD cell proliferation. This is the first report of the DNAJB6 requirement for LUAD cell proliferation and its potentially crucial role in LUAD prognosis.",

          "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) is the most prevalent cancer in the head and neck region, originating from the mucosal epithelium of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx. The solute carrier (SLC) transporter superfamily, consisting of over 400 proteins across 65 families, plays a crucial role in cellular functions and presents promising targets in precision oncology. This study aims to analyze the expression of SLC transporters in HNSC and their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. <b>Methods</b>: We leveraged mRNA and protein expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Human Protein Atlas (HPA) to examine SLC transporter expression in HNSC. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was conducted to assess the involvement of SLC transporters in various oncogenic pathways. <b>Results</b>: Significant upregulation of SLC transporters was observed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, with notable increases in SLC16A3, SLC53A1, SLC25A32, and SLC2A3. This upregulation correlated with poorer overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). GSEA revealed that these transporters are significantly involved in critical oncogenic pathways, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, and hypoxia, which are vital for cancer progression and metastasis. <b>Conclusions</b>: The study identifies SLC transporters as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in HNSC. Targeting these transporters with small molecule inhibitors could disrupt essential supply routes for cancer cells, enhancing treatment efficacy and improving patient outcomes. This study paves the way for developing SLC-based target therapies in precision oncology, with the goal of improving survival rates for patients with HNSC.",

          "abstract": "In colorectal cancer (CRC), attempts to identify cancer cell-specific markers to guide antibody-mediated therapeutics have failed to uncover markers that are both exclusive to cancer tissues and abundant across CRCs. Alternatively, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are abundant in the tumor microenvironment and upregulate unique surface markers, are not found in healthy tissues. Here, we evaluated the expression patterns of CAF-associated proteins \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), fibroblast activation protein (FAP), podoplanin (PDPN), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), transgelin (TAGLN), and THY1. While \u03b1SMA and THY1 were abundant in cancer tissues, high abundance in normal tissues limited their targeting potential. FAP was present in 94.5% of primary and metastatic CRC tissues and absent in 93.7% of adjacent normal colon and liver tissues assessed. These results indicate that FAP is a promising target for antibody conjugates with potential for broad application in CRC. Co-expression analyses showed that CRCs simultaneously expressing high levels of PDPN, MMP2, and THY1 were enriched for immune-related signatures, indicating potential for antibody-mediated immune engagers. Overall, this work highlights the potential of CAF proteins to act as therapeutic targets for novel anticancer agents and become important therapeutic biomarkers.",

The correlation between ACTL6A expression and survival in pan-cancer were analyzed by \"survival\", \"survminer\" R package and PrognoScan database. STRING (v 11.0) and stringAPP for Cytoscape v3.7.2 were used to predict ACTL6A associated genes. Copy number and methylation alterations of ACTL6A were analyzed using cBioPortal and GSCALite.

Correlations analysis between ACTL6A and immune cells were performed using TIMER and GEPIA database. In our studies, we found that ACTL6A was widely upregulated in cancers, which might be attributed to its gene amplifications. Moreover, ACTL6A might regulated by transcription factors (TFs), including E2F1, YY1, CDX2 and HOXD10. In addition, high ACTL6A expression was associated with poor prognosis in most cancers. Meanwhile, ACTL6A was associated with the infiltration of immune cells, especially in liver hepatocellular carcinoma and brain lower grade glioma.

Furthermore, we examined the relationship between ATAD2 and immune infiltration utilizing single-cell sequencing data and TCGA database. Additionally, the expression and oncogenic functions of ATAD2 were verified in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) through MTT, wound-healing, transwell, and flow cytometry assays. Our results revealed significant overexpression of ATAD2 in most cancers, strongly associated with poor prognosis. Amplification was the most frequent alteration type of ATAD2, with its mutation correlating with improved overall survival. ATAD2 was positively correlated with multiple inhibitory immune checkpoints and closely associated with the immunosuppressive microenvironment, particularly in PTC. In vitro experiments demonstrated that ATAD2 promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PTC cells by activating the PI3K-AKT pathway and modulating the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint. Collectively, ATAD2 holds promise as a biomarker for pan-cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as well as a predictor of immunotherapeutic responsiveness and a therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of existing anti-tumor immune therapies.",

          "abstract": "Undifferentiated melanoma, defined as melanoma that has lost all usual phenotypic and immunohistochemical characteristics of conventional melanoma, can pose significant diagnostic challenges. Molecular studies have advanced our understanding of undifferentiated melanoma by demonstrating that a subset of these tumors harbors known melanoma driver alterations in genes such as BRAF, NRAS, and NF1. However, there is a paucity of data describing genetic alterations that may distinguish undifferentiated melanoma from conventional melanoma. In this study, we directly compared the genomic profiles of undifferentiated melanoma to a cohort of conventional melanomas, including 14 undifferentiated melanoma cases (comprised of 2 primary cases, 2 cutaneous recurrences, and 10 metastases) and a cohort of 127 conventional melanomas including primary, recurrent, and metastatic cases. Targeted sequencing of 447 cancer-associated genes was performed, including identification of mutations and copy number alterations. NRAS was the most frequent melanoma driver in undifferentiated melanoma (8/14 cases, 57%), although notably, only 1 undifferentiated melanoma harbored an NRAS Q61R mutation. Compared with the conventional melanoma cohort, undifferentiated melanoma demonstrated statistically significant enrichment of pathogenic activating RAC1 mutations (6/14 total cases, 43%), including P29S (4/6 cases), P29L (1/6 cases), and D11E (1/6 cases). In addition to providing insight into the molecular pathogenesis of undifferentiated melanoma, these findings also suggest that RAS Q61R immunohistochemistry may have limited utility for its diagnosis. The presence of recurrent RAC1 mutations in undifferentiated melanoma is also notable as these alterations may contribute to mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway-targeted therapy resistance. Furthermore, the RAC1 alterations identified in this cohort have been shown to drive a melanocytic to mesenchymal switch in melanocytes, offering a possible explanation for the undifferentiated phenotype of these melanomas.",

The standard of care is chemotherapy, but approximately 50% of tumors develop resistance. We performed gene expression profiling of 58 TNBC tumor samples by microarray, comparing chemosensitive with chemoresistant tumors, which revealed that one of the top upregulated genes was TGF\u03b22. A connectivity mapping bioinformatics analysis predicted that the SRC inhibitor Dasatinib was a potential pharmacological inhibitor of chemoresistant TNBCs. Claudin-low TNBC cell lines were selected to represent poor-outcome, chemoresistant TNBC, for in vitro experiments and in vivo models. In vitro, we identified a signaling axis linking SRC, AKT and ERK2, which in turn upregulated the stability of the transcription factors, Slug and Snail. Slug was shown to repress TGF\u03b22-antisense 1 to promote TGF\u03b22 signaling, upregulating cell survival via apoptosis and DNA-damage responses. Additionally, an orthotopic allograft in vivo model demonstrated that the SRC inhibitor Dasatinib reduced tumor growth as a single agent, and enhanced responses to the TNBC mainstay drug, Epirubicin. Targeting the SRC-Slug-TGF\u03b22 axis may therefore lead to better treatment options and improve patient outcomes in this highly aggressive subpopulation of TNBCs.",

Rare IDH mutations have been described in prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa). Recent publications have suggested that psammomatous calcifications in PCa are associated with IDH1 mutations. In this retrospective study, we queried our institutional clinical sequencing database (cohort 1), and previously published PCa data sets in cBioPortal (cohort 2). Samples were stratified based on oncogenic hotspot IDH mutations at IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R140/R172, and other nonhotspot IDH mutations. Seventeen (0.4%) cases were identified from 4033 PCa cases in cohort 1 harboring mutually exclusive oncogenic hotspot IDH1 (N\u00a0= 15, 1 of which was subclonal) or IDH2 (N\u00a0= 2) mutations, and 20 (0.5%) cases had nonhotspot IDH1/2 mutations. A histologic review of 13 cases with IDH1 hotspot mutations and available material showed grade group 3 or higher disease. Immunohistochemistry was performed on cases with IDH1 hotspot mutations when possible and showed AR, PSA, PSMA, and NKX3.1 positive in all the 4 cases stained. In cohort 2, 9 cases (0.3%) harboring IDH1 hotspot mutations were identified from 2749 patients, and 9 cases carried nonhotspot IDH1/2 mutations. The combined cohorts of 23 PCa cases with clonal IDH1 hotspot mutations had no ETS fusions, SPOP hotspot mutations, and somatic or germline alterations in BRCA1/2, ATM, RB1, or AR; 19 cases with successful microsatellite instability testing were all microsatellite stable. Conversely, among 29 cases with nonhotspot IDH mutations, there were 4 with TMPRSS2::ERG fusions, 6 with SPOP hotspot mutations, and 10 with AR amplifications/hotspot mutations; 8 were microsatellite instability high. Notably, two cases with IDH1 hotspot mutations had psammomatous calcifications. Our findings provide evidence that IDH1 hotspot mutations serve as driver alterations in this rare yet distinct molecular subset of PCa. Further studies are warranted to correlate response to androgen deprivation and IDH inhibitors.",

Our bioinformatic analysis reveals that HIF1A mRNA expression is significantly upregulated in both LUAD and LUSC samples compared to non-tumorous lung tissues. The overexpression is positively correlated with increased copy number variation and negatively associated with promoter methylation. However, meta-analysis and survival analyses revealed a pronounced association between elevated HIF1A expression and poor clinical outcome specifically within the LUAD subset, with no such correlation evident in LUSC. Additionally, we explored the interplay between HIF1A expression, leukocyte infiltration, and the presence of immunosuppressive markers, revealing HIF1A's suppressive role in cytotoxicity against cancer cells. Furthermore, we performed in silico prediction to explore the correlations between HIF1A and its interacting proteins, associated pathways, glycolysis, and m<sup>6</sup>A modification, and the feasibility of targeting HIF1A with specific drugs.

Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) can emerge during hormone therapy for PCa, manifesting with elevated serum prostate-specific antigen levels, continued disease progression, and/or metastasis to the new sites, resulting in a poor prognosis. A subset of CRPC patients shows a neuroendocrine (NE) phenotype, signifying reduced or no reliance on androgen receptor signaling and a particularly unfavorable prognosis. In this study, we incorporated computational approaches based on both gene expression profiles and protein-protein interaction networks. We identified 500 potential marker genes, which are significantly enriched in cell cycle and neuronal processes. The top 40 candidates, collectively named CDHu40, demonstrated superior performance in distinguishing NE PCa (NEPC) and non-NEPC samples based on gene expression profiles. CDHu40 outperformed most of the other published marker sets, excelling particularly at the prognostic level. Notably, some marker genes in CDHu40, absent in the other marker sets, have been reported to be associated with NEPC in the literature, such as DDC, FOLH1, BEX1, MAST1, and CACNA1A. Importantly, elevated CDHu40 scores derived from our predictive model showed a robust correlation with unfavorable survival outcomes in patients, indicating the potential of the CDHu40 score as a promising indicator for predicting the survival prognosis of those patients with the NE phenotype. Motif enrichment analysis on the top candidates suggests that REST and E2F6 may serve as key regulators in the NEPC progression.",

The study leveraged data from the TCGA and GTEx databases to explore the clinical significance, metabolic features, and immunological characteristics of NLRP1, employing various tools such as R, GEPIA, STRING and TISIDB. NLRP1 exhibited differential expression patterns across various cancers, with elevated expression correlating with a more favourable prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). Downregulation of NLRP1 reduced tumour metabolic activity in LUAD. Moreover, the mutational signature of NLRP1 was linked to a favourable prognosis. Interestingly, high NLRP1 expression inversely correlated with tumour stemness while positively correlating with tumour immune infiltration in various cancers including LUAD and PAAD. Through extensive big data analysis, we delved into the role of NLRP1 across various tumour types, constructing a comprehensive role map of its involvement in pan-cancer scenarios.

          "abstract": "MiR-105 exerts inhibitory effects on the development and progression of various cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and gastric cancer. Through GEO data analysis, we observed decreased expression of miR-105 in liver cancer tissues compared to adjacent tissues. Furthermore, miR-105 downregulates KIFC1 expression levels by targeting its 3' UTR. KIFC1 (Kinesin Family Member C1), a Protein Coding gene, may play a role in mitotic metaphase plate polymerization and mitotic spindle assembly. However, our findings suggest that this gene could serve as a potential chemotherapeutic target for Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). We obtained the LIHC dataset from the TCGA database and genotype Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) normal tissue data for differential analysis. Additionally, we utilized the cBioPortal database, tumor immune single-cell center (TISCH) database, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and R software to investigate the possible functions and mechanisms of KIFC1. These findings were further validated through experiments such as immunohistochemistry and wound healing assays. Our results indicate that KIFC1 might be involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation in LIHC cells which subsequently impacts tumor cell proliferation; moreover, miR-105 influences hepatoma cell line proliferation via its interaction with KIFC1. Collectively, these results highlight the potential therapeutic significance of targeting KIFC1 for chemotherapy treatment in LIHC patients.",

This study investigates the correlation between <i>HIF1A</i> gene-altered expression and hypoxia in Bangladeshi breast cancer (BC) cases and TCGA_BC datasets. This case-control study compares BC cases to healthy controls to understand the relationship between gene changes and cancer. This study used advanced analysis methods to examine the transcriptional landscape of BC, and quantitatively assessed its correlation using integrated multi-omics analysis. In Bangladeshi BC cases, the T allele of <i>HIF1A</i> rs1154946 correlates notably (<i>P</i>-value\u2009<\u2009.001) with BC incidence. ELISA results confirmed a significant association (<i>P</i>-value\u2009<\u2009.005) between elevated <i>HIF1A</i> expression and BC-related hypoxia. Bioinformatics eQTL analysis validated the correlation between increased <i>HIF1A</i> expression and rs11549465 T allele (<i>P</i>-value\u2009<\u2009.01). Structural analyses suggested that rs11549465 (P582S) mutation may decrease protein stability (\u0394\u0394G-value: -1.24\u2009kcal/mole), potentially affecting <i>HIF1A</i> function. <i>HIF1A</i> enrichment analysis in BC underscores strong associations with oxygen levels, hypoxia, metabolic processes, apoptosis, and programed cell death (<i>P</i>-value\u2009<\u2009.001). Transcriptomic data demonstrated a robust correlation (<i>P</i>-value\u2009<\u2009.0001) between <i>HIF1A</i> expression and copy-number alterations, mutations, and abnormal methylation. Altered <i>HIF1A</i> expression showed strong negative correlations (<i>P</i>-value\u2009<\u2009.00001) with methylation and the expression of the ER (<i>ESR1</i>), in Whites. Survival analysis revealed marked differences in overall survival linked to high and low <i>HIF1A</i> expression (<i>P</i>-value\u2009<\u2009.00001). Furthermore, <i>HIF1A</i> expression significantly correlated (<i>P</i>-value\u2009<\u2009.000001) with hypoxia, TMB, MSI, and immune infiltration by CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, dendritic, and macrophages, providing deeper insights into the BC microenvironment. Thus, the <i>HIF1A</i> gene could serve as a promising biomarker for breast cancer progression, control, and survival across ethnicities, emphasizing its role in disease development and regulation.",

          "abstract": "Minichromosome maintenance complex component 3 (MCM3) plays a key role in various tumours. However, it remains largely unknown what the specific role and clinical significance of MCM3 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) are. We integrated high-throughput data from PAAD worldwide to analyse the expression level of MCM3 mRNA. We used immunohistochemistry to analyse MCM3 protein expression levels in 145 cases in the PAAD group and 29 cases in the non-PAAD group. We also mainly analysed the necessity of MCM3 for PAAD growth based on CRISPR screen data. In addition, we used enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction networks to explore the molecular mechanism of MCM3 in PAAD. We also analysed the correlation between MCM3 expression, components of the immune microenvironment in PAAD tissue and clinical prognosis. In PAAD, we observed for the first time that MCM3 was significantly highly expressed at both the mRNA (SMD = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.38\u2009\u223c\u20090.96) and the protein level (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). The mRNA (AUC = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.74\u2009\u223c\u20090.81; sensitivity = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.55\u2009\u223c\u20090.76; specificity = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.67\u2009\u223c\u20090.84) and protein (AUC = 0.929) expression levels of MCM3 had a good ability to distinguish between PAAD and non-PAAD tissue. There was heterogeneity reflected by the differential expression of MCM3 protein in PAAD cells. MCM3 played an essential role in PAAD growth, through abnormal DNA replication, p53 signalling and cell cycle checkpoints. PAAD with high MCM3 expression was sensitive to c-75, brivanib, flavopiridol and VNLG/124 drugs, with stable molecular docking models. MCM3 is likely to be a critical element in promoting the initiation and growth of PAAD. Flavopiridol may exert its anti-PAAD effect through the interaction between MCM3, classic CDK1 targets in the cell cycle checkpoint and p53 pathway as well as related molecules in other pathways.",

This study investigates genetic alterations affecting IGFBP1 expression in tumors using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PanCancer Atlas via cBioPortal. We analyzed samples from 32 cancer types for mutation sites, including deep deletions, amplifications, and mutations. RNA-seq data were normalized using log2(value\u00a0+\u00a01). Statistical analyses, including survival outcomes, were conducted using R packages like ggplot2, stats, and car. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests assessed overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Univariate Cox regression was used to develop nomogram models for OS. Functional consequences of IGFBP1 mutations were explored through protein structure, stability, and IGF interaction analyses. Protein-protein interaction networks and functional enrichment were analyzed using GEPIA2, STRING, and Cytoscape. Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) provided insights into affected biological pathways. Pan-cancer analysis revealed diverse expression patterns, including significant upregulation in cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) and downregulation in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD). Specifically, elevated IGFBP1 expression in SKCM patients led to a 25\u00a0% improvement in 5-year survival. In contrast, higher <i>IGFBP1</i> levels in LUAD and OV patients resulted in a 30\u00a0% and 20\u00a0% decrease in survival, respectively. Elevated <i>IGFBP1</i> levels are significantly linked to advanced tumor stage and grade in OV and LUAD, affecting prognostic outcomes. Nomogram models for OV, SKCM, LUAD, and STAD showed <i>IGFBP1</i>'s predictive strength with AUC values ranging from 0.70 to 0.85, indicating its diagnostic potential. Genetic analyses revealed mutations in IGFBP1 in 12\u00a0% of STAD cases and 10\u00a0% of UCEC cases, indicating significant genetic variation. Immune analysis showed that high <i>IGFBP1</i> expression significantly influenced immune cell infiltration, particularly macrophages and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, thereby affecting survival in LUAD and OV. Functional enrichment and gene set enrichment analysis identified <i>IGFBP1</i> involvement in crucial pathways, such as cell cycle regulation, immune response, and PD-1 signaling, highlighting its biological impact. Additionally, <i>IGFBP1</i> expression delineates distinct molecular and immune subtypes, correlating with specific cancer behaviors and immune patterns. These findings highlight IGFBP1's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target, particularly for immunoregulation and cancer subtype stratification.",

While prior studies have linked aberrant expression of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) to various cancer types, its precise role has remained elusive. Recently, we observed that FGF8 silencing reduces the cancer-promoting properties of ovarian cancer cells, and thus, this study aimed to understand how FGF8 regulates the development of ovarian cancer. LC-MS/MS-based quantitative proteomics analysis identified 418 DEPs, and most of them were downregulated in FGF8-silenced ovarian cancer cells. Many of these DEPs are associated with cancer progression and unfavorable prognosis. To decipher the biological significance of DEPs, bioinformatics analyses encompassing gene ontology, pathway analysis, protein-protein interaction networks, and expression analysis of hub genes were carried out. Hub genes identified in the FGF8 protein network were upregulated in ovarian cancer compared to controls and were linked to poor prognosis. Subsequently, the expression of hub genes was correlated with patient survival and regulation of the tumor microenvironment. Conclusively, FGF8 and associated hub genes help in the progression of ovarian cancer, and their overexpression may lead to higher immune infiltration, poor prognosis, and poor survival.",

However, comprehensive pan-cancer analyses have not been conducted to investigate its role in diagnosis, prognosis and immunological prediction. By conducting comprehensive analysis of patient data obtained from publicly available databases, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), University of Alabama at Birmingham (UALCAN), The Comparative Toxicological Genomics Database (CTD), cBioportal, cancerSEA, and UCSC, we systematically investigated the differential expression of LY6H in 33 different types of human tumors. Additionally, we thoroughly analyzed the diagnostic, prognostic, and immunoinfiltration value of LY6H. Simultaneously, we examined the correlation between LY6H and tumor stemness, methylation patterns, drug sensitivity, gene alterations as well as single cell functions. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction networks and gene-gene interaction networks for LY6H were constructed. Moreover, we also explored the network relationship between LY6H and chemical compounds or genes. The results revealed that LY6H exhibited high expression levels in most cancers which were further validated through Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis using Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples. Moreover, LY6H displayed early diagnostic potential in 12 tumors while also showing positive or negative correlations with prognosis across different tumor types. Additionally, it was found that LY6H played a pivotal role in regulating immune-infiltrating cells across multiple cancers whereas the correlation between LY6H expression and immune-related genes varied depending on their specific types. Furthermore, the expression of LY6H was significantly associated with DNA methylation patterns in 21 cancers. Therefore, LY6H could serve as an adjunctive biomarker for early tumor detection as well as a prognostic indicator for diverse malignancies.",

Therefore, the identification of biomarkers associated with the diagnosis and prognosis of PCa holds paramount importance in patient health management. The datasets pertaining to PCa were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to investigate the modules specifically associated with the diagnosis of PCa. The hub genes were identified using the LASSO regression analysis. The expression levels of these hub genes were further validated by qRT-PCR experiments. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and nomograms were employed as evaluative measures for assessing the diagnostic value. The blue module identified by WGCNA exhibited a strong association with PCa. Six hub genes (SLC14A1, COL4A6, MYOF, FLRT3, KRT15, and LAMB3) were identified by LASSO regression analysis. Further verification confirmed that these six genes were significantly downregulated in tumor tissues and cells. The six hub genes and the nomogram demonstrated substantial diagnostic value, with area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.754 to 0.961. Moreover, patients with low expression levels of these six genes exhibited elevated T/N pathological stage and Gleason score, implying a more advanced disease state. Meanwhile, their progression-free survival (PFS) was observed to be potentially poorer. Finally, a significant association could be observed between the expression of these genes and the dysregulation of immune cells, along with drug sensitivity. In summary, our study identified six hub genes, namely SLC14A1, COL4A6, MYOF, FLRT3, KRT15, and LAMB3, which can be utilized to establish a diagnostic model for PCa.

This approach identifies 13 protein assemblies for which the assembly-level mutation burden (AMB) predicts treatment outcomes, which can be combined to powerfully separate responders from nonresponders in multiple cohorts (e.g., 76% versus 37% bladder cancer 1-year survival). These results are corroborated by (i) engineered disruptions in the predictive assemblies, which modulate immunotherapy response in mice, and (ii) histochemistry showing that predicted responders have elevated inflammation. The 13 assemblies have diverse roles in DNA damage checkpoints, oxidative stress, or Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling and include unexpected genes (e.g., PIK3CG and FOXP1) for which mutation affects treatment response.

          "abstract": "Androgen receptor inhibitors are commonly used for prostate cancer treatment, but acquired resistance is a significant problem. Codeletion of RB and p53 is common in castration resistant prostate cancers, however they are difficult to target pharmacologically. To comprehensively identify gene loss events that contribute to enzalutamide response, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. This revealed novel genes implicated in resistance that are largely unstudied. Gene loss events that confer enzalutamide sensitivity are enriched for GSEA categories related to stem cell and epigenetic regulation. We investigated the myeloid lineage stem cell factor HOXA9 as a candidate gene whose loss promotes sensitivity to enzalutamide. Cancer genomic data reveals that HOXA9 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and characteristics of advanced prostate cancer. In cell culture, HOXA9 depletion sensitizes cells to enzalutamide, whereas overexpression drives enzalutamide resistance. Combination of the HOXA9 inhibitor DB818 with enzalutamide demonstrates synergy. This demonstrates the utility of our CRISPR screen data in discovering new approaches for treating enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer.",

          "abstract": "The prognosis of breast cancer patients with visceral metastasis (VM) is significantly worse than that of patients without VM. We aimed to evaluate EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) mutation as a biomarker associated with VM. Data from forty-nine patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) pathologically confirmed at our hospital between March 2016 and September 2018 were collected. Metastatic tissue samples were obtained via ultrasound-guided needle biopsy, and paired peripheral blood samples were also collected. Tissue and blood samples were subjected to targeted next-generation sequencing via a 247-gene panel. Stably transfected MDA-MB-231 cells expressing wild-type EZH2 (EZH2<sup>WT</sup>) or a mutant form of EZH2 (EZH2<sup>K515R</sup>) were generated. Cell proliferation, colony formation ability, migration and invasion abilities and apoptosis were assessed using CCK-8 assays, plate colony formation assays, Transwell chamber assays and flow cytometry. The incidence of EZH2 mutations in the VM subgroup was greater than that in the non-VM subgroup in the entire cohort (n\u2009=\u200949, 42.3% vs. 13.0%, p\u2009=\u20090.024) and in the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subgroup (n\u2009=\u200920, 50.0% vs. 10.0%, p\u2009=\u20090.05). Patients carrying EZH2 mutations had a significantly greater risk of developing VM than did those in the non-EZH2 mutation group in the entire cohort (HR 2.9) and in the TNBC subgroup (HR 6.45). Multivariate analysis revealed that EZH2 mutation was an independent prognostic factor for VM (HR 2.99, p\u2009=\u20090.009) in the entire cohort and in the TNBC subgroup (HR 10.1, p\u2009=\u20090.006). Data from cBioPortal also showed that patients with EZH2 mutations had a significantly greater risk of developing VM (HR 3.1), and the time to develop VM was significantly earlier in the EZH2 mutation group (31.5 months vs. 109.7 months, p\u2009=\u20090.008). Multivariate analysis revealed that EZH2 mutation (HR 2.73, p\u2009=\u20090.026) was an independent factor for VM after breast cancer surgery. There was no correlation between EZH2 mutations and BRCA1/2 mutations. Most of the patients (81.8%) in our cohort who developed VM carried the \"c.1544A\u2009>\u2009G (p.K515R)\" mutation. Compared with EZH2<sup>WT</sup> MDA-MB-231 cells, EZH2<sup>K515R</sup> MDA-MB-231 cells had greater colony formation rates (p\u2009<\u20090.01), greater migration and invasion rates (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and lower apoptosis rates (p\u2009<\u20090.01). The proportion of S\u2009+\u2009G2/M phase cells in the EZH2<sup>K515R</sup> group was significantly greater than that in the EZH2<sup>WT</sup> group. EZH2 mutation is associated with VM development in breast cancer patients. The EZH2<sup>K515R</sup> mutation leads to VM and a poor prognosis by enhancing proliferation and invasion and inhibiting apoptosis in breast cancer cells.",

Here, we examine chromosome copy number changes in cancers from more than 1800 self-reported Black patients. We find that tumors from self-reported Black patients are significantly more likely to exhibit whole-genome duplications (WGDs), a genomic event that enhances metastasis and aggressive disease, compared to tumors from self-reported white patients. This increase in WGD frequency is observed across multiple cancer types, including breast, endometrial, and lung cancer, and is associated with shorter patient survival. We further demonstrate that combustion byproducts are capable of inducing WGDs in cell culture, and cancers from self-reported Black patients exhibit mutational signatures consistent with exposure to these carcinogens. In total, these findings identify a type of genomic alteration that is associated with environmental exposures and that may influence racial disparities in cancer outcomes.",

          "abstract": "We characterized tumor prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) levels as a reflection of cancer biology and treatment sensitivities for treatment-na\u00efve prostate cancer. We first correlated PSMA positron emission tomography (PET) maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) in primary prostate cancer with tumor FOLH1 (PSMA RNA abundance) to establish RNA as a proxy (n\u00a0=\u00a055). We then discovered and validated molecular pathways associated with PSMA RNA levels in two large primary tumor cohorts. We validated those associations in independent cohorts (18 total; 5684 tumor samples) to characterize the pathways and treatment responses associated with PSMA. PSMA RNA abundance correlates moderately with SUVmax (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.41). In independent cohorts, androgen receptor signaling is more active in tumors with high PSMA. Accordingly, patients with high PSMA tumors experienced longer cancer-specific survival when managed with androgen deprivation therapy for biochemical recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 0.54 [0.34-0.87]; n\u00a0=\u00a0174). PSMA low tumors possess molecular markers of resistance to radiotherapy. Consistent with this, patients with high PSMA tumors experience longer time to recurrence following primary radiotherapy (AHR 0.50 [0.28-0.90]; n\u00a0=\u00a0248). In the SAKK09/10 trial (n\u00a0=\u00a0224), patients with high PSMA tumors who were managed with salvage radiotherapy experienced longer time to progression in the 64-Gy arm (restricted mean survival time [RMST] +7.60 [0.05-15.16]), but this effect was mitigated in the 70-Gy arm (RMST 3.52 [-3.30 to 10.33]). Limitations include using PSMA RNA as a surrogate for PET SUVmax. PSMA levels in treatment-na\u00efve prostate cancer differentiate tumor biology and treatment susceptibilities. These results warrant validation using PET metrics to substantiate management decisions based on imaging.",

Evidence from cell lines and human tissues indicates that ANAXs are involved in kidney clear renal cell carcinoma (KIRC) tumorigenesis. However, their prognostic value and expression pattern associated with KIRC remain to be elucidated. We visited public databases, including ONCOMINE, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), Kaplan-Meier plotter, cBioPortal, and GeneMANIA, to conduct comprehensive bioinformatics analysis and tried to detect basic relationships between each Annexins family member and KIRC. We found that the expression level of ANXA1/2/4/5/6/7/8/13 in clear renal cell carcinoma tissue was higher than that in the kidney tissue, while the expression level of ANXA3/9/11 in the former was lower than that in the latter. The expression level of ANXA7/8/13 is related to the stage of the tumour. Survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier plotter database showed that a high transcription level of ANXA2/5/8/10 is related to a low overall survival rate (OS) in predicting KIRC patients. In contrast, high ANXA3/4/7/9/11/13 levels are associated with a high OS in these patients. Our study implies that ANXA4/8/13 are potential targets of precision therapy for patients with KIRC and that ANXA2/5/8/10 are new biomarkers for the prognosis of KIRC.",

To date, the pathologic features of HPV-associated OCSCC (HPV(\u2009+)-OCSCC) have been sparsely reported and its prognosis is not well-defined. We herein described detailed clinicopathologic features and outcomes of a retrospective series of 27 HPV(\u2009+)-OCSCC, including 13 from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and 14 from The Cancer Genomic Atlas program (TCGA). The frequency of HPV positivity in OCSCC was 0.7% in MSKCC cohort and 4.9% in TCGA cohort. Although HPV(\u2009+)-OCSCC was predominantly non-keratinizing (in 81%) with various degree of maturation, its histologic spectrum was expanded to include keratinizing subtype (19%), adenosquamous carcinoma (7%), and papillary architecture (subtype, 7%). HPV(\u2009+)-OCSCC predominantly affected male patients (male:female ratio\u2009=\u200912.5:1) and (ex) smokers (77%). It might occur in mandibular mucosa, floor of mouth, tongue, retromolar trigone, buccal mucosa, maxillary mucosa, or hard palate. In oral cavity, positivity of HPV by RNA in situ hybridization was required, and p16 immunohistochemistry alone was insufficient to confirm the HPV\u2009+\u2009status. The positive predictive value of p16 immunopositivity in detecting HPV infection was 68%. HPV-positivity did not appear to affect outcomes, including disease specific survival and progression free survival in OCSCC.",

The current treatment modality for HNSC patients primarily involves surgical intervention and radiotherapy, but its therapeutic efficacy remains limited. The mRNA vaccine based on tumor antigens seems promising for cancer treatment. Ferroptosis, a novel form of cell death, is linked to tumor progression and cancer immunotherapy. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of ferroptosis-associated tumor antigens in treating HNSC remains uncertain. In this study, we identified three ferroptosis-associated tumor antigens, namely caveolin1 (CAV1), ferritin heavy chain (FTH1), and solute carrier 3A2 (SLC3A2), as being overexpressed and mutated based on data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. These antigens were strongly associated with poor prognosis and infiltration of antigen-presenting cells in HNSC. We further identified two ferroptosis subtypes (FS1 and FS2) with distinct molecular, cellular, and clinical properties to identify antigen-sensitive individuals. Our findings indicate that FS1 exhibits an immune \"hot\" phenotype, whereas FS2 displays an immune \"cold\" phenotype. Additionally, differential expression of immunogenic cell death modulators and immune checkpoints was observed between these two immune subtypes. Further exploration of the HNSC's immune landscape revealed significant heterogeneity among individual patients. Our findings suggest that CAV1, FTH1, and SLC3A2 are potential targets to prevent HNSC in FS2 patients. Overall, our research reveals the potential of ferroptosis-associated mRNA vaccines for HNSC and identifies an effective patient population for vaccine treatment.",

Data from various comprehensive gene expression platforms like UALCAN, GEPIA2, GENT2, TIMER2, LinkedOmics, and STRING were used to analyse the expression of \u03b2-hCG and its clinical implications; Immunohistochemistry and ELISA for \u03b2-hCG expression analysis from human breast cancer patients; Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to analyse the direct binding of BRCA1 on \u03b2-hCG; Immunoblotting and Luciferase assay to understand the regulation of \u03b2-hCG by p53 were performed. Results from UALCAN and GENT2 gene expression cancer database revealed that TNBC subtypes and high-grade metaplastic carcinoma shows elevated expression of \u03b2-hCG and infiltration of various immune cells were also identified in BRCA by TIMER2. It was observed that most of the isoforms of \u03b2-hCG (CGB) are upregulated in breast cancers irrespective of hormonal status when BRCA1 gene is mutated according to TIMER2. Similar results were observed with Lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (LGG) and DLBC (Brain lower grade glioma) when BRCA1 is mutated. These results correlate with our earlier reports indicating expression of \u03b2-hCG in BRCA1 defective condition. We have also identified direct binding of BRCA1 on \u03b2-hCG promoter.

Current methods to do so are limited by computational scalability and rely on technical assumptions that do not reflect current clinical knowledge. Metient overcomes these limitations using gradient-based, multi-objective optimization to generate multiple hypotheses of metastatic spread and rescores these hypotheses using independent data on genetic distance and organotropism. Unlike current methods, Metient can be used with both clinical sequencing data and barcode-based lineage tracing in preclinical models, enhancing its translatability across systems. In a reanalysis of metastasis in 169 patients and 490 tumors, Metient automatically identifies cancer type-specific trends of metastatic dissemination in melanoma, high-risk neuroblastoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. Its reconstructions often align with expert analyses but frequently reveal more plausible migration histories, including those with more metastasis-to-metastasis seeding and higher polyclonal seeding, offering new avenues for targeting metastatic cells. Metient's findings challenge existing assumptions about metastatic spread, enhance our understanding of cancer type-specific metastasis, and offer insights that inform future clinical treatment strategies of metastasis.",

The expressions of copper transporters in 33 tumors and normal tissues were analyzed using TCGA, GTEx, CCLE, ULCAN, and HPA databases. Cox regression assessed their impact on patient survival. Gene alterations were explored using cBioPortal. Spearman correlation tests were performed to investigate the associations between copper transporters and tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and infiltration of immune cells. Gene functions were analyzed using STRING and GeneMANIA databases. Drug sensitivity was assessed using GSCALite database. <i>ATP7B</i> expression in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) was validated by immunohistochemical staining. Copper transporters exhibited variable expression patterns across various cancer types, indicating their potential dual role as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, depending on the cancer type. Significant associations were found between these transporters and tumor stage, as well as prognosis in most tumors studied. Pathway analysis identified links between copper transporters and tumor-related pathways like apoptosis and RAS/MAPK. Copy number variation (CNV) analysis revealed varying degrees of gene amplification and deletion of copper transporters in most tumors. Copper transporters exhibited strong correlations with immune features, including TMB, MSI, and immune-infiltrating cells, suggesting their potential role in guiding immunotherapy. They were also associated with sensitivity to various chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic drugs. Immunohistochemical tests validated the correlation between elevated <i>ATP7B</i> level and worse progression-free survival (PFS) in LUSC.

The metadata approach describes generalizable descriptors for computational models, and outlines how to profit from existing data resources for validating computational models.

          "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, posing a significant clinical challenge due to its complex tumor microenvironment (TME) and metabolic heterogeneity. Despite continuous improvements in treatment strategies including surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapies, the metabolic reprogramming in GC continues to impede treatment efficacy, highlighting an urgent need for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This persistent issue underscores the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches that can effectively address the diverse and dynamic characteristics of GC. Cimifugin, a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has garnered attention for its potential role in alleviating inflammation, neurological disorders, pain, and metabolic disorders. Its multi-targeting properties and minimal side effects suggest a broad potential for cancer management, which is currently being explored. This study aims to delineate the molecular mechanisms that cimifugin may impact within the TME and metabolic pathways of GC, with the expectation of contributing to a deeper understanding of GC and the development of innovative treatment strategies. We identified the GC-related TME cell types and metabolic profiles and pathways by using relevant data from the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) database GSE134520 and the stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We also assessed the effects of cimifugin on MKN28 cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. By using six public platforms, we comprehensively predicted the potential biological targets of cimifugin. Clinical prognosis and immunohistochemistry (IHC), molecular docking, and dynamics simulations were used to confirm the clinical relevance and stability of the aforementioned targets. Cimifugin inhibited MKN28 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Cimifugin may potentially act on various metabolic pathways in GC, including folate biosynthesis, xenobiotic metabolism via cytochrome P450 (CYP), glutathione metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and tryptophan metabolism. Cimifugin was noted to stably bind to three significant core targets associated with metabolic reprogramming in GC: AKR1C2, MAOB, and PDE2A; all three targets were strongly expressed in endocrince cells, pit mucous cells (PMCs), and common myeloid progenitors (CMPs). We verified the pharmacological effects of cimifugin on GC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. AKR1C2, MAOB, and PDE2A were identified as the key targets of cimifugin in GC-related metabolic reprogramming and pathogenesis. Our research provides preliminary insights into the potential therapeutic effects of cimifugin, which could be considered for future exploration in the context of GC treatment.",

However, its role in regulating inflammatory responses remains elusive. Here, we report that Vangl2 is upregulated in patients with sepsis and identify Vangl2 as a negative regulator of The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) signaling by regulating the protein stability and activation of the core transcription component p65. Mice with myeloid-specific deletion of Vangl2 (<i>Vangl2</i><sup>\u0394M</sup>) are hypersusceptible to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock. Vangl2-deficient myeloid cells exhibit enhanced phosphorylation and expression of p65, therefore, promoting the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines after LPS stimulation. Mechanistically, NF-\u03baB signaling-induced-Vangl2 recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase PDLIM2 to catalyze K63-linked ubiquitination on p65, which serves as a recognition signal for cargo receptor NDP52-mediated selective autophagic degradation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate Vangl2 as a suppressor of NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammation and provide insights into the crosstalk between autophagy and inflammatory diseases.",

Nonetheless, 5-azacitidine, which inhibits DNA methyltransferase activity, is not efficacious in BRAFV600E colorectal cancer in vivo. We randomized and treated mice implanted with patient-derived tumor xenografts harboring BRAFV600E mutation with control, 5-azacitidine, vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor), or the combination. Comprehensive epigenomic profiling was conducted on control and 5-azacitidine-treated tumor samples, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression. Combinations of epigenetic agents were explored in preclinical BRAFV600E colorectal cancer models. A profound reduction of DNA methylation levels upon 5-azacitidine treatment was confirmed, however, transcriptional repression was not relieved. This study unbiasedly explored the adaptive engagement of other epigenomic modifications upon 5-azacitidine treatment. A loss of histone acetylation and a gain of histone methylations, including H3K27 and H3K4 trimethylation, were observed around these hypomethylated regions, suggesting the involvement of polycomb repressive complex (PRC) activity around the genome with loss of DNA methylation, therefore maintaining the repression of key tumor-suppressor genes. Combined inhibition of PRC activity through EZH2 inhibition with 5-azacitidine treatment additively improved efficacies in BRAFV600E colorectal cancer cells. In conclusion, DNA hypomethylation by 5-azacitidine exhibits a close association with H3K27me3 and PRC activity in BRAFV600E colorectal cancer, and simultaneous blockade of DNA methyltransferase and EZH2 holds promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for patients with BRAFV600E-mutated colorectal cancer.",

          "abstract": "TP53 mutations are commonly observed in aggressive subtypes of breast cancer, influencing the tumor microenvironment (TME) and patient prognosis. In this study, we developed a prognostic gene-based risk model to stratify TP53-mutant breast cancer patients and explore potential therapeutic targets. We performed comprehensive bioinformatics analyses using TCGA and METABRIC datasets to identify key prognostic genes in TP53-mutant breast cancer. Differential expression and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed dysregulated pathways, while protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks highlighted functional hubs. Survival analysis, followed by univariate Cox regression, LASSO, and multivariate regression, led to the construction of a robust gene-based risk model. Immune landscape profiling was conducted to evaluate tumor microenvironment characteristics. Finally, drug sensitivity analysis and molecular docking were used to identify potential therapeutic agents targeting high-risk patients. TP53 mutations were present in\u00a0\u223c\u00a035\u00a0% of patients and associated with significant transcriptomic alterations. A total of 666 genes were consistently dysregulated, including 333 upregulated (such as A2ML1, CA9, VGLL1, PSAT1) and 333 downregulated (such as AGR3, TFF1, ESR1, CPB1) in TP53 mutated breast cancer patients. GSEA revealed that the cell cycle, DNA replication, and metabolic pathways in in TP53 mutated breast cancer patients. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of these genes revealed tightly connected modules related to mitotic regulation and immune signaling, underscoring key functional hubs in TP53-mutant tumors. A four-gene prognostic model (FGFR4, S100P, ADM, CTSC) stratified TP53-mutant patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct survival outcomes and immune profiles. High-risk patients exhibited a suppressed immune landscape, characterized by lower immune and stromal cell infiltration and higher tumor purity. Drug sensitivity analysis and molecular docking revealed several compounds, including Lapatinib, Docetaxel, and Trametinib, with strong binding affinities to key model genes. These drugs demonstrated potential efficacy in high-expression cells, suggesting their viability as targeted therapies. Our findings underscore the prognostic value of the identified genes and the immunosuppressive TME in TP53-mutant breast cancer. The identification of drug candidates with strong binding affinities to key proteins provides promising avenues for targeted therapy in this high-risk patient population.",

However, existing approaches are limited in discriminating among lipid categories, leaving a gap in our understanding of lipid-binding specificity. Recent advances in protein language models have opened new possibilities for discovering novel sequence insights. Here, we introduce PLiCat (Protein-Lipid interaction Categorization tool), a sequence-based framework designed to predict the categories of lipids that interact with proteins. PLiCat employs a hybrid deep learning architecture that integrates ESMC with BERT, enabling accurate and interpretable classification across eight major lipid categories. Through attribution analysis, PLiCat uncovers the sequence-encoded lipid-binding signatures and highlights residues contributing to binding specificity. Notably, PLiCat shows potential for identifying lipid-binding sites hidden in protein sequences. Furthermore, PLiCat can be used to assess the impact of pathogenic mutations on lipid-binding events. Collectively, PLiCat provides the first computational tool for lipid category prediction from protein sequence alone, offering valuable insights into lipid recognition mechanisms, and with promising applications in guiding rational protein design.

In this work, we hypothesized that a gene signature related to cell adhesion could predict breast cancer prognosis. Highly variant genes were tested for association with overall survival using Cox regression. Adhesion-related genes were identified through gene ontology analysis and multivariate Cox regression, with AIC selection, defined the prognostic signature. The <i>AdhesionScore</i> was then calculated as a weighted sum of gene expression, with risk stratification assessed by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests. We found that the <i>AdhesionScore</i> was a significant independent predictor of poor survival in three large independent datasets, as it provided a robust stratification of patient prognosis in the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) (HR: 2.65; 95% CI: 2.33-3.0, <i>p</i> = 2.34 \u00d7 10<sup>-51</sup>), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (HR: 3.46; 95% CI: 2.35-5.09, <i>p</i> = 3.50 \u00d7 10<sup>-10</sup>), and the GSE96058 (HR: 2.83; 95% CI: 2.20-3.65, <i>p</i> = 6.29 \u00d7 10<sup>-16</sup>) datasets. The 5-year risk of death in the high-risk group was 32.41% for METABRIC, 27.8% for TCGA, and 17.54% for GSE96058 datasets. Consistently, HER2-enriched and triple-negative breast carcinomas (TNBC) cases showed higher <i>AdhesionScores</i> than luminal subtypes, indicating an association with aggressive tumor biology. We have developed, for the first time, a molecular signature based on cell adhesion, as well as an associated <i>AdhesionScore</i> that can predict patient prognosis in invasive breast cancer, with potential clinical application.

We developed immunoprecipitation-coupled SNPs-seq (IP-SNPs-seq), enabling high-throughput, allele-specific, TF-resolved interrogation of candidate regulatory variants. Screening 903 prostate cancer-associated SNPs with androgen receptor (AR) immunoprecipitation, we identified multiple alleles with biased AR binding and convergent evidence from eQTL and ChIP-seq datasets. Among these, rs7600820 emerged as a functional enhancer variant: the risk G allele conferred stronger reporter activity, heightened AR responsiveness to dihydrotestosterone, and increased ODC1 expression; chromatin profiling and Hi-C revealed an active enhancer loop to the ODC1 promoter. ODC1 was consistently upregulated in primary and metastatic tumors across independent cohorts, associated with adverse clinicopathologic features, and required for prostate cancer cell proliferation. Gene-set enrichment analyses linked high ODC1 expression to MYC target signatures, positioning ODC1 as a clinically relevant, AR-regulated oncogenic node that integrates germline risk with core prostate cancer circuitry. IP-SNPs-seq thus provides a scalable route from association to mechanism, broadly applicable to diverse TFs and diseases, and nominates the AR-rs7600820-ODC1 axis as a potential biomarker and therapeutic vulnerability in androgen-driven prostate cancer.",

However, many datasets are limited in size, hindering the effective application of machine learning methods. We adopted a regularized network model coupled with the extended Bayesian information criterion to identify sub-networks and developed a graph network-based <i>k</i>-means clustering algorithm in connection with unbalanced optimal transport to group samples. Survival analysis and CIBERSORT analysis with tumor immune cell abundance were conducted between the identified sub-groups. This approach was applied to two cancer types: head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), using radiomic features extracted from computed tomography (CT) scans and RNA-Seq gene expression profiles. For HNSCC, high and low-risk groups were identified from the largest sub-network using the proposed method. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a statistically significant difference in progression-free survival between the high and low-risk groups (<i>p</i>\u202f=\u202f0.0202). In NSCLC, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a statistically significant difference in overall survival between the high and low-risk groups identified from the second largest sub-network (<i>p</i>\u202f=\u202f0.0007). The NSCLC radiomic data were assessed on the HNSCC network, validating statistical significance with <i>p</i>\u202f=\u202f0.0007. In CIBERSORT analysis for HNSCC, neutrophils showed a statistically significant difference between the high and low-risk groups (<i>p</i>\u202f=\u202f0.0221). In NSCLC, resting dendritic cells and activated mast cells showed statistically significant differences with <i>p</i>\u202f=\u202f0.0126 and 0.0046, respectively.

In this study, we performed a pan-cancer analysis to investigate the correlation between ENTPD6 expression and various factors, including prognosis, genetic alterations, epigenetic modification, immune infiltration, immunotherapy responses, functional enrichment, and drug sensitivity. A tissue microarray of gastrointestinal tumors was used to validate differential ENTPD6 protein expression. Pan-cancer analysis revealed that ENTPD6 expression was significantly elevated in many cancers. Immunohistochemistry staining analysis revealed that ENTPD6 expression was significantly higher in esophageal carcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, rectal adenocarcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared to normal tissues. Furthermore, ENTPD6 expression was strongly associated with immune-infiltrating cells, particularly clusters of differentiation 8+ T cells and natural killer cells, and correlated with immune-related genomic features including tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability. Pathway analysis indicated that ENTPD6 expression was primarily linked to purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways. Drug sensitivity analysis revealed that high ENTPD6 expression was sensitive to RDEA119, selumetinib, and PD-0325901.

It was evaluated using curated colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and cBioPortal, enriched with harmonized SDOH variables. Accuracy of natural language interpretation, run time efficiency, and usability were benchmarked against cBioPortal and UCSC Xena. AI-HOPE-PM successfully supported case-control stratification, survival modeling, and odds ratio analysis using natural language prompts. In colorectal cancer case studies, the system revealed significant disparities in progression-free survival and treatment access based on financial strain, health care access, food insecurity, and social support, demonstrating the importance of integrating SDOH in cancer research. Benchmark testing showed faster task execution compared to existing platforms, and the system achieved 92.5% accuracy in parsing biomedical queries. AI-HOPE-PM lowers technical barriers to integrative cancer research by enabling real-time, user-friendly exploration of clinical, genomic, and SDOH data. It expands on prior work by incorporating equity metrics into precision oncology workflows and offers a scalable tool for supporting disparities-focused translational research. Five videos are included as multimedia appendices to demonstrate platform functionality in real-world scenarios.",

          "abstract": "Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Extensive multi-omics analyses have revealed significant intratumoral heterogeneity even within the same histopathological subtype. However, a database that systematically integrates multi-omics data for lung cancer research has long been lacking. Here, we developed LOSTdb, a molecular subtype annotation system for lung cancer that integrates multi-omics data and metadata. LOSTdb comprises 295 multi-omics datasets, including bulk RNA-seq, genomic, proteomic, methylation, and scRNA-seq data, with over 10,000 manually curated metadata entries. This resource encompasses high-quality clinical specimens, mouse models, and cell lines, totaling 34,393 samples and more than 1.2\u00a0million single cells. Each omics sample was annotated with both literature-based classical subtypes and NMF-derived meta-program (MP) subtypes. The platform supports cross-searching of omics and metadata at the gene and dataset levels, offers multiple visualization and analysis methods, and includes five tool modules, enabling functions such as integrated analysis, significance analysis between metadata as well as between genes and metadata, and target prediction for lung cancer molecular subtypes, serving as an essential tool for lung cancer precision medicine. LOSTdb is a user-friendly interactive database freely accessible at http://lostdbcancer.com:8080 .",

Mapping this heterogeneity and understanding the unique contributions of each cell type to the tumour transcriptome is crucial for advancing cancer biology, yet high-throughput expression profiles from tumour tissues only represent combined signals from all cellular sources. Computational deconvolution of these mixed signals has emerged as a powerful approach to dissect both cellular composition and cell-type-specific expression patterns. Here, we provide a comprehensive guide to transcriptomic deconvolution, specifically tailored for cancer researchers, presenting a systematic framework for selecting and applying deconvolution methods, considering the unique complexities of tumour tissues, data availability and method assumptions. We detail 43 deconvolution methods and outline how different approaches serve distinctive applications in cancer research: from understanding tumour-immune surveillance to identifying cancer subtypes, discovering prognostic biomarkers and characterizing spatial tumour architecture. By examining the capabilities and limitations of these methods, we highlight emerging trends and future directions, particularly in addressing tumour cell plasticity and dynamic cell states.",

However, the high dimensionality and complexity of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data pose significant challenges in pan-cancer studies. This study hypothesizes that gene sets derived from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data will outperform those selected using bulk RNA-seq in pan-cancer downstream tasks. We analyzed scRNA-seq data from 181 tumor biopsies across 13 cancer types. High-dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis (hdWGCNA) was performed to identify relevant gene sets, which were further refined using XGBoost for feature selection. These gene sets were applied to downstream tasks using TCGA pan-cancer RNA-seq data and compared to six reference gene sets and oncogenes from OncoKB evaluated with deep learning models, including multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). The XGBoost-refined hdWGCNA gene set demonstrated higher performance in most tasks, including tumor mutation burden assessment, microsatellite instability classification, mutation prediction, cancer subtyping, and grading. In particular, genes such as DPM1, BAD, and FKBP4 emerged as important pan-cancer biomarkers, with DPM1 consistently significant across tasks. This study presents a robust approach for feature selection in cancer genomics by integrating scRNA-seq data and advanced analysis techniques, offering a promising avenue for improving predictive accuracy in cancer research.",

          "abstract": "Family with sequence similarity 72 (FAM72) is a protein-coding gene family located on chromosome 1 (chr1) in humans, and its functional roles, particularly in cancer, remain incompletely understood. Chimeric messenger RNA (mRNA) generated by intergenic mRNA trans-splicing (CRTS) is a novel phenomenon increasingly recognized for its involvement in cancer biology. It involves the fusion of two separate mRNA transcripts from different genomic loci, resulting in a chimeric mRNA molecule with altered functions. Since aging-related diseases, including various types of cancer, are major threats to our society, we investigated the functional significance of chimeric FAM72 fusion genes and their potential role in cancer cell proliferation with a focus on intergenic mRNA trans-splicing of FAM72 in cancer. We applied biocomputational analyses to identify chimeric FAM72 fusion genes across various cancer tissues. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of mRNA (RNA-seq) analysis were applied to identify novel chimeric FAM72 fusion genes at the genome (genomic structural variants or SVs) and/or mRNA level (trans-splicing). Our data supported the occurrence of novel chimeric adiponectin receptor-2 (ADIPOR2) :: FAM72B mRNA transcripts primarily produced through an intergenic mRNA trans-splicing event. Afterwards, we set up a breast cancer tissue-specific cell system to analyze the proliferative and migratory efficacy of cancer cells expressing these novel chimeric ADIPOR2::FAM72B mRNA fusion transcripts. Our findings suggest that the novel chimeric ADIPOR2::FAM72B mRNAs, generated by intergenic mRNA trans-splicing, can act as oncogenic drivers and represent promising diagnostic and therapeutic targets in breast cancer.",

          "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the role of epithelial cell transforming sequence 2 (ECT2) as a pan-cancer biomarker and to assess its potential as an immune-related target for cancer immunotherapy. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of ECT2 expression across 44 tumor types using large-scale transcriptomic datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Pan-cancer Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the correlation between ECT2 expression and patient survival outcomes. Functional assays, including ECT2 knockdown via shRNA in the HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line, were employed to investigate its mechanistic role. Transcriptomic profiling and pathway analyses were also conducted to explore the impact of ECT2 on cell proliferation and the tumor immune microenvironment. ECT2 was found to be significantly upregulated in 31 tumor types. Elevated ECT2 expression was consistently associated with worse overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), disease-free interval (DFI), and progression-free interval (PFI) across multiple cancer subtypes. Functional assays revealed that ECT2 knockdown significantly reduced HepG2 cell viability and impaired cell cycle progression, with downregulation of Cyclin D1. Transcriptomic analysis of ECT2-depleted cells indicated enriched gene sets related to cell proliferation and mitotic regulation. Additionally, ECT2 expression was significantly correlated with immune features, including immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint gene expression, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI). ECT2 is identified as a potential pan-cancer prognostic biomarker with dual roles in tumor initiation and progression, as well as in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment. Our findings suggest that ECT2 may serve as a promising therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy, warranting further investigation into its immune-regulatory and oncogenic functions.",

          "abstract": "While anticancer drug discovery has seen dramatic innovations and successes, sequential single therapies are time-limited by resistance, and combinatorial strategies have been lagging. The number of possible drug combinations is vast. To select drug combinations the oncologist requires knowledge of the optimal combination of proteins to co-target. Currently, combinations that the oncologist considers are primarily from empirical observations and clinical praxis. Our aim is to develop a signaling-based method to discover optimal proteins for the oncologist to co-target with drug combinations, and test it on available, patient-derived data. To temper the expected resistance to single drug regimen, we offer a concept-based stratified pipeline aimed at selecting co-targets for drug combinations. Our strategy is unique in its co-target selection being based on signaling pathways. This is significant since in cancer, drug resistance commonly bypasses blocked proteins by wielding alternative, or complementary, routes to execute cell proliferation. Our network-informed signaling-based approach harnesses advanced network concepts and metrics, and our compiled, tissue-specific co-existing mutations. Co-existing driver mutations are common in resistance. Thus, to mimic cancer and counter drug resistance scenarios, our pipeline seeks co-targets that when targeted by drug combinations, can shut off cancer's <i>modus operandi</i>. That is, its parallel or complementary signaling pathways would be blocked. Rotating through combinations could further lessen emerging resistance. We applied it to patient-derived breast and colorectal <i>ESR1</i>|<i>PIK3CA</i> and <i>BRAF</i>|<i>PIK3CA</i> subnetworks. Consistently, in breast cancer, our results suggest co-targeting proteins from the <i>ESR1|PIK3CA</i> subnetwork with an alpelisib-LJM716 combination. In colorectal cancer, they co-target <i>BRAF</i>|<i>PIK3CA</i> with alpelisib, cetuximab, and encorafenib combination. Collectively, our pipeline's results are promising, and validated by patient-based xenografts.",

Read count signals showed strong correlation with GC content, and applying locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS)-based GC bias correction effectively reduced false positives and improved CNA detection. The resulting cfDNA CNA profiles were reproducible within patients and showed strong concordance with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) tissue-level patterns for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC).

However, such data, often measured on small sample sizes, pose challenges to model-based clustering approaches such as Gaussian Mixture Models. Existing methods often fail to generalize due to model instability under complex mixture patterns. To overcome these limitations, we propose a natural-gradient variational inference framework for Gaussian mixture models named Praxis-BGM that incorporates informative priors-cluster-specific means, covariances, and structural connectivity-from large-scale reference data with known cluster or class labels to enable semi-supervised transfer learning. We derive natural-gradient updates that integrate prior knowledge, leveraging the Variational Online Newton algorithm. We also perform feature selection for clustering using Bayes Factors. Implemented using the JAX library for accelerator-oriented computation, Praxis-BGM is computationally efficient and scalable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Praxis-BGM in extensive simulations and with two real-world applications: bulk transcriptomic datasets for breast cancer subtyping (the Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Invasive Carcinoma and the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium), and transferring cell-type annotations between single-cell transcriptomic datasets produced by different single-cell RNA-seq technologies in a human pancreas study. Even when priors are partially mismatched with the target data, Praxis-BGM enhances semi-supervised clustering accuracy and biological interpretability.",

We previously reported a NSCLC case with EGFR mutations progressed on osimertinib therapy, revealing a novel NOTCH2-NTRK1 fusion gene in the plasma and tumor tissue. Although the NTRK gene fusion has been identified in NSCLC and a range of tumor types, the role of NOTCH2-NTRK1 in osimertinib resistance is unclear. We utilized both in vitro and in vivo models exhibiting NOTCH2-NTRK1 fusion positivity to explore the biological function of NOTCH2-NTRK1, as well as its role and mechanism in osimertinib resistance. The NOTCH2-NTRK1 fusion protein has been demonstrated to transform the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B and promote the proliferation of NSCLC cells both in vitro and in vivo. It induces osimertinib resistance by activating MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways. Phosphoproteomic analyses revealed a significant increase in the phosphorylation level of EGFR compared to the control group. Further investigations demonstrated that the NOTCH2-NTRK1 protein is capable of interacting with the EGFR protein. Protein molecular docking studies identified seven interacting sites between NOTCH2-NTRK1 and EGFR protein. Mutations within the region encompassing these seven interaction sites effectively reversed osimertinib resistance, leading to a significant reduction in the expression of key proteins within the MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways. Notably, the interaction between NOTCH2-NTRK1 and EGFR was maintained even with combined osimertinib and entrectinib treatment. Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which the NOTCH2-NTRK1 fusion confers resistance to osimertinib through its interaction with EGFR in NSCLC.",

Comprehensive multi-omics integration revealed transcriptional target genes of FRA1, with AXL, CDK6, and FSCN1 exhibiting increased expression in melanoma metastasis and a significant correlation with poor patient outcomes. Silencing AXL, CDK6, or FSCN1 abrogated FRA1-mediated invasion in vitro and reduced metastatic colonization.

Non-muscle invasive and muscle-invasive subtypes, especially for intermediate to high grade, carry a 25 - 50% progression-free survival rate, underscoring the need for high precision prognostic strategy. Urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) are promising carriers of tumor-derived RNAs and proteins. However, significant challenges in studying uEVs arise from the diverse cellular origin of uEVs associated with the dynamic composition of urine, which presents roadblocks for developing the clinical utility of uEVs. We introduced an AI-driven EV liquid biopsy pipeline that integrates (1) standardized EV isolation via NanoPom magnetic beads, (2) transcriptomic profiling for molecular subtyping, and (3) prognostic scoring algorithm. In a discovery cohort of 16 bladder cancer patients including both MIBC and NMIBC, we compared NanoPom isolated uEVs with ExoEasy and Fujifilm MagCapture isolated uEVs, for identifying bladder cancer subtype-specific gene signatures, and externally validated them using UCSC Xena. The result outperformed currently reported bladder cancer diagnostic biomarkers from assays including Galeas, CxBladder, and Xpert. In a validation cohort of matched 7 patient plasma samples, we confirmed with plasma derived EVs for correlating with urinary EV biomarkers from NGS sequencing. The prognostic score stratified patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-grade risk groups based on Xena's bladder cancer survival outcomes. Our AI-driven uEV liquid biopsy pipeline proves the concept for high precision bladder cancer subtyping and prognosis, which could potentially facilitate treatment decision and lead to advanced profiling of bladder tumor biology using uEV liquid biopsy.",

Inhibiting autophagy collapses podosomal-belts through macropinocytosis to accumulate vacuoles, lipid-droplets, nuclear Notch-1 (nNICD), DEPTOR, and HBV-polymerase mRNAs.

Furthermore, we CRISPR-engineered the antiviral chromosome-19 miRNA cluster (C19MC) to demonstrate that C19MC-miRNAs augment CEBPB, M<sup>on</sup>-gene-signature, ROS, and recapitulate CEBPB-driven phenotypes, in response to autophagy inhibition. Hemin, or a \u03b3-Secretase inhibitor counteract these phenotypes in CRISPR-C19MC-engineered cells. Therefore, a CEBPB and C19MC-driven M<sup>on</sup>-gene-signature regulates the podosomal belt, lipid droplet, HBV, and DEPTOR mRNA dynamics to genetically link obesity, and neurodegeneration at the cellular level.",

          "abstract": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by pseudohypoxic signaling as well as metabolic and epigenetic aberrations of increasing severity during its pathogenesis and progression. Upon identifying that the markedly lower expression of <i>L2HGDH</i> and <i>HIF1A</i> in ccRCC tumors is not explained only by 14q deletion (\u205340% of ccRCC), we sought to elucidate the mechanisms underscoring their down-regulation independent of 14q deletion, given the marked translational and scientific importance. While lower <i>L2HGDH</i> was found to portend a strikingly worse prognosis in a multivariate survival analysis of ccRCC patients (n=509; TCGA) highlighting its translational importance, the lower expression of <i>HIF1A</i> in ccRCC despite the upregulated HIF1\u03b1 protein (secondary to VHL loss) is of significant scientific interest. Using a comprehensive array of in vitro assays with genetic manipulation, clinicogenomic bioinformatic analyses of large ccRCC datasets, and the <i>Cdh16-</i>Cre <i>Vhl</i>-fl mouse model with kidney specific <i>Vhl</i>-loss, we demonstrate that the downregulation of both <i>L2HGDH</i> and <i>HIF1A</i> in ccRCC is driven by the hypoxia-inducible factors via miR21-3p and miR155-5p, respectively, during pathogenesis and progression. In doing so, we unveil a conserved inhibitory feedback loop for <i>HIF1A</i> in ccRCC (HIFs\u2192miR155\u2192<i>HIF1A</i>), providing a mechanistic explanation for <i>HIF1A</i> downregulation despite elevated HIF1\u03b1 protein. Furthermore, and most importantly, we show that inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factors reverses the adverse loss of <i>L2HGDH</i> and hydroxymethylcytosine in ccRCC, implicating both HIF2\u03b1 and HIF1\u03b1 in these metabolic-epigenetic aberrations.",

We developed OPTIC (Oncogene Panel Tester for Identifying Cancers), a pipeline employing a set cover algorithm, to identify the minimal set of genomic targets capturing the maximal proportion of tumours. Using three cohorts totalling 2,940 colorectal cancer samples, OPTIC was utilized to design a targeted sequencing panel spanning just 10,975 bases across APC, TP53, KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, CTNNB1, RNF43, and ACVR2A. Collectively, these loci contain pathogenic mutations in 96.3% of cases. Our pipeline enables compact panel design without compromising sample coverage.

Here, we show that a brain-specific serine/threonine protein kinase, BRSK2, a marker of aggressive metastatic disease in breast cancer patients, is crucial in regulating autophagy. BRSK2 is overexpressed in aggressive cancer and is associated with reduced disease-specific survival. BRSK2 also regulates basal autophagy and activates AKT, STAT3, and NF-\u03baB-mediated cancer cell survival pathways. In addition, BRSK2 overexpression increases the levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in breast cancer cells. Downregulation of BRSK2 using specific siRNAs or the BRSK2 kinase small-molecule inhibitor GW296115 markedly reduced nutrient-deprivation stress-mediated autophagy, cell growth, and metastatic potential, and enhanced breast cancer cell apoptosis. Endogenous BRSK2 is associated with the Vps34-class III PI3K-Beclin-1-ATG14 autophagy signaling complexes that could protect cancer cells from nutrient-deprivation stress. Our findings demonstrate the key role of the BRSK2-mediated protective autophagy and cell growth and survival under nutrient deprivation stress via survival signals, e.g., PI3K/AKT or STAT3-NF-kB, in aggressive breast cancer cells.",

We encompassed a comprehensive examination of the mechanistic features of ADSL and explored its viability as a broad-spectrum predictor for malignancies. Through a comprehensive pan-cancer examination, methylation assessment, immune infiltration evaluation, and further integration of single-cell transcriptome analysis, cellular communication, nomogram modeling, and prospective drug prediction in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we have undertaken a thorough investigation of the biological roles of ADSL in neoplasms, especially in HCC. ADSL is markedly overexpressed in neoplastic tissues. ADSL downregulation is significantly correlated with improved overall survival (OS) across diverse cancer types, particularly in HCC. Moreover, in a broad spectrum of cancer subtypes, there is a reduction in the promoter methylation levels of ADSL. In single-cell transcriptome analysis, compared to the ADSL low expression group, the interactions between HCC cells and other cells in the ADSL high expression group were significantly enhanced in both quantity and intensity, suggesting that the ADSL high expression group may have a more complex cell communication network, with key pathways related to tumor progression possibly being significantly activated. Subsequent drug prediction assessments revealed that ADSL is linked to multiple pharmaceuticals, including Thapsigargin, Doramapimod, Elesclomol, and PF\u2009-\u2009562271. ADSL holds potential as a promising prognostic marker for OS in various cancer types, particularly in HCC.

          "abstract": "B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is characterized by the malignant burgeoning of abnormal B-cell lymphoblasts. In recent years, the use of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy which targets CD19 antigen present on the surface of B-cells, has gained significant attention as a treatment option against aggressive and refractory forms of B-ALL. However, the loss of CD19 antigen on B-cell surface due to aberrant splicing under therapy pressure has been suggested as one of the main factors for the emerging CAR-T therapy resistance. The primary aim of this study was to elucidate the presence and characteristics of aberrant CD19 splicing patterns in pediatric B-ALL patients at the time of initial diagnosis stage. Herein, using RT-PCR based splice assays we have examined CD19 splicing patterns in 43 primary pediatric B-ALL patient samples spread across various subtypes, and investigated underlying mechanisms harboring aberrant splicing. We observe that CD19 isoform lacking exon 5-6 is present in ~ 55% of pediatric patients at the initial diagnosis stage itself. Our in-silico analysis identified splicing regulator MBNL1 as a potential modulator of CD19 exon 5-6 splicing. Subsequent qRT-PCR analysis in patient samples revealed that MBNL1 is overexpressed in patient samples exhibiting exon 5-6 skipping. Furthermore, our functional studies demonstrate that loss of MBNL1 in B-ALL cell line induces exon 5-6 skipping, thereby confirming its mechanistic role in CD19 splicing regulation. Taken together, we for the first time report the existence of aberrantly spliced CD19 isoform lacking exon 5-6 in primary pediatric patients at the diagnosis stage. Our results suggest that this MBNL1 dysregulation contributes to this splicing event, potentially predisposing patients to resistance against CD19-directed immunotherapies.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) remains one of the most prevalent and lethal malignancies worldwide, with its onset shaped by complex interactions between germline predispositions, environmental exposures, and accumulated somatic mutations. Accurate prediction of variant pathogenicity is essential for identifying high-risk individuals, guiding early detection, and tailoring treatment strategies. However, existing computational tools often lack disease-specific training and fail to generalize across diverse variant datasets. To address this gap, we systematically benchmarked the predictive utility of four distinct variant datasets using three Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks-TPOT, H2O AutoML, and MLJAR. Our goal was to evaluate how dataset composition influences classification performance and to identify the optimal dataset for BC-specific pathogenicity prediction. Among the datasets evaluated, Dataset-2-curated from both cancer-specific and non-cancer databases, consistently yielded the highest predictive performance across all frameworks. H2O AutoML achieved a peak accuracy of 99.99\u202f%, while TPOT and MLJAR also exhibited robust generalization on this dataset. Feature importance analyses revealed strong convergence across frameworks, highlighting conservation scores and pathogenicity metrics as dominant predictors. Interpretability techniques including SHAP, permutation importance, and LIME further validated the biological relevance and transparency of the models. This study presents a scalable, interpretable AutoML benchmarking framework tailored to the clinical prioritization of BC variants. By demonstrating the superiority of cancer-specific, disease-relevant datasets, our findings underscore the critical importance of thoughtful dataset design in machine learning pipelines for genomic medicine. Beyond BC, this framework is readily transferable to other genetic disorders, providing a foundational tool for precision diagnostics and the advancement of personalized oncology.",

Lipophagy-related genes (LRGs) are involved in the progression of GC, but their role in GC remains unclear. This study aims to develop and validate a lipophagy-related prognostic model to improve the predictive ability for GC prognosis. GC-related datasets from public databases were used, including The Cancer Genome Atlas-Stomach Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-STAD, training set), Gene Expression Omnibus 183904 (GSE183904, single-cell dataset), and GSE15459 (external validation set). LRGs were retrieved from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) using \"Lipophagy\" as the keyword. Differential expression analysis on TCGA-STAD identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis screened lipophagy-related module genes, overlapped with DEGs for candidate genes. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis identified key genes with causal relationships to GC. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses screened prognostic genes to construct and validate a risk model. Nomograms for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were built using significant clinical factors and risk scores. Immune and enrichment analyses compared high- and low-risk groups. Pseudotime processes of prognostic genes in cell clusters and inter-cluster communication were analyzed. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) verified prognostic gene expression. Thirty-five genes had causal relationships with GC; AKAP12, BST1, DCBLD1, PDK4, and SPART were selected as prognostic genes, mainly expressed in adipocytes, dendritic cells, and heart. A risk model and nomogram integrating risk scores and clinical features (age, gender, tumor stage) were constructed. Nomogram predicted values were consistent with observed ones. Survival curves in both sets showed significant differences (P<0.05). Area under the curve (AUC) values: TCGA-STAD (0.61 for 1 year, 0.64 for 3 years, 0.71 for 5 years); GSE15459 (0.67 for 1 year, 0.67 for 3 years, 0.69 for 5 years), indicating limited prognostic discrimination. AKAP12, BST1, DCBLD1, and PDK4 correlated positively with most immune cells. All 5 genes showed differential expression in fibroblasts between GC and normal samples and in pseudotime stages. Endothelial-intestinal epithelial cell interaction was enhanced in GC. RT-qPCR showed AKAP12, BST1, and DCBLD1 were up-regulated in GC samples. In this study, a risk model was constructed based on five prognostic genes (AKAP12, BST1, DCBLD1, PDK4, and SPART). A nomogram was established by integrating each patient's risk score and clinical features (age, gender, and tumor stage). This model exhibits preliminary prognostic discrimination ability in both the training set and the validation set; however, its predictive accuracy is limited and requires further optimization.",

At its core are degradation signals, or degrons, that initiate substrate engagement and ubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin ligases. Here we highlight how a variety of degradation signals promote substrate-E3 ligase interactions to orchestrate protein turnover with precision. While short linear motifs are frequently identified as degrons, an increasing number of degrons have recently been mapped to high-order protein structures, underscoring the architectural diversity and cryptic nature of degradation signals. Furthermore, nonproteinaceous signals beyond degrons often facilitate the precise control of protein ubiquitination. These additional signals can reside within substrates and E3 ligases or at their interfaces. Finally, we discuss how dysregulation of degrons and degradation signals is linked to human diseases. A deeper mechanistic understanding of degradation signals will guide new therapeutic strategies, whether by restoring defective protein ubiquitination or by harnessing targeted protein degradation.",

In this study, we demonstrated that TIE1 expression correlates with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients and is highly elevated in the Claudin-low subtype, which largely overlaps with TNBC. Notably, TIE1 expression promoted tumorigenicity in a breast cancer cell line. Furthermore, in primary tumors formed by TIE1-expressing cells, we observed TIE1 cleavage, reduced apoptosis, and activation of the AKT-p70S6K signaling pathway.

Furthermore, RT-qPCR, immunohistochemical staining, western blot, CCK8 assay, and wound healing assay were employed to validate the involvement of YY2 in ESCA pathogenesis. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that the YY2 gene is upregulated in ESCA tissues, with its high expression significantly associated with poor prognosis and elevated levels of M2 macrophages, NK cells, Tregs, CTLA4, TIGIT, and Siglec-15. Validating the ESCA samples demonstrated that knockdown of YY2 effectively inhibited cell proliferation and migration in ESCA cells. The biological functions of YY2 and its co-expressed genes were primarily associated with transcriptional regulation, DNA methylation, glycometabolism, and ubiquitination. Moreover, the regulatory network of YY2 in the glycolysis pathway was found to involve multiple genes and miRNAs. Finally, a prognostic model based on YY2 and its associated glycolysis genes revealed a strong inverse correlation between higher risk scores and lower survival rates in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).

          "abstract": "Necroptosis is a form of lytic cell death that is overactivated during infections and in inflammatory pathologies<sup>1</sup>. NINJ1 was recently found to be a mediator of plasma membrane rupture (PMR) during pyroptosis, toxin-induced necrosis, apoptosis, and ferroptosis<sup>2,3</sup>, but the mediator of PMR during necroptotic cell death remained unknown. Here, using a CRISPR-Cas9-based genome-wide knockout approach, we identify SIGLEC12 as a key mediator of necroptosis downstream of MLKL at the PMR step. Cells with knockdown or knockout of SIGLEC12 are defective in necroptosis-induced PMR and demonstrate ballooning morphology. During necroptosis, SIGLEC12 undergoes dephosphorylation, interacts with MLKL, forms cytosolic puncta and assembles into fibrils. Notably, SIGLEC12 is cleaved by TMPRSS4 during necroptosis to produce a 20-kDa fragment highly homologous to NINJ1, and this cleavage event is required and sufficient to induce PMR during necroptosis. A SIGLEC12 variant associated with cancer (Ser458Phe) and a variant found in the general human population (Arg528Trp) attenuate SIGLEC12 cleavage by TMPRSS4. Knockout of Siglec12 in mouse cells does not affect PMR, suggesting a species-specific role. Our identification of SIGLEC12 as a mediator of PMR expands our understanding of how programmed necrosis is executed and offers new approaches for targeting this proinflammatory form of cell death in human diseases.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, computational methods have emerged that calculate enrichment of gene signatures within individual samples. These signatures offer critical insights into the coordinated activity of functionally related genes, proteins or metabolites, enabling the identification of unique molecular profiles in individual cells and patients. This strategy is pivotal for patient stratification and advancement of personalized medicine. However, the rise of large-scale datasets, including single-cell profiles and population biobanks, has exposed significant computational inefficiencies in existing methods. Current methods often demand excessive runtime and memory resources, becoming impractical for large datasets. Overcoming these limitations is a focus of current efforts by bioinformatics teams in academia and the pharmaceutical industry, as essential to support basic and clinical biomedical research. To address this critical need, we developed PLAID (Pathway Level Average Intensity Detection), an ultrafast and memory optimized single sample gene set enrichment algorithm that utilizes sparse matrix computation. PLAID delivers highly accurate gene set scoring and surpasses the performance of current methods in single-cell and bulk transcriptomics, and proteomics data. PLAID uniquely integrates the most widely used gene set scoring algorithms, enabling researchers to apply multiple methods for cross-validation with outstanding runtime efficiency and minimal memory requirement. PLAID is implemented in the R language for statistical computing. PLAID source code and installation instructions are available with no restrictions at https://github.com/bigomics/plaid.",

          "abstract": "Site-directed mutagenesis is a basic molecular tool required for protein, RNA and plasmid engineering. For mutagenesis methods, an ideal goal is to reach the efficiency of 100%. Towards this goal, we have recently taken the first step by adopting an innovative strategy using primer pairs with 3'-overhangs, thereby developing P3 site-directed mutagenesis, with an average efficiency of ~50%. As the second step towards the ideal goal, we report here P3a site-directed mutagenesis with an efficiency reaching ~100%. We systematically evaluated this new method by engineering >100 point mutations and small deletions (or insertions) on >20 mammalian expression vectors encoding various epigenetic regulators and the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. As all known mutagenesis methods are limited to point mutations and small deletions/insertions (up to a dozen nucleotides), a technical problem is how to carry out cassette mutagenesis for replacement, deletion or insertion of large DNA fragments. The high efficiency of P3a mutagenesis and the 'handshaking' feature of primer pairs with 3'-overhangs inspired us to adapt this new method for seamless cassette mutagenesis, including highly efficient epitope tagging and untagging, deletion of small or large DNA fragments (up to 5 kb) and insertion of gene fragments (up to ~0.4 kb), LoxP sites and sequences encoding degrons, sgRNA and tigRNA. Thus, this new site-specific and cassette mutagenesis method is highly efficient, fast and versatile, likely resulting in its wide use for typical biomedical research, as well as for engineering and refining synthetic or mutant proteins from AI-assisted design.",

          "abstract": "SF3B1 mutations are among the most common splicing factor mutations in myeloid malignancies, yet the mechanisms linking aberrant splicing to metabolic phenotypes remain incompletely understood. We previously demonstrated that SF3B1 mutations cause nonsense-mediated decay of BRD9, a core component of the non-canonical BAF chromatin remodeling complex. Here, we investigated how the SF3B1-BRD9 pathway contributes to metabolic reprogramming in hematopoietic cells. Using BRD9-depleted murine models and analyses of SF3B1-mutated samples, we found that BRD9 depletion markedly upregulates ALOX5, which plays a key role in lipid peroxidation, particularly by oxidizing polyunsaturated fatty acids. BRD9 and ALOX5 expressions are negatively correlated, and the presence of SF3B1 mutations is associated with ALOX5 upregulation in AML datasets. Notably, transcriptomic analysis demonstrated preferential upregulation of ALOX5 in mature myeloid lineages rather than stem/progenitor fractions. Mechanistically, integrated RNA-seq/ChIP-seq and Hi-C analyses revealed that BRD9 loss enhances CTCF occupancy at the ALOX5 locus boundary, enabling aberrant chromatin loop formation that drives transcriptional activation. These events increase lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis susceptibility in hematopoietic cells as evidenced by enhanced BODIPY-C11 oxidation and erastin sensitivity. Our findings reveal a spliceosome-to-chromatin-to-metabolism pathway in which SF3B1 mutations promote ferroptosis through BRD9-mediated chromatin dysregulation, highlighting the previously unrecognized metabolic rewiring in myeloid malignancies.",

Therefore, this study performs a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of ZNF367 for its diagnostic and prognostic value and underlying biological mechanisms across multiple cancer types. Multi-omics data from the website databases were utilized for analyzing the pan-cancer expression landscape of ZNF367 and its potential diagnostic and prognostic significance, and validating its expression in some cancers by immunohistochemistry, followed by a series of biological analyses using online bioinformatics tools to investigate the underlying mechanisms, including the genetic and epigenetic alterations of the ZNF367 gene, interaction networks of ZNF367 with proteins and genes, associations of ZNF367 with tumor genetic heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment characteristics. ZNF367 expression levels were elevated in the majority of cancers, validated its overexpression of protein in some cancers, and showed moderate to high diagnostic performance in 26 cancer types. Overexpression of ZNF367 was connected with unfavorable prognostic outcomes across several malignancies and acted as an independent risk factor using multivariate Cox regression analysis in some tumors. Common genetic alterations of ZNF367 included mutations and amplifications. KEGG functional analysis uncovered that ZNF367-associated genes participated in multiple cancer-related pathways. Significant correlations were observed between ZNF367 and tumor genetic heterogeneity, DNA methylation, immune infiltration and ZNF367-related genes in most cancers.

REP occurs in approximately 50% of glioblastoma and is associated with worse overall survival. Despite the increasing trend towards molecular characterization of glioblastoma, no analysis has been performed between molecular alterations in glioblastoma and REP that may help define the urgency of adjuvant therapy. A retrospective review of 100 consecutive glioblastoma patients who underwent gross or subtotal resection followed by next generation sequencing and radiation therapy (RT). REP was defined as increased nodular enhancement at the resection cavity border between postoperative and RT planning MRI. Next generation sequencing identified alterations in the following genes in at least 10% of patients: TERT promoter, EGFR, PTEN, TP53, CDKN2A/2B, NF1, MTAP, PIK3CA. In addition to MGMT methylation status and patient characteristics, these were tested for correlation with REP and overall survival. REP was observed in 45 patients. On univariate analysis, EGFR alterations (p\u2009=\u20090.001) and MGMT methylation (p\u2009=\u20090.016) were significantly associated with REP. On multivariate analysis, only EGFR alterations (p\u2009=\u20090.006) remained associated with REP. No correlations were identified with overall survival and REP, EGFR, or MGMT methylation. Of note, there were statistically significant correlations between overall survival and NF1, TERT, MGMT methylation, and degree of resection. This study identifies EGFR alterations as a significant predictor of REP in glioblastoma. Patients with these alterations identified post-operatively may benefit from expedited adjuvant therapy to mitigate early tumor progression. Further research is needed to refine treatment strategies for this high-risk subset.",

IQCE, a ciliary scaffold protein, has poorly defined roles in cancer. Its clinical significance, molecular mechanisms, and impact on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and therapy response are largely unknown. We conducted a comprehensive pan-cancer multi-omics analysis of IQCE using genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, spatial transcriptomic, single-cell transcriptomic, and pharmacogenomic datasets. Analyses included differential expression, survival, pathway enrichment, immune deconvolution, cellular localization, and drug sensitivity prediction. IQCE was significantly upregulated in multiple solid tumors, most notably cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and glioblastoma (GBM), demonstrating strong diagnostic value. High IQCE independently predicted poor prognosis in SKCM. Mechanistically, elevated IQCE correlated with suppression of immune pathways (e.g., cytokine signaling), inhibition of apoptosis, and activation of RAS/MAPK/RTK oncogenic signaling. Single-cell and spatial analyses confirmed IQCE enrichment specifically within malignant cells. High IQCE was associated with broad chemoresistance. Pharmacogenomic profiling revealed a consistent inverse correlation between IQCE expression and sensitivity to the p53-reactivating compound RITA. IQCE emerges as a novel oncogene-associated biomarker with significant diagnostic and prognostic utility, particularly in SKCM. It promotes an immunosuppressive TME and oncogenic signaling while being localized to malignant cells. Although associated with chemoresistance, the vulnerability of IQCE-high tumors to RITA offers a promising therapeutic strategy. IQCE represents a compelling target for precision oncology.",

However, a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis integrating genomic data is still lacking. This study employed an integrated approach using data from multiple cancer genomics databases to assess ECT2 across various malignancies. Expression profiles of ECT2 were analyzed for differential expression across tumor stages and its association with clinical outcomes. Correlation analyses examined the relationship between ECT2 expression and immune cell infiltration levels. Pathway enrichment analysis identified biological processes influenced by ECT2 dysregulation in cancer progression. These methods facilitated a comprehensive exploration of ECT2's role in cancer biology, revealing potential implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Analysis across 33 tumor types consistently shows elevated ECT2 expression. ECT2 correlates with tumor staging in 8 cancers and molecular subtypes in 13 cancers, and shows associations with immune subtypes in 22 cancers, suggesting its role in cancer progression and immune modulation. ECT2 demonstrates strong diagnostic potential (the area under the ROC curve\u2005>\u20050.9) in 16 cancers and correlates with poorer overall survival in 11 cancers. ECT2 expression correlates positively with microsatellite instability in STAD, MESO, UCEC, and READ, and negatively in DLBC; it correlates positively with tumor mutational burden in STAD, PAAD, ACC, LGG, and LUAD, and negatively in THYM. ECT2 also exhibits diverse correlations with immune checkpoint genes and specific immune cell types identified through CIBERSORT analysis. ECT2 interacts with proteins like RACGAP1, KIF23, enriched in pathways involving cell polarity, Ras signaling, and tight junctions, impacting cancer progression and stemness in various cancer types. This study offers comprehensive insights into ECT2's role in cancer biology through integrative bioinformatics analyses. The results advocate for ECT2 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in diverse malignancies, suggesting avenues for personalized oncology strategies.",

Defective DNA mismatch repair mechanisms in these tumors lead to the accumulation of insertion-deletion mutations, a hypermutated phenotype, and abundant tumor-specific neoantigens. These features drive robust T cell responses, explaining the remarkable sensitivity of dMMR/MSI-H tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Emerging evidence from clinical trials across resectable dMMR/MSI-H colorectal, gastric and gastroesophageal junction, and other solid tumors indicate that ICI therapy can induce profound pathological responses, including high rates of pathological complete response. These responses may permit organ preservation and reduce treatment-associated morbidity, offering a compelling alternative to conventional surgery-based approaches. Despite this promise, several challenges remain. Critical areas warranting further investigation include the refinement of patient selection strategies, clarification of the role of surgery in patients achieving a clinical complete response, and the identification of reliable predictive biomarkers for therapeutic response and resistance. In addition, the long-term oncologic outcomes associated with non-operative management remain to be elucidated. This review comprehensively summarizes the biological basis and emerging clinical evidence for immunotherapy in resectable dMMR/MSI-H solid tumors.

These mutation-derived cancer-specific peptides are defined as \"neo-peptides\". Neo-peptides eliciting immune responses, i.e. immunogenic neo-peptides, are defined as \"neo-epitopes\". Given their relevance to cancer immunotherapy, we conducted a meta-analysis to examine how experimental evidence informs our understanding of neo-epitopes. Our study is the largest reported to date. Using the cancer epitope database and analysis resource (CEDAR), we analyzed over 16,000 neo-peptides tested in more than 20,000\u00a0T cell assays across 180 studies. We found that validated neo-epitope frequencies varied across cancer types, with the highest rates in skin and lung and the lowest in colorectal cancer. Neo-epitopes were enriched in driver genes such as TP53 and KRAS. However, testing frequency correlated with mutation prevalence, revealing bias toward recurrent mutations. Despite the high sequence similarity among RAS family members, validated neo-epitope overlap was minimal, challenging pan-RAS strategies. Shared neo-epitopes across cancer types are rare, with only 16 validated in more than one cancer type. While most assays involved HLA class I, class II alleles presented a higher proportion of validated neo-epitopes. Specific alleles, including HLA-B*40:01 and HLA-DRB1*11:01, were enriched for neo-epitopes, whereas others, like HLA-A*02:01, were enriched for non-immunogenic neo-peptides. Finally, amino acid substitutions that altered hydrophobicity or charge were more common in neo-epitopes. Together, these findings define key features of neo-epitopes, expose methodological and biological biases in the literature, and highlight opportunities to improve the selection and prioritization of neo-epitopes for cancer immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) process is recognized as the quality control of mRNAs to maintain their integrity and production of functional proteins. Readthrough of aberrant mRNA containing premature termination codons (PTCs) can induce the production of truncated proteins with negative functionalities. To elucidate the structural and mechanistic basis of NMD components, we performed molecular dynamic simulations (MDS) to analyze their dynamic behavior across different stages of the process. We further investigated how cancer-associated mutations alter mRNA-binding protein (RBP) interactions within the NMD machinery. Over the simulation time, the mRNA containing PTCs underwent significant conformational rearrangements, ultimately forming stable interactions with the eukaryotic class-I release factor (eRF1). The efficiency of eRF1 in recognizing stop codons (UAG, UGA, or UAA) nitrogenous bases was identified, revealing a stronger preference toward UAA. Due to the lower structural stability, the AU-rich mRNA motifs showed a diminished eRF1 binding affinity relative to other PTC-containing transcripts. Among the studied cancer variants, the D9Y, R10S, F56V, P89L, and I62M residues were found to either enhance or disrupt eRF1-mRNA interactions. Similarly, when evaluating EIF4A3 RBP from the exon junction complex (EJC), the P114L and G309A mutations significantly impaired the protein-mRNA binding affinity. Surface residue mapping of SMG1 kinase revealed that it engages with SMG8, SMG9, and UPF1 in a sequential binding order, displaying the highest affinity for SMG8. Overall, these findings contribute to the mechanistic understanding of molecular properties for different RBPs from the NMD process, which can be the basis of developing new therapeutic strategies against genetic disease or cancer.",

To address the need for precise analysis of large datasets, we developed THRESHOLD, a novel tool that introduces the concept of gene saturation. Unlike traditional methods focused on absolute or binary expression levels, THRESHOLD quantifies the consistency of gene expression across patients, revealing co-regulation patterns critical for understanding disease mechanisms and stratifying patients by molecular signatures. The tool offers several features, including user-defined parameters, statistical comparisons, and interactive data visualization. THRESHOLD has uncovered compelling insights into disease progression using TCGA cancer datasets. For instance, bladder urothelial carcinoma demonstrated increasing upregulated gene saturation in progressive cancer stages (<i>P</i>\u00a0< .00001). Moreover, THRESHOLD identified heightened gene saturation in patients with earlier onset of prostate adenocarcinoma (<i>P</i>\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) and revealed a critical fusion transcript, SLC45A2-AMACR, implicated in prostate adenocarcinoma progression, recurrence, and metastasis. Additionally, novel biomarkers and potential candidates for drug therapies were identified through protein-protein interaction networks and functional analyses of saturation data in colon adenocarcinoma and breast invasive carcinoma. THRESHOLD offers a new approach for studying gene expression dynamics and patient stratification. The tool is publicly available at Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/15287195.",

In our current study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of ADAM12 expression, diagnosis, prognosis, genomic variations, DNA methylation, functional enrichment, immune infiltration as well as immunotherapy in pan-cancer utilizing public datasets. Additionally, a series of biological functional experiments of ADAM12 were performed in gastric cancer cells including cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation, wound healing analysis, and Transwell analyses. ADAM12 expression was prominently elevated and correlated with unfavorable prognosis in most cancer types. It exhibited elevated mutation frequency and a negative correlation with DNA methylation promoters across various tumors. ADAM12 expression strongly linked to ESTIMATE, immune/stromal scores, immune checkpoint genes, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI) in specific cancer types. Single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing analysis revealed heightened ADAM12 levels in fibroblasts, highlighting its importance in tumor immunity. Furthermore, the predictive value of immunotherapy surpassed that of tumor mutational burden based on TIDE. Functional enrichment analysis associated ADAM12 with focal adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling, and ECM-receptor interactions. In vitro experiments confirmed that ADAM12 downregulation significantly impeded proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells. ADAM12 might be a valuable prognostic biomarker and a promising candidate for tumor immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a major global health challenge. Inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequent driver event in this malignancy. p53 inactivation occurs either through TP53 mutations in human papilloma virus (HPV)-negative cases or via HPV-mediated p53 degradation in HPV-positive (HPV+) cases, where most tumors retain a wild-type (WT) TP53 allele. This underscores the critical role ofp53-regulated processes in HNSCC pathogenesis. Clinically, HPV+ HNSCC has significantly better outcomes than HPV-negative disease. However, approximately 10% of HPV+ HNSCC tumors harbor TP53 mutations, suggesting selective pressure to suppress p53 signaling beyond viral degradation. In this study, we demonstrate that HPV+ TP53-WTHNSCC cells have residual, tumor suppressive p53 activity. Clinically, patients with HPV+ TP53-WT tumors exhibit significantly better survival than those with HPV+ TP53-mutantor HPV-negative tumors. In vitro, WT p53 loss in HPV+ HNSCC cells enhances proliferation, migration, and invasion, and transcriptomic analysis confirms ongoing p53-dependent gene regulation. HPV+ TP53-WT tumors also display tumor-suppressive gene methylation patterns, fewer chromosomal alterations, and reduced PI3K-AKT signaling compared to TP53-mutant HPV+ cases. Notably, p53 loss increases expression of the PI3K catalytic subunit p110\u03b1, suppresses the PI3K-AKT inhibitor INPP5D, and sensitizes cells to pharmacologic PI3Kinhibition. Together, our findings challenge the prevailing view that p53 is completely inactivated in HPV+ HNSCC and reveal tumor suppressive, p53-driven mechanisms that persist in these tumors. These insights highlight a potential role for TP53-based stratification in guiding treatment decisions and suggest new therapeutic vulnerabilities in HPV+ HNSCC.",

          "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is called \u201cthe king of cancer\u201d because of its high degree of malignancy, poor prognosis, and lack of effective treatment. It encompasses multiple subtypes, with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) representing its most prevalent form. An increasing number of studies have shown that tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) is associated with the proliferation, migration, and invasion capabilities of various cancers. However, the mechanism of TRIM21 function in pancreatic cancer remains to be further studied.This study explored the mechanisms of TRIM21 in pancreatic cancer through bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments and assessed its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. Using the GEPIA 2 platform, which incorporates TCGA, GTEx, and CPTAC datasets along with GEO data, we analyzed the expression levels of TRIM21 mRNA or protein across pan-cancer and specifically in PAAD. The HPA database was utilized to examine differential TRIM21 protein expression between PAAD patient samples and normal tissues, while Western blotting was employed to assess differences in TRIM21 expression between pancreatic cancer cell lines and normal cells. TIMER 2.0 was applied to investigate the correlation between TRIM21 expression and clinical parameters, and the Kaplan-Meier plotter was used to evaluate its prognostic significance. The cBioPortal database was leveraged to analyze the relationship between TRIM21 and immune infiltration in PAAD. The impact of TRIM21 on PAAD cell viability, proliferation, and migration was assessed through colony formation, CCK-8, and wound healing assays, respectively. Flow cytometry was used to measure apoptosis rates and cell cycle distribution. Associations between TRIM21 and pathway genes or proteins in PAAD patients were determined using either TIMER 2.0 or Western blot analysis. Analysis of GEPIA 2 and GEO datasets revealed that TRIM21 expression is significantly higher in pancreatic cancer tissues compared to non-tumor tissues. Consistent findings were obtained from immunohistochemical data in the HPA database. Examination of the cBioPortal database indicated that TRIM21 is associated with immune infiltration in PAAD. When TRIM21 was specifically knocked down using siRNA in PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells, cell viability, proliferation, colony formation, and migration were reduced compared to negative control cells, while apoptosis was significantly increased. TRIM21 knockdown induced noticeable cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and decreased Cyclin D1 expression. Furthermore, analysis via TIMER 2.0 demonstrated a strong correlation between TRIM21 and the expression of genes related to the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in PAAD patients. Western blot analysis showed that Wnt3a and \u03b2-catenin expression decreased in the knockdown group compared to the NC group. Additionally, GSK3\u03b2 expression was increased, while c-Myc expression was reduced. TRIM21 knockdown reduced PANC-1 cell proliferation and migration, induced apoptosis, and affected cell cycle progression. Moreover, TRIM21 knockdown may affect cell growth by influencing the expression of proteins related to the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Therefore, TRIM21 is expected to be a biomarker for the prognosis evaluation of pancreatic cancer and a potential therapeutic target.

This study aims to assess the expression profiles of <i>B3GNT3</i> in different types of cancers and its potential clinical significance through a pan-cancer analysis. Public data were derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program and The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) website. Data analysis relied on algorithms provided by websites designed for different functional purposes. We performed expression analysis, correlation analysis with pathological staging, survival analysis, and co-expression gene correlation analysis of <i>B3GNT3</i> using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2.0 (GEPIA2.0). We analyzed the expression of <i>B3GNT3</i> and its correlation with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) infiltration using Tumor Immune Response Estimation and Analysis 2.0 (TIMER2.0). The expression of <i>B3GNT3</i> in various human tissues was investigated using the Human Protein Atlas (HPA). Protein expression levels of <i>B3GNT3</i> in tumors were analyzed using University of Alabama Cancer Database (UALCAN). The mutation frequency and types of <i>B3GNT3</i> were examined using the cBioPortal platform. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was conducted using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database. Expression of <i>B3GNT3</i> in real-world cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV) from The Eighth Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University (The First People's Hospital of Shunde, Foshan) were validated using immunohistochemistry between tumour and normal tissues. <i>B3GNT3</i> expression was significantly different in 18 cancer tissues compared to corresponding normal tissues, with 15 showing significant upregulation and three showing significant downregulation. Patients with <i>B3GNT3</i> gene alterations exhibited significant changes in overall survival (OS) across five cancer types and in disease-free survival (DFS) across four cancer types. The expression of <i>B3GNT3</i> was significantly consistent with CAFs levels in four algorithms across ten cancer types.

This study aims to comprehensively evaluate ABAT's pan-cancer landscape-including gene expression, diagnostic-prognostic value, epigenetic modifications, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity-and validate its functional role in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Using multi-omics data from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), HPA (Human Protein Atlas), UALCAN (University of Alabama at Birmingham Library Cancer Analysis Portal), TIMER2.0 (Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource 2.0), and other databases, we conducted bioinformatics analyses to characterize ABAT across 33 cancer types. In vitro validation involved quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and transwell assays to assess ABAT expression, migration, and invasion in LUAD tissues and cell lines. ABAT was significantly underexpressed in 11 cancers [e.g., kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), LUAD] and overexpressed in [breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA)/pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PCPG)], with expression correlating with tumor staging (e.g., stage III LUAD). It exhibited high diagnostic accuracy [area under curve (AUC) >0.8] in 5 cancers [cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), kidney chromophobe carcinoma (KICH)] and predicted poor prognosis in KIRC, LUAD, etc. Promoter hypermethylation negatively correlated with ABAT expression in most cancers. ABAT associated with CD8<sup>+</sup>/CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration, 17 immune checkpoints (e.g., ADO, CD160), and differential drug sensitivity (e.g., afatinib sensitivity in ABAT-high cells). In LUAD, ABAT overexpression inhibited cell migration and invasion. ABAT shows expression heterogeneity in pan-cancer, linking to diagnosis, prognosis, immune microenvironment, and drug response. Its tumor-suppressive role in LUAD highlights ABAT as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for precision oncology, warranting further clinical validation.",

Upregulation and copy number amplification of LINC00592 were observed in LUAD and were found to be positively correlated with pathological stage, overall survival, progression-free survival, disease-specific survival, first-progression-free survival, and post-progression survival in LUAD patients. Silencing of LINC00592 impeded the ability of LUAD cells to migrate, invade, and form colonies, due to its ability to regulate the expression of NTN1, an important adhesion-related molecule. LINC00592 is a prognostic marker in LUAD patients and may represent a promising target for therapeutic intervention in this type of cancer.",

          "abstract": "Thyroid cancer remains one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide, with lymph node metastasis (LNM) playing a critical role in determining patient prognosis and treatment. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and have been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This study aimed to identify miRNAs involved in the lymph node metastatic process in thyroid cancer and to evaluate their potential as therapeutic targets. RNA-seq datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used to identify dysregulated miRNAs in LNM from papillary and medullary thyroid carcinoma (PTC and MTC). The candidate miRNAs were transfected in thyroid carcinoma cell lines, TPC-1 and BCPAP, followed by quantification of target genes and analysis of cell migration and invasion assays in vitro. Three miRNAs miR-199a-5p, miR-199a-3p, and miR-148a-5p were identified as downregulated in thyroid cancer with LNM. Transfection of TPC-1 and BCPAP cells with mimetics reduced cell migration and invasion. Additionally, these miRNAs modulated the expression of EMT-related genes, particularly in BCPAP cells. Our results indicate that miR-199a-3p, miR-199a-5p, and miR-148a-5p are involved in key metastatic processes, suggesting their relevance as potential biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for thyroid tumors. Further in vivo validation and clinical studies are required to explore their translational applications.",

          "abstract": "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for approximately 85% of cases. Accurate differentiation between adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is critical for informing personalized therapies. Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and p40 are traditionally regarded as mutually exclusive markers of ADC and SCC, respectively. However, a subset of tumors exhibits co-expression of TTF-1 and p40, presenting diagnostic challenges and suggesting underlying biological distinctiveness. This study aimed to characterize the clinicopathological, molecular, and immunohistochemical features of NSCLCs co-expressing TTF-1 and p40, in order to clarify their biological and clinical significance. A retrospective analysis was performed on NSCLC cases diagnosed at the Central Clinical Hospital of the Medical University of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a between May 2021 and November 2022. Clinicopathological and survival data were collected. Tumors co-expressing TTF-1 and p40 underwent immunohistochemical evaluation and RNA/DNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS). Of 94 NSCLC cases analyzed, 18 (19.1%) demonstrated co-expression of TTF-1 and p40. These tumors were significantly more likely to exhibit solid growth patterns compared to control cases (P=0.03), but no significant difference in overall survival (OS) was observed (P=0.46). Among 17 samples subjected to NGS, genetic alterations were identified in 15 (88.2%) cases, with <i>TP53</i> mutations in 11 (64.7%), <i>KRAS</i> in 4 (23.5%), <i>FGFR1-3</i> in 4 (23.5%) and EGFR in 2 (11.8%) cases. Immunohistochemical analysis of 18 tumors revealed strong p63 and p53 expression in 11 (61.1%) and 13 (72.2%) cases, respectively. FGFR4 protein was abundantly expressed in 15 cases (83.3%, H-score >150), while elevated H-scores for FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 were observed in 10 (55.6%), 7 (38.9%), and 2 (11.1%) cases, respectively. NSCLCs co-expressing TTF-1 and p40 appear to represent a biologically distinct and poorly differentiated subgroup, frequently associated with <i>TP53</i> mutations and FGFR pathway alterations. These tumors may arise from basal reserve cells and undergo <i>TP53</i>-driven reprogramming, diverging from the classical pathways of ADC and SCC. Accordingly, they may be more appropriately classified as NSCLC, not otherwise specified (NOS), rather than strictly as ADC or SCC. Given their molecular complexity, broader genomic profiling may be warranted in these cases, even though current guidelines do not recommend routine molecular testing for SCC.",

This exploratory study aims to characterize somatic mutations and disrupted signaling pathways in Saudi Arabian CRC patients. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on tumor DNA from 24 Saudi CRC patients. Somatic variants were identified and analyzed in a curated panel of cancer-related genes. Comparative analysis was conducted against The Cancer Genome Atlas colorectal cancer dataset (TCGA-COADREAD), and pathway enrichment analysis was performed. Somatic variants were identified in 23 tumors, with recurrent mutations in <i>BRCA2</i> (61%), <i>TCF7L2</i> (52%), <i>EGFR</i> (43%), and <i>SOS1</i> (43%). Compared to TCGA-COADREAD, mutation frequencies were significantly higher in <i>BRCA2</i>, <i>EGFR</i>, <i>SLC25A5</i>, and <i>PIK3R2</i> (adjusted p < 0.0001). Among 258 total variants, 43% were novel, and 25 were classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or deleterious, including 13 novel variants across nine genes. Pathway analysis revealed frequent disruptions in WNT/\u03b2-catenin (65%), homologous recombination (61%), PI3K (48%), and RTK/RAS (43%) signaling pathways. Our results reveal a distinct mutational profile in Saudi CRC patients, characterized by novel and enriched somatic variants affecting key oncogenic pathways.

          "abstract": "Loss of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is frequently observed in various cancers and promotes tumorigenesis by activating the PI3K-AKT pathway. However, the effectiveness of therapies targeting this pathway is limited by complex signaling crosstalk and compensatory mechanisms. Here, we employed quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses using MCF10A PTEN KO models to comprehensively map the signaling alterations induced by PTEN loss. Our analyses revealed that PTEN deficiency not only activates canonical PI3K-AKT signaling but also induces widespread changes in cytoskeleton organization, cell cycle regulation, and central carbon metabolism. PTEN loss also substantially elevates the activity of a variety of tyrosine kinases, including Src kinase and EphA2, a receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in cancer progression. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that Src activation, rather than the canonical AKT signaling pathway, drives the upregulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2. The activation of the noncanonical tyrosine kinase signaling renders AKT inhibition alone insufficient in PTEN-deficient cancers. Importantly, combined treatment with the Food and Drug Administration-approved AKT inhibitor capivasertib and the Src inhibitor dasatinib synergistically induced apoptosis and suppressed the tumor cell growth in various PTEN-deficient cell lines as well as in 3D cultures of endometrial cancer patient-derived xenograft models. Our study reveals that PTEN loss drives oncogenic signaling via dual activation of PI3K-AKT and tyrosine kinase pathways. Specifically, Src-mediated upregulation of EphA2 in PTEN-deficient cells highlights a therapeutic vulnerability that can be exploited by combined AKT and Src inhibition. This approach addresses the resistance associated with AKT inhibition alone and enhances therapeutic efficacy in PTEN-deficient cancers, supporting its potential application in targeted combination therapies.",

Here, we address the challenge of assessing the possible alteration of intra- and inter-cellular molecular interactions among processes or cells. We present an approach, designated as \"Ulisse\", which complements the existing methods in the domains of enrichment analysis, pathway crosstalk analysis and cell-cell communication analysis. It applies to gene lists that contain quantitative information about gene-related alterations, typically derived in the context of omics or multi-omics studies. Ulisse highlights the presence of alterations in those components that control the interactions between processes or cells. Considering the complexity of statistical assessment of network-based analyses, crosstalk quantification is supported by two distinct null models, which systematically sample alternative configurations of gene-related changes and gene-gene interactions. Further, the approach provides an additional way of identifying the genes associated with the phenotype. As a proof-of-concept, we applied Ulisse to study the alteration of pathway crosstalks and cell-cell communications in triple negative breast cancer samples, based on single-cell RNA sequencing. In conclusion, our work supports the usefulness of crosstalk analysis as an additional instrument in the \"toolkit\" of biomedical research for translating complex biological data into actionable insights.",

          "abstract": "Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a pivotal mechanism in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. Concurrently, glycosylation, as a key post-translational modification, plays a critical role in regulating cell signaling, immune evasion, and metastasis. Although both processes are independently implicated in tumor biology, the intersection between ferroptosis and glycosylation remains largely unexplored. We performed a comprehensive pan-cancer multi-omics analysis, integrating bulk transcriptomics, epigenomics, and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Ferroptosis and glycosylation-related genes were curated from The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB), leading to the identification of the metal ion transporter, SLC39A14 (solute carrier family 39 member 14), as a key intersecting gene. A ferroptosis-related gene signature was constructed using machine learning and Cox regression models, followed by survival analyses, immune microenvironment profiling, and a pathway enrichment analysis across The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. SLC39A14 was found to be significantly upregulated across multiple tumor types and associated with a poor prognosis, immune-stromal infiltration, and ferroptosis resistance. Among all cancer types analyzed, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and kidney renal cell carcinoma (KIRC) exhibited the significantly prognostic associations and the most pronounced differential expression of SLC39A14. Single-cell analysis revealed that SLC39A14 expression was enriched between stromal and immune populations, hypoxic perivascular niches, confirming its microenvironment-specific functions. These findings were corroborated by DNA methylation data showing promoter hypomethylation of SLC39A14 in tumors compared to normal tissues. Functionally, SLC39A14 was highly enriched in pathways related to angiogenesis, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cytokine signaling, and oxidative stress adaptation including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cell metabolism-related signaling. A nomogram integrating SLC39A14 expression with clinical parameters improved overall survival predictions. In this study, we identified SLC39A14 as a dual regulator at the interface of ferroptosis and glycosylation, with significant impacts on tumor microenvironmental remodeling and therapeutic resistance. By leveraging multi-omics and single-cell transcriptomic data, we establish SLC39A14 as a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target, particularly in brain and kidney cancers where ferroptosis modulation could offer novel clinical strategies.",

Mechanistically, TLK2 phosphorylates DYNLL1, enhancing its interaction with CTCF to promote CTCF-cohesin hub formation at the KLF4 locus. Suppressing TLK2 impairs cancer stemness plasticity, sensitizes cancer cells to cytotoxic stress in vitro, and reduces lung metastases and enhances immunotherapy response in breast cancer mouse models.

We reprocessed TCGA/CGGA RNA\u2011seq to transcripts\u2011per\u2011million and re\u2011annotated tumours under the WHO 2021 taxonomy. Differential expression, Kaplan-Meier, and multivariable Cox models assessed survival associations; gene\u2011set enrichment profiled pathway context. Cell\u2011type sources were mapped by deconvolution and single\u2011cell datasets (GSE131928, GSE89567), and spatial distribution was examined using Ivy GAP and 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009Visium. Protein abundance was validated by quantitative immunohistochemistry in 75 surgical specimens, with orthogonal proteomic corroboration from the TCGA Proteomic Data Commons. COL22A1 mRNA was up\u2011regulated in glioma and increased with grade. High expression predicted shorter overall survival and remained an independent hazard factor after adjusting for age, grade, Karnofsky score, radiotherapy, and temozolomide. Transcriptome deconvolution and Single\u2011cell analyses localized COL22A1 predominantly to mesenchymal-like tumour subpopulations with negligible signal in lymphoid, reactive-glial, or myeloid compartments. Spatial transcriptomics showed marked enrichment in peri\u2011necrotic and microvascular proliferation niches. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) linked COL22A1\u2011high tumours to epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell-cycle, and inflammatory (IL6/JAK-STAT3, TNF-NF\u03baB) programmes, consistent with a proliferative and hypoxic phenotype. Immunohistochemistry confirmed higher protein abundance in tumours versus normal brain, a stepwise increase with grade, and a trend association with Ki\u201167; mass\u2011spectrometry data corroborated increased protein abundance and adverse survival at high expression. A parsimonious nomogram combining COL22A1 with clinical covariates improved the prediction of 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival.

          "abstract": "Oncologists deciding on cancer treatments must make difficult decisions as to which prescription and implementation strategies would best suit each patient. Much is still unknown about combinations of prescription drugs as there are many to choose from. At the outset, the oncologist reckons with at least two established facts: (i) patients receiving successive single molecules treatments are likely to experience drug resistance, and (ii), to select optimal drug combinations requires to pick the 'best' protein drug target combinations. Intuitively, target selection should precede drug selection, implying that well-informed strategies would opt to first consider drug targets - not drugs - combinations. Nowadays, drug combinations that oncologists consider are empirical and limited. They are restricted primarily by observations and praxis, that is, scant clinical experience with their application. Here we develop a strategy for selecting optimal drug target combinations following nature. We use protein-protein interaction networks and shortest paths to discover communication pathways in cells based on interaction network topology. Our strategy mimics cancer signaling in drug resistance, which commonly harnesses pathways parallel to those blocked by drugs, thereby bypassing them. We select key communication nodes as combination drug targets inferred from topological features of networks. We test our network-informed signaling-based approach to discover anticancer drug target combinations on available clinical data, patient-derived breast and colorectal cancers. Alpelisib + LJM716 and alpelisib + cetuximab + encorafenib combinations diminish tumors in breast and colorectal cancers, respectively. Our network-based approach discovers optimal protein co-target combinations to counter resistance, selecting co-targets from alternative pathways and their connectors.",

The study found that THOC3 expression is strongly associated with tumor mutational burden, microsatellite deletion, and immune response. The expression of THOC3 is significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration, and THOC3 can regulate transcription output and mRNA splicing.

          "abstract": "Approximately 15% of patients with resected pathological stage IA lung adenocarcinoma develop recurrent disease, indicating the formation of a cancer metastasis-promoting microenvironment, and highlighting the importance of identifying early prognostic biomarkers. The MECA-79 epitope is a glycan structure modulating immune response, normally expressed on high endothelial venules. Ectopic MECA-79 expression has been recently reported in several cancer cells and is associated with poor prognosis. In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to investigate the clinical and pathological significance of tumoral MECA-79 expression in early-stage lung cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis for MECA-79 was performed in 195 patients with pathological stage IA lung adenocarcinoma undergoing lobectomy. Clinical, radiological, and pathological factors were assessed, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and univariable Cox regression proportional hazards models. Multivariable Cox analyses were performed as exploratory analyses only due to the limited number of recurrence events. Tumoral MECA-79 expression was observed in 5.1% of cases (n\u2009=\u200910). Patients with MECA-79+ tumor cells exhibited a larger pathological invasive size (2.1 vs. 1.6\u2009cm, P\u2009=\u20090.044), higher rates of vascular invasion (90.0% vs. 40.0%, P\u2009=\u20090.0023), and increased 5-year postoperative recurrence (40.0% vs. 7.6%, P\u2009=\u20090.0061). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significantly worse RFS for patients with MECA-79+ tumor cells (5-year rate: 54.9% vs. 87.4%, P\u2009=\u20090.003). The univariate Cox regression model identified body mass index, histological grade based on the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer histological grading system, vascular invasion, spread through air spaces, and the presence of MECA-79+ tumor cells as prognostic factors. Our results indicate that tumoral MECA-79 expression is associated with the recurrence of resected pathological stage IA lung adenocarcinoma; however, these findings should be validated in multicenter, stage-matched cohorts.",

          "abstract": "Cancer is a global health threat, with its treatment modalities transitioning from single therapies to integrated treatments. This paper systematically explores the key technological systems in modern cancer treatment and their application value. Modern cancer treatment relies on four core technological pillars: omics, bioinformatics, network pharmacology (NP), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Omics technologies integrate various biological molecular information, such as genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, providing foundational data support for drug research. But the differences in data and the challenges of integrating it often lead to biased predictions, and that's a big limitation for this technology. Bioinformatics utilizes computer science and statistical methods to process and analyze biological data, aiding in the identification of drug targets and the elucidation of mechanisms of action. It is important to note that the prediction accuracy largely depends on the algorithm chosen. Consequently, this dependence may affect the reliability of the research results. NP, based on systems biology, studies drug-target-disease networks, revealing the potential for multitargeted therapies. That said, this method may overlook important aspects of biological complexity, such as variations in protein expression. This oversight can lead to overestimating the effectiveness of multi-targeted therapies, resulting in false positives in efficacy assessments, which somewhat limits its practical usefulness. MD simulation examines how drugs interact with target proteins by tracking atomic movements, thus enhancing the precision of drug design and optimization. Nevertheless, this technology faces practical challenges, such as high computational costs and sensitivity of model accuracy to the parameters of the force field. The synergistic application of these technologies significantly shortens the drug development cycle and promotes precision and personalization in cancer therapy, bringing new hope to patients for successful treatment. However, researchers still face challenges like the variability of data. Future efforts need to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to establish standardized data integration platforms, develop multimodal analysis algorithms, and strengthen preclinical-clinical translational research to drive breakthrough advancements in cancer treatment. With the ongoing technological improvements, the vision of personalized medicine-tailored treatments based on individual patient characteristics-will gradually be realized, significantly enhancing treatment efficacy and improving patients' quality of life.",

          "abstract": "TEA domain transcription factor 4 (TEAD4), a key effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, has been increasingly associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Despite its recognized role, comprehensive pan-cancer analyses of TEAD4 expression patterns, prognostic significance, and therapeutic implications remain scarce. We conducted a systematic evaluation of TEAD4 across diverse tumor types using publicly available datasets, including TCGA. Analyses included gene expression profiling, prognostic correlation, functional enrichment, and drug sensitivity assessments. Additionally, in vitro assays were performed to validate the functional roles of TEAD4 in cancer cell behavior. TEAD4 was significantly overexpressed in multiple cancers and associated with unfavorable prognosis. Functional enrichment analyses implicated TEAD4 in oncogenic processes such as proliferation, metastasis, stemness maintenance, and immune regulation. In vitro experiments confirmed that TEAD4 promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, and stem cell-like properties, while TEAD4 knockdown reversed these phenotypes. TEAD4 expression correlated with genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Drug sensitivity analysis indicated that elevated TEAD4 levels were linked to resistance against several chemotherapeutic agents. Furthermore, a prognostic model based on TEAD4 target gene expression successfully stratified patients by survival risk. Our findings highlight the multifaceted roles of TEAD4 in cancer biology, emphasizing its contribution to tumor progression, therapy resistance, and patient outcomes. The evidence supports TEAD4 as a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target, offering new avenues for translational cancer research.",

Here, we investigated the role of STAG2 mutants in the normal colon using patient-derived wildtype organoids. Using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, we generated STAG2 mutants, and co-cultured these mutants with wildtype organoids, mimicking the presence of such STAG2 mutants in the normal colon. We sought to determine the transcriptional impact of co-culture using scRNAseq. Surprisingly, we uncovered a possible cell-cell interaction between STAG2 mutants and wildtype organoids, in which wildtype organoids in co-culture with STAG2 mutants upregulated known oncogenic pathways. This included the upregulation of TNF\u03b1-signaling, as well as KRAS-signaling in wildtype organoids. These results suggested that STAG2 mutant cells exert a pro-oncogenic effect in a cell interactive manner, instead of via a cell autonomous approach.

          "abstract": "Monocytes and macrophages are sentinels of the immune system that distinguish themselves from other cells by expressing the beta isoform of the folate receptor (FR\u03b2). Because FR\u03b2 does not bind folate until the monocyte/macrophage is exposed to immunosuppressive cytokines, the question naturally arose whether FR\u03b2 might also perform an immune-related function. To examine this matter, we compared the properties of wild type (WT) and FR\u03b2 knockout mice. We observe that FR\u03b2 knockout (KO) mice display autoimmune symptoms that can include alopecia, enlarged spleens, and dermatitis, despite having normal cellular folate levels. We further demonstrate that syngeneic tumors (TRAMP C2, MC38) grow much slower in FR\u03b2 KO mice than wildtype mice. Comparison of cells extracted from syngeneic tumors of KO mice further reveal that CD69+ T cells are increased while PD1+ T cells and PD-L1+ myeloid cells are decreased in KO tumors. More detailed comparison of the bone marrow-derived macrophages from KO and WT mice demonstrates that KO mice have upregulated pro-inflammatory genes and downregulated anti-inflammatory genes. Because blockade of FR\u03b2 with a monoclonal antibody or deletion of FR\u03b2 impairs direct macrophage suppression of T cell activation <i>in vitro</i>, we conclude that FR\u03b2 performs a checkpoint function that regulates the immunologic properties of tumor myeloid cells. Since FR\u03b2 expression in human cancers is shown to correlate inversely with overall survival, we further posit that FR\u03b2 similarly performs an immunosuppressive function in human tumors.",

This study aims to identify and verify CXCL13 with predictive value for prognosis in UCEC. CXCL13 mRNA expression differences were analyzed using R software in three independent datasets: one each from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and two from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), namely GSE17025 and GSE106191. The correlation between CXCL13 expression and prognosis was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were utilized to construct a prognostic nomogram. Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) and the Tumor and Immune System Interaction Database (TISIDB) were employed to assess the relationship between CXCL13 and tumor immune infiltration. Coexpressed genes with CXCL13 were identified by the Spearman correlation analysis. A CXCL13 protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed with the STRING website tool and hub genes were screened out. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) analyses were performed with the \"clusterProfiler\" R package. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to identify underlying biological mechanisms. A drug-gene interaction network was constructed in the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). High CXCL13 mRNA expression were validated in UCEC in the above three independent datasets. High CXCL13 expression was associated with favorable prognosis in UCEC. A nomogram for predicting the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival probability in UCEC was construct based on CXCL13 expression and other clinical parameters. The use of Spearman correlation indicated certain correlation between CXCL13 and immune cells and immune checkpoint (ICP) genes. Seven hub genes were upregulated in UCEC, namely CXCL9, IFNG, CXCL10, CXCL11, GBP5, CCL18, and GZMB. The expression and prognostic relevance of CXCL9, IFNG, GBP5, and GZMB were in accordance with CXCL13. The main biological processes enriched were cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling pathway. The above comprehensive analyses suggest that CXCL13 may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker for UCEC, specifically for early-stage UCEC.",

          "abstract": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) cells exploit vesicle trafficking proteins, such as myoferlin (encoded by MYOF), to fuel tumor aggressiveness, yet the presence and function of myoferlin-dependent vesicles in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) remain unknown. By combining PAAD whole-tumor and single-cell transcriptomic analyses with immunohistochemistry and 2D/3D in vitro models, we link stromal myoferlin to tumor aggressiveness. We identify CAF-specific functions of myoferlin, as MYOF-depleted CAFs exhibit reduced activity and impaired extracellular matrix (ECM) production. Analysis of intracellular vesicles shows that myoferlin depletion results in a TGF\u00df-receptor 1 (TGFBR1) trafficking blockade at the ER/Golgi interface upon myoferlin depletion, leading to altered TGFBR1 activation, impaired signal transduction, loss of ECM production and reduced CAF contractility. Both genetic depletion of myoferlin in the murine tumor stroma and the pharmacological targeting of myoferlin alike reduced tumor desmoplasia in orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Based on these findings, we propose TGFBR1 trafficking as a potential target for reprogramming CAFs, controlling desmoplasia, and tackling these aggressive features in pancreatic cancer.",

MCL1 copy number gain (14%-34%) correlates with increased MCL1 expression and worse outcomes. MCL1 inhibition exhibits anti-tumour effects in MCL1-gained mCRPC models. Co-inhibition of MCL1 and AKT induces cancer-specific cell death in PTEN-loss/PI3K-activated models in vitro and in vivo, modulating BAD-BCLXL and BIM-MCL1 interactions, with durable anti-tumour activity in models with AKT inhibitor acquired resistance. Finally, CDK9-mediated MCL1 downregulation combined with AKT inhibition recapitulates these findings, providing further opportunities for clinical translation.

While it is well recognized as a diagnostic marker in breast and urothelial cancers, but in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) remains unclear.\u00a0This study aimed to investigate the expression, clinical significance, promoter methylation, immune infiltration, and genetic alterations of GATA3 in STAD using comprehensive bioinformatics approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate GATA3 across multiple datasets in the context of gastric cancer.\u00a0 Methods The analyses were conducted on publicly available datasets, including Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Data Analysis Portal (UALCAN), Kaplan-Meier plotter (KM Plotter), cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics, and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Results Our results revealed that GATA3 is significantly upregulated across multiple cancer types, with the highest expression observed in STAD (p < 0.001). According to cancer stages I-IV, the expression increased in stages II-III but declined in stage IV, suggesting a role in tumor progression. However, survival analyses across several platforms consistently demonstrated no significant association between GATA3 expression and overall survival (p > 0.05). Immune infiltration analysis showed strong correlations between GATA3 expression and CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and macrophages (p < 0.0001), highlighting its potential involvement in shaping the tumor immune microenvironment. Interestingly, despite its upregulation, GATA3 exhibited elevated promoter methylation, suggesting additional regulatory mechanisms beyond epigenetics. Genetic alterations were rare (4%) and did not impact survival outcomes. Conclusion Collectively, these findings suggest that GATA3 is significantly upregulated in STAD and may serve as a novel diagnostic marker associated with immune infiltration.\u00a0The study provides a foundation for future research exploring GATA3 as a potential target for diagnostic development and immunotherapy strategies in gastric cancer.",

          "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as key modulators of gene expression and cellular processes, playing pivotal roles in cancer biology. In breast cancer, a multifaceted malignancy driven by diverse genetic and epigenetic alterations, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is critical for regulating processes such as cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Emerging research highlights intricate interactions between lncRNAs and MAPK signaling components, including ERK, p38, and JNK, revealing novel regulatory mechanisms underlying breast cancer development and progression. These interactions often involve lncRNAs modulating MAPK pathway activity or engaging in crosstalk with other oncogenic networks. This review explores how lncRNAs influence MAPK signaling in breast cancer pathogenesis, emphasizing their dual roles as potential oncogenes or tumor suppressors depending on the molecular context. While these findings suggest that lncRNAs could serve as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets to influence tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance, challenges such as study heterogeneity, conflicting functional outcomes, and the complexity of lncRNA-MAPK interactions limit immediate clinical translation. By elucidating these molecular relationships, we aim to provide insights into breast cancer biology and highlight the potential, as well as the limitations, of leveraging lncRNA-MAPK interactions for improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, pending further mechanistic and clinical validation.

Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are emerging as potential therapeutic targets, especially in cases with FGFR2 gene fusions. However, the prognostic relevance of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 protein expression in PDAC remains unclear. Immunohistochemical analysis of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 was performed on 99 PDAC and 60 adjacent normal pancreatic tissue samples. Protein expression was quantified using the H-score method and correlated with clinicopathological variables and survival. Publicly available datasets from the GEO repository and the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) were used for pathway enrichment analysis and validation of findings at the mRNA level. FGFR2 and FGFR4 showed differential expression between tumor and normal tissues, while FGFR1 did not. High FGFR4 protein expression was significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS) in both univariable and multivariable analyses. FGFR2 high expression cases showed a trend towards poor DFS, while FGFR1 had no prognostic impact. In silico analysis confirmed that high FGFR4 mRNA levels are associated with worse DFS. Co-expression and enrichment analysis linked FGFR4 overexpression with developmental, metabolic, and stemness-related processes. FGFR4 showed the strongest prognostic association among the FGFR family members studied, with high protein expression correlating with shorter disease-free survival in PDAC patients. These findings underscore the potential of FGFR4 as a biomarker for recurrence risk, while also highlighting the complexity of FGFR-related signaling and its context-dependent clinical relevance.",

In this study, we developed MiMouse, a mouse comprehensive genomic profiling panel for high-throughput credentialing applicable to routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors. Through simulation/validation, we focused on considerations for cross-species mutation prioritization, strain determination, and aneuploidy detection. Using MiMouse, we profiled >250 tumors from high-grade serous carcinoma GEMMs based on conditional inactivation of Brca1 (B), Trp53 (P), Pten (Pt), Rb1 (R), and/or Nf1 (N) and a colorectal carcinoma GEMM based on conditional inactivation of Apc, Kras, and/or P. We confirmed increased genomic instability in high-grade serous carcinoma tumors, with BPPt cancers having both the shortest latency and the least genomic instability. In colorectal cancer, focusing on fidelity to human colorectal cancer aneuploidy events, our results highlighted the critical importance of synteny in transgenic studies, as not only was loss of mouse chromosome 18 (containing the tumor suppressor gene Smad4) a significant aneuploidy event (18%), additional tumors harbored focal Smad4 copy loss, potentially due to the mouse-specific proximity of Apc (mouse and human chromosomes 18 and 5, respectively). Likewise, mouse chromosome 5, the only significantly gained (46%) chromosome in our colorectal cancer models, has syntenic blocks from human chromosomes 7p, 7q, and 13q, including Cdx2, which is both a lineage-specific colorectal cancer oncogene and the colorectal cancer GEMM promoter source. Given the importance of mice to translational cancer research, this study highlights the considerations and utility of approaches for comprehensive genomic credentialing.

          "abstract": "The development of resistance to paclitaxel (PTX), which is a vital anticancer drug treating breast and lung cancers, can cause treatment failure and limit further use of taxanes and similar drugs. As previously documented, PTX-induced irresponsiveness to chemotherapy involves the overexpression of ABCC3, ABCC5, and ABCC10 members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transmembrane proteins, which are enriched in the lysosomes of drug-resistant cells where anticancer drugs are actively trapped. In this paper, the role of HIF1A in a BRG1-p300-dependent overexpression of 3 <i>ABCC</i> genes in drug resistant cells was examined. Although motive spacing analysis of BRG1 enriched regions indicated that HIF1A, ISL1, MAF, and ZNF76 could be possible BRG1 co-regulators, <i>bona fide</i> co-operation with BRG1 and the contribution to drug resistance was only confirmed for HIF1A. HIF1A deficiency abolished the transcription promoting effect of BRG1 and p300, thereby suggesting that this protein acts as the master regulator of ABCC transcription. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases confirmed a likely role of HIF1A-BRG1-p300 overexpression in the taxanes resistance of cancer patients and the possible biomarker function of this protein in cancer responses to chemotherapy. Therefore, the complex comprising BRG1-EP300-HIF1A can be considered for further clinical investigation and planning for patient therapy.",

Despite its known involvement in the progression of specific cancers, a comprehensive pan-cancer examination of the prognostic value and biological implications of CA9 has not been performed. This study systematically explored the diverse roles of CA9 across multiple cancer types. Bioinformatics methods were applied via extensive datasets from TCGA, GTEx, CPTAC, CancerSEA, and the public literature. We systematically analyzed the associations between CA9 expression profiles and various clinical parameters, prognosis, immune infiltration, immune-related genes, TMB, MSI, and tumor stemness scores. Additionally, a single-cell functional analysis was conducted. CA9 was significantly upregulated in 29 out of 33 cancer types, indicating high discriminatory ability between tumor and normal tissues. Elevated CA9 expression correlated with poor OS and PFIs in multiple cancers, such as GBMLGG, CESC, LUAD, KIPAN, GBM, THYM, LIHC, THCA, PAAD, and KICH. In 39 cancers, CA9 expression was predominantly negatively correlated with the infiltration of 22 immune cell infiltrations. It was also associated with TMB in 12 tumors and with MSI in 9. Single-cell analysis revealed positive links between CA9 and essential processes such as hypoxia, metastasis, angiogenesis, and stemness.

The additivity of co-occurring driver mutations in different genes (<i>in trans</i>) can lead to powerful proliferation signals.

Our analysis indicates that they are mostly in primary tumors. We list actionable <i>in trans</i> mutations for 2385 metastatic tumors and provide co-occurrence trees of metastatic breast-cancer markers.

          "abstract": "Multi-omics data, which include genomic, transcriptomic, epigenetic, and proteomic data, are gaining increasing importance for determining the clinical outcomes of cancer patients. Several recent studies have evaluated various multimodal integration strategies for cancer survival prediction, highlighting the need for standardizing model performance results. Addressing this issue, we introduce SurvBoard, a benchmark framework that standardizes key experimental design choices. SurvBoard enables comparisons between single-cancer and pan-cancer data models and assesses the benefits of using patient data with missing modalities. We also address common pitfalls in preprocessing and validating multi-omics cancer survival models. We apply SurvBoard to several exemplary use cases, further confirming that statistical models tend to outperform deep learning methods, especially for metrics measuring survival function calibration. Moreover, most models exhibit better performance when trained in a pan-cancer context and can benefit from leveraging samples for which data of some omics modalities are missing. We provide a web service for model evaluation and to make our benchmark results easily accessible and viewable: https://www.survboard.science/. All code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/BoevaLab/survboard/. All benchmark outputs are available on Zenodo: 10.5281/zenodo.11066226. A video tutorial on how to use the Survboard leaderboard is available on YouTube at https://youtu.be/HJrdpJP8Vvk.",

          "abstract": "FANCM is branchpoint DNA translocase essential for cellular response to replication stress. Here, we show that replication stress stimulates FANCM and the TONSL-MMS22L heterodimer bound to histones H3-H4 to form an interdependent complex on chromatin. TONSL-MMS22L recruits FANCM and Fanconi anemia (FA) core complex to stalled and collapsed forks, maintains FANCM on replication-stressed chromatin, promotes FANCD2 monoubiquitination, facilitates both repair and replication traverse of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), and suppresses sister chromatid exchanges, through its interactions with FANCM and H3-H4. Reciprocally, both DNA translocase activity and phosphorylation of FANCM facilitate recruitment of TONSL-MMS22L and RAD51 to perturbed forks. Moreover, TONSL-MMS22L and FANCM function together to promote activation of the FA pathway, ICL repair, homologous recombination and replication traverse. Cancer patients with tumors with wildtype FANCM and low expression of TONSL-MMS22L have a more favorable prognosis than those with high expression. Thus, FANCM-TONSL-MMS22L acts coordinately as a complex on chromatin that resolves replication stress, and this complex may present a therapeutic target for wildtype FANCM-linked cancer.",

          "abstract": "The orchestration of mitotic checkpoint execution depends on the enzymatic activity of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. APC/C functions with the assistance of the adapter protein Cdc20 and the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH10 for orderly progression of mitosis. Reportedly, deregulated expression of either <i>CDC20</i> or <i>UBCH10</i> is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness in various human malignancies, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC). Previously, our laboratory reported that Cdc20 transcriptionally activates <i>UBCH10</i> expression in cultured HNSC cells. This led us to investigate their correlated expression in primary HNSC malignancies in a prospective Eastern Indian study cohort and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. Quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry analyses were performed to assess <i>CDC20</i> and <i>UBCH10</i> expression in primary HNSC patient samples of a prospective Eastern-Indian cohort. The RNA-sequencing data were retrieved from TCGA-head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) cohort. Additionally, FISH assay was carried out to investigate cellular ploidy status in HNSC tumor and adjacent normal samples, as well as in cultured HNSC cells and validated in silico in TCGA cohorts. Assays to evaluate proliferation, migration and invasion of HNSC cells were conducted under the influence of correlated expression of <i>CDC20</i> and <i>UBCH10</i>. Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses was performed to determine the impact of survival outcome under the influence of correlated <i>CDC20-UBCH10</i> expression. The initial results revealed correlated overexpression of both genes in a significant number of primary HNSC samples from the prospective cohort. Concordantly, gene expression data from the TCGA-HNSC cohort revealed a similar correlation. In addition, HNSC-affected individuals with this correlated overexpression showed an increased level of cellular aneuploidy. More importantly, Kaplan\u2012Meier analyses revealed that patients harboring this correlated expression signature had the poorest survival outcome. Findings of exacerbation in proliferation, migration and invasion properties of cultured HNSC cells, under the influence of concerted overexpression of <i>CDC20</i>-<i>UBCH10</i>, further corroborated our findings. Further investigations revealed that this expression signature occurs in several other malignancies of solid tissues and negatively influences their survival outcomes. Together, these findings delineate the correlation of <i>CDC20</i>-<i>UBCH10</i> overexpression with survival outcomes in patients with primary HNSC and other solid tumors and suggest the potential of this expression signature for prognostication.

This study investigates whether the C\u2009>\u2009T (rs912071) polymorphism in the Glutaredoxin 2 (GLRX2) gene, oxidative stress marker levels, and GLRX2 expression are associated with prognosis and recurrence in 341 patients with UBC. Gene expression data were compared to those available in TCGA. The TT genotype (OR\u2009=\u20092.475, p\u2009=\u20090.017) was positively associated with the risk of 1-year recurrence. Hypertensive patients carrying the CT genotype presented a reduced risk for recurrence (OR\u2009=\u20090.460, p\u2009=\u20090.047) and high-grade tumors (OR\u2009=\u20090.188, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) levels were higher in patients than in controls and in patients carrying the TT genotype. Tumor tissues and invasive tumors had higher GLRX2 expression, confirming the TCGA findings. DepMap analysis identifies GLRX2 as a valuable tool enabling personalized treatments for UBC patients. Our results showed that the TT genotype of rs912071 is associated with an increased risk of recurrence and high oxidative stress. In contrast, the CT genotype may protect against disease recurrence in patients with UBC cancer.",

          "abstract": "In this comprehensive study, we explored the molecular landscape C-X-C chemokine receptor (CXCR) family genes (CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR5, and CXCR7) in osteosarcoma (OS) by scrutinizing the expression profiles and functional implications using Bioinformatics analyses and molecular experiments. We found significant up-regulation of these genes in OS cell lines compared to control cell lines, as assessed by RT-qPCR, with high diagnostic potential demonstrated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Cross-validation using the GSE12865 dataset revealed consistent up-regulation of CXCR family genes in OS samples, alongside decreased promoter methylation in tumor samples compared to normal tissues, as confirmed by the UALCAN database. Mutational analysis, conducted using data from 237 OS samples from the cBioPortal database, revealed minimal mutations in CXCR1 and CXCR2, with no alterations in CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR5, and CXCR7. Copy number variation (CNV) analysis showed some level of amplification in CXCR1 and CXCR2, but no significant alterations in the copy numbers of the other genes. Survival analysis using meta-analysis across multiple independent studies showed that the expression of some CXCR genes were significantly associated with poor patient survival. Further exploration of the transcriptional regulation of CXCR genes using the ENCORI database revealed an intricate miRNA-mRNA network involving miR-130a, miR-146a, miR-155, miR-21, and miR-7, which regulate the expression of these genes. Elevated expression of these miRNAs in OS samples was validated by RT-qPCR, with promising diagnostic potential highlighted by ROC analysis. Additionally, the immunological analysis revealed a positive correlation between the expressions of CXCR genes and immune cell types, including macrophages and T cells, and CXCR genes were found to enhance drug responsiveness in OS patients. Gene enrichment analysis identified critical biological processes and pathways, such as chemokine-mediated signaling and immune response, linked to the CXCR family. Knockdown of CXCR1 in HOS and MG-63 cells confirmed that CXCR1 plays a crucial role in cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. CXCR1 knockdown significantly reduced cell proliferation and colony formation, while enhancing cell migration, underscoring its functional importance in OS progression. Overall, our findings suggest that the CXCR family genes are potential diagnostic and prognostic markers in OS, with implications for therapeutic targeting and further investigation into their role in OS pathogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a quality-control pathway that degrades mRNA bearing premature termination codons (PTCs) resulting from mutation or mis-splicing, and that additionally participates in gene regulation of unmutated transcripts. While NMD activity is known to differ between examples of PTCs, it is less well studied if human tissues differ in NMD activity, or if individuals differ. We analyzed exomes and matched transcriptomes from Human tumors and healthy tissues to quantify individual-level NMD efficiency, and assess its variability between tissues, tumors, and individuals. This was done by monitoring mRNA levels of endogenous NMD target transcripts, and additionally supported by allele-specific expression of germline PTCs. Nervous system and reproductive system tissues have lower NMD efficiency than other tissues, such as the digestive\u00a0tract. Next, there is systematic inter-individual variability in NMD efficiency, and we identify two underlying mechanisms. First, somatic copy number alterations can robustly associate with NMD efficiency, prominently the commonly-occurring gain at chromosome 1q that encompasses two core NMD genes: SMG5 and SMG7 and additional functionally interacting genes such as PMF1 and GON4L. Second, deleterious germline variants in genes such as the KDM6B chromatin modifier can associate with higher or lower NMD efficiency in individuals. Variable NMD efficiency modulates positive selection upon somatic nonsense mutations in tumor suppressor genes, and is associated with cancer patient survival and immunotherapy responses.\u00a0 CONCLUSIONS: NMD efficiency is variable across human tissues, and it is additionally variable across individuals and tumors thereof due to germline and somatic genetic alterations.",

Integrating structural, sequence, phylogenetic data, and disease-related mutational data, we compiled a comprehensive study of the Argonaute evolutionary trajectory. By comparing Argonaute proteins across a diverse set of lineages and extensive evolutionary timescale, we identified universal and clade-specific sequence signatures and intra-protein contact networks that underlie the Argonaute structural fold, nucleic acid interface and protein-protein binding sites. We analyze how these features are affected by disease-related mutations and are fundamentally altered in the case of the Argonaute-like Med13 protein.

However, its exact contributions to colorectal cancer (CRC) remain largely unidentified. We aimed to ascertain the prognostic significance of TIMP3 in CRC patients through a bioinformatic approach. GEPIA, UALCAN, Kaplan-Meier plotter, LinkedOmics, cBioPortal, GeneMANIA, TIMER, TISIDB, the ScTIME database, TISMO, TIDE, CAMOIP, and TISCH2 were employed to comprehensively analyze the differential expression, prognostic value, genetic alterations, signaling pathways, immune cell infiltration, tumor microenvironment (TME) and associated genes of TIMP3 in CRC patients. Compared to adjacent normal tissues, we observed a significant downregulation of TIMP3 expression in CRC samples. Gene interaction networks elucidated that TIMP3 and its associated genes play a pivotal role in cancer progression, particularly in processes critical to colorectal cancer, such as extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis. Analysis of the TME further indicates that TIMP3 expression was intricately associated with diverse immune cell types infiltration levels, chemokines, and immunomodulators. Most importantly, those with elevated TIMP3 expression had improved immunological scores. Moreover, TIMP3 exhibited strong correlations with major infiltration-related immune cells, including B cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and fibroblasts. Furthermore, improved immunotherapeutic responses against PD-1/PD-L1 were linked to elevated TIMP3 levels. In TIMP3-high groups, there was a considerable increase in IL10, PDCD1, CD80, CXCL9, and CXCR3. This highlights the extensive influence of TIMP3 downregulation on the immune milieu within CRC. Our findings emphasize the multifaceted involvement of TIMP3 in CRC, not only influencing the molecular pathways associated with cancer progression, but also intricately shaping the immune microenvironment. As a result, TIMP3 appears promising as a potential CRC therapeutic target.",

However, EXO1 loss is well-tolerated, suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms that could be exploited in DDR-deficient cancers. Using CRISPR screening, we find EXO1 loss as synthetic lethal with many DDR genes somatically inactivated in cancers, including Fanconi Anaemia (FA) pathway and BRCA1-A complex genes. We also identify the spliceosome factor and tumour suppressor ZRSR2 as synthetic lethal with loss of EXO1 and show that ZRSR2-deficient cells are attenuated for FA\u00a0pathway activation, exhibiting cisplatin sensitivity and radial chromosome formation. Furthermore, FA or ZRSR2 deficiencies depend on EXO1 nuclease activity and can be potentiated in combination with PARP inhibitors or ionizing radiation. Finally, we uncover dysregulated replication-coupled repair as the driver of synthetic lethality between EXO1 and FA pathway attributable to defective fork reversal, elevated replication fork speeds, post-replicative single stranded DNA exposure and DNA damage. These findings implicate EXO1 as a synthetic lethal vulnerability and promising drug target in a broad spectrum of DDR-deficient cancers unaddressed by current therapies.",

          "abstract": "(1) Background: Somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2), a G protein-coupled receptor, is overexpressed in multiple malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While SSTR2 has traditionally been viewed as an inhibitory receptor involved in suppressing hormone secretion and cell proliferation, emerging evidence suggests a more complex role in cancer biology. However, the functional implications of SSTR2 expression in HCC remain poorly understood. This study aimed to systematically investigate the molecular landscape associated with SSTR2 expression in HCC and evaluate its potential as a therapeutic target. (2) Methods: SSTR2 expression patterns across 22 tumor types were assessed using TNMplot, and its expression in HCC was further validated through The Human Protein Atlas. Integrative analysis of transcriptomic profiles, protein expression data, and somatic copy number alterations was performed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to stratify HCC patients by SSTR2 expression levels. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was conducted via SRplot to uncover biological processes and signaling pathways associated with SSTR2. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed using GEO datasets to determine the prognostic significance of SSTR2 expression. (3) Results: SSTR2 is moderately expressed in the majority of HCC tumors. Elevated SSTR2 expression correlates with significantly poorer overall and disease-specific survival. High SSTR2 levels are associated with activation of oncogenic signaling cascades related to cell proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, and metastasis. Additionally, SSTR2 expression is positively correlated with several receptor tyrosine kinases and oncogenes implicated in HCC progression. (4) Conclusions: Our findings suggest that SSTR2 is not merely a passive biomarker but may contribute to HCC pathogenesis through modulation of oncogenic pathways. These data support the rationale for further development of SSTR2-directed therapeutic strategies to inhibit tumor growth and invasion in HCC patients.",

There has been no pan-cancer analysis examining the immunological function and prognostic significance of STX7 so far. We chose STX7 for an in-depth investigation to explore its expression patterns, prognostic significance, enriched pathways, and immune infiltration across various cancers. The transcriptional landscape of STX7 was examined at both single-cell and spatial levels, and a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments was conducted to further validate its functional roles. STX7 was significantly upregulated in a wide range of cancer types and was associated with poor prognosis. Additionally, STX7 was correlated with immune cell infiltration and key immune regulators. Enrichment analysis further underscored the potential role of STX7 in immune evasion and tumor progression. Single-cell and spatial transcriptome analyses revealed its specific expression in macrophages. Functional experiments demonstrated that STX7 knockout suppressed hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation and migration, while inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via NF-\u03baB signaling. STX7 promotes EMT and tumor progression via NF-\u03baB signaling, with a strong association to macrophage infiltration in cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.

Further analyses revealed the functional characteristics and immune landscapes of these subgroups, providing valuable insights into the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and tumor responses to immunotherapy. Additionally, we developed and validated a prognostic model based on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two LCs, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting patient prognosis, TIME characteristics, and immunotherapy potential in OC. A further investigation explored the relationship between lysosome-associated risk scores, IC50 values of standard antitumor agents, and the expression levels of prognostic genes. Finally, in vitro experiments showed that inhibiting CRHR1, a lysosome-associated prognostic gene, significantly reduced OC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. In conclusion, our study establishes a novel lysosome-based classification and prognostic framework for OC, offering a practical tool to predict clinical outcomes and guide personalized immunotherapy strategies.",

Conventional biomarkers, such as Ki67 and immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based subtypes, are not validated in this population. This study assessed the prognostic value of clinical and genomic biomarkers and explored age-related clinicopathological and gene expression differences. A retrospective cohort of 658 patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative EBC who underwent genomic risk testing between 2015 and 2023 at a single institution was analyzed. Patients were stratified by age at diagnosis: \u226440 years (n = 81), 41-50 years (n = 232), and >50 years (n = 345). Clinical data, treatments, and outcomes were assessed. Prediction Analysis of Microarray 50/Prosigna was used to determine intrinsic subtypes and risk of recurrence (ROR); The Cancer Genome Atlas data were used for validation. Survival analyses included Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, and Cox models. Young patients at diagnosis (age \u226440 years) had more locally advanced tumors, higher Ki67, and a greater prevalence of luminal B subtype. Clinical and IHC markers poorly predicted ROR; notably, 50% of Ki67 <10% tumors in young women were ROR high-risk. Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) was lower in young patients (82.8%) compared with older groups (90.5% and 92.8%, respectively; P = 0.042). Among IHC luminal A-like tumors, young age was associated with increased recurrence risk [hazard ratio (HR) 5.75, P < 0.001]. ROR score was independently prognostic in young women (HR 3.12, P = 0.004). Gene expression revealed lower estrogen-related and higher basal-like gene levels in younger patients. Young women with ER-positive, HER2-negative EBC have poorer outcomes. Ki67, in particular, is a poor prognostic marker in this group. Genomic profiling improves risk stratification and highlights unique tumor biology, supporting personalized treatment strategies.",

          "abstract": "Ongoing studies suggest that letrozole (LTZ), a drug used in the treatment of breast cancer, can potentially be repurposed as a novel therapeutic for glioblastoma (GBM). In a phase 0/1 trial in recurrent GBM patients we observed that LTZ permeates into the GBM tissue and triggers dose-dependent changes in the expression of genes regulating cell cycle (e.g. CDKN2A/N2B, CDK4). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that a combination of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors with LTZ may result in synergistic anti-GBM activity. Therefore, we assessed the anti-tumor effects of LTZ in combination with ribociclib, a third-generation CDK4/6 inhibitor and the brain pharmacokinetics of ribociclib. Using cell viability and neurosphere growth assay against a panel of patient-derived GBM lines both compounds were found to be cytotoxic when used as single agents and were strongly synergistic when used in combination. We then assessed the DNA damaging effects (\u0263H2AX induction), cell cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis (Annexin V-FITC/PI) of both compounds as single agents and when used in combination. LTZ potentiated ribociclib-induced DNA damage and cell cycle arrest leading to apoptosis. Systemic and brain pharmacokinetics analysis of ribociclib in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats by serial blood and brain extracellular fluid (ECF) sampling showed that ribociclib penetrates the blood-brain barrier with a partitioning coefficient (Kpu, u, brain) of about 10%. Overall, our studies suggest that a combination of ribociclib with LTZ is likely to be strongly synergistic against GBM at concentrations of the drugs that can be achieved in the brain.",

          "abstract": "The RAS signaling pathway, particularly through mutations in KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS, plays a pivotal role in driving oncogenesis in a wide range of cancers. For years, RAS proteins were deemed \"undruggable\" due to their smooth surface and lack of deep binding pockets. However, recent breakthroughs in targeting specific RAS mutations, particularly KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>, have revolutionized the field. The discovery of covalent inhibitors that bind to an allosteric pocket near the cysteine residue of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> has led to the development of FDA-approved drugs, marking a significant milestone in RAS-targeted therapy. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of direct RAS inhibitors, focusing on the chemical development of small molecule inhibitors, molecular glues, protein degraders, and other emerging strategies. We highlight the structural evolution of KRAS inhibitors, from covalent fragment-based approaches to non-covalent inhibitors and pan-RAS targeting strategies. Additionally, we discuss the clinical progress of key inhibitors, including their efficacy, resistance mechanisms, and combination treatment options. Finally, this review explores other innovative approaches such as cyclopeptide inhibitors and outlines future directions of RAS-targeting strategies. The success of RAS-targeted therapies underscores the transformative potential of overcoming the \"undruggable\" nature of RAS, offering new hope for patients with RAS-driven cancers.",

In this study, through comprehensive integrative analyses of bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq data, we identify COL4A2 as a critical orchestrator of vascularization in GBM. Elevated COL4A2 not only promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in glioma cells, but also increases vascularization in GBM. Multi-omics profiling and mechanistic investigations reveal that aberrant expression of the anti-pause enhancer JMJD6 mediates the upregulation of COL4A2 in GBM. Furthermore, we demonstrate that COL4A2 promotes GBM vascularization by activating PI3K-AKT and MAPK-ERK signaling through interaction with ITGA1/ITGB1 receptors on tumor-associated endothelial cells (TECs). Pharmacological inhibition of the COL4A2-ITGA1/ITGB1 axis with obtustatin attenuates pro-angiogenic signaling, suppresses vascularization, and prolongs survival in orthotopic GBM models. Collectively, our findings establish JMJD6-driven COL4A2-ITGA1/ITGB1 axis as a novel anti-angiogenic therapeutic vulnerability, offering a promising strategy to disrupt TEC-tumor symbiosis and impede GBM progression.",

Depending on the tumor context, PRKD1 exhibits either oncogenic or tumor-suppressive functions. This study aimed to delineate the role of PRKD1 in cancer progression and assess its diagnostic and prognostic potential across multiple cancer types. We analyzed PRKD1 expression using Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), and University of ALabama at Birmingham CANcer data analysis Portal (UALCAN) databases, and assessed its prognostic significance via the Kaplan-Meier plotter. Mutation profiles were examined using cBioPortal, while gene-gene and protein-protein interactions were evaluated through GeneMANIA and STRING, respectively. Pathway enrichment was performed using Enrichr. Findings were validated using three GEO datasets: GSE24152, GSE15641, and GSE110224. PRKD1 expression was significantly downregulated in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), kidney chromophobe (KICH), and rectum adenocarcinoma (READ) (all p < 0.001). Expression levels varied significantly with clinical parameters, including age, gender, race, and tumor stage. Immune infiltration analysis revealed significant associations between PRKD1 expression and immune cell subsets, namely, B cells, CD4\u207a T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells in thyroid carcinoma (THCA), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). A notable inverse correlation was observed between PRKD1 and CD8\u207a T cell levels in THCA (p > 0.05). Survival analysis demonstrated that low PRKD1 expression correlated with improved prognosis in STAD, THCA, and LIHC, whereas high expression was favorable in KIRC (p = 0.001). Promoter methylation of PRKD1 was significantly increased in KICH and READ and decreased in BLCA (all p < 0.001), suggesting epigenetic regulation underlies its differential expression. PRKD1 serves as a potential diagnostic biomarker in BLCA, KICH, and READ, and as a prognostic indicator in STAD, THCA, LIHC, and KIRC. Its expression is modulated by epigenetic mechanisms and correlates with immune cell infiltration, underscoring its relevance in tumor immunobiology and potential as a therapeutic target.",

This study revisits prior diagnoses of HGGs and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) in children and incorporates next-generation sequencing (NGS) to classify tumors according to the revised criteria and analyze their clinicogenomic characteristics and outcomes. A retrospective review of pediatric patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (AOA), gliomatosis cerebri, or PNET between 1997 and 2023 was conducted. Cases underwent pathology review, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and BT-targeted NGS for reclassification per WHO CNS5. An additional 20 patients diagnosed with pHGG via genetics-integrated diagnosis since 2020 were included. Clinical characteristics, genomic alterations, and outcomes were analyzed. Among the 78 reviewed cases, 41 were reclassified as pHGGs. <i>TP53</i> mutations were the most prevalent, particularly in DpHGG-H3wt/IDHwt, which showed associations with cancer predisposition syndrome (CPS). Two patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) developed DpHGG-H3wt/IDHwt adjacent to prior radiation fields. The 2-year overall survival (OS) rates were lowest in DpHGG-H3wt/IDHwt (23.2%) and highest in IHG (92.3%). Long-term survival was observed in IHG patients, with a 5-year OS rate of 73.8%, indicating the need for different adjuvant treatment strategies compared to other pHGGs. BT-targeted NGS facilitates the reclassification of pHGGs, revealing associations with CPS. Routine germline sequencing is warranted, and accurate molecular diagnosis enables a shift in treatment strategies tailored to specific pHGG subtypes.",

          "abstract": "Blood-based circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis has emerged as a highly relevant non-invasive method for molecular profiling of solid tumors, offering valuable information about the genetic landscape of cancer. Somatic mutation analysis of ctDNA is now used clinically to guide targeted therapies for advanced cancers. Recent advancements have also revealed its potential in early detection, prognosis, minimal residual disease assessment, and prediction/monitoring of therapeutic response. In recent years, significant progress has been made with the development of various PCR and NGS-based methods designed for assessing gene variants in ctDNA of patients with cancer. However, despite the transformative possibilities that ctDNA analysis presents, challenges persist. Standardization of preanalytical and analytical protocols, assay sensitivity, and the interpretation of results remain critical hurdles that need to be addressed for the widespread clinical implementation of ctDNA testing. In addition to somatic mutations, emerging studies on DNA methylation (epigenomics) and fragment size patterns (fragmentomics) in several types of biological fluids are yielding promising results as non-invasive biomarkers for effective cancer management. This review addresses the clinical applications of somatic gene variants in ctDNA, emphasizes their potential as cancer biomarkers, and highlights essential factors for successful implementation in clinical laboratories and cancer management.",

          "abstract": "Molecular alterations drive the pathogenesis of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), yet reliable prognostic biomarkers remain elusive. Heat shock proteins (HSPs), which mediate cellular stress responses, are implicated in cancer progression and treatment resistance. This study aimed to evaluate whether HSP27 and HSP70 expression correlate with clinicopathological features and survival outcomes in LSCC. Specifically, we assessed their potential as prognostic biomarkers in this malignancy. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 158 LSCC tissue samples from 40 patients and compared to 30 normal laryngeal tissue samples. Expression levels of HSP27 and HSP70 were correlated with clinicopathological variables. Validation was conducted using transcriptomic and survival data from 112 LSCC cases in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to assess survival. HSP27 was significantly overexpressed in LSCC tissues compared to controls and was associated with advanced tumor stage, nodal metastasis, alcohol abstinence, and older age. HSP70 expression correlated with higher tumor grade and female sex but did not differ significantly between cancerous and noncancerous tissues. In the TCGA cohort, low expression of HSP27 and HSP70 was significantly associated with worse overall survival. Low HSP27 expression emerged as an independent predictor of shorter survival (hazard ratio 2.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-4.67; p\u2009=\u20090.024). HSP27 and HSP70 show potential as prognostic biomarkers in LSCC, with high expression linked to favorable outcomes. These findings warrant further investigation into their mechanistic roles in tumor progression, therapy resistance, and their potential utility as therapeutic targets.",

Whereas the functional significance of frequent mutations is well established, the significance of rare mutations remains unknown. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the function of rare RAS variants and provide new insights about their clinical relevance. A total of 298 K/N/HRAS variants (169, 72, and 57 variants, respectively) reported in the COSMIC database v100 were introduced into 3T3 cells. Subsequently, the drug sensitivity of KRAS variants to BI-2865, a noncovalent pan-KRAS inhibitor, was evaluated using the mixed-all-nominated-in-one method. The 3T3 focus formation assay newly identified 35 KRAS, 10 NRAS, and 21 HRAS variants as transforming competent. The oncogenicity assessed in the present study was consistent with that reported in the database. The drug sensitivity assay identified 15 KRAS variants sensitive to BI-2865. BI-2865 treatment inhibited the RAS downstream signaling pathways and induced apoptosis in cells with the sensitive variants. The present study identified 66 new oncogenic RAS variants. The sensitivity of KRAS variants to BI-2865 varies by variant. Functional analysis provides clues for the treatment of patients with rare RAS variants. This study presents the first comprehensive functional analysis of 298 rare RAS variants, identifying 66 novel oncogenic mutations and 15 KRAS variants sensitive to the noncovalent pan-KRAS inhibitor BI-2865. The heterogeneity in drug responses among KRAS variants underscores the need for variant-specific therapeutic strategies. These findings provide a preclinical framework for guiding personalized treatment in RAS-driven cancers and a valuable resource for understanding the clinical relevance of rare RAS mutations.",

The challenge is to combine the complex information of ACC with artificial intelligence (AI) and clinical and pathology data to achieve precision medicine and improve patient prognosis. We developed the Steroid-related Immune Score (SIS) using multi-modal analysis of genomics, digital pathology, and artificial intelligence and validated it in external datasets. In addition, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of small samples and in vitro functional experiments. SIS delivered a stable performance with an AUC of 0.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01 in the ResNet50 and Vision Transformer-B16 models. We validated the best model in external ACC cohorts. Using Class Activation Maps (CAMs) technology revealed that SIS was associated with lymphocyte infiltration, establishing it as a new feature in addition to the Weiss scoring system. Patients in the high SIS group responded well to immunotherapy, while the low SIS group showed adaptability to hormone inhibition therapy. Single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed the relationship between the tumor microenvironment and drug resistance in ACC. In vitro functional assays demonstrated that elevated DHCR7 gene expression correlated with unfavorable prognosis and treatment sensitivity, identifying it as a prospective therapeutic target. Furthermore, there are similarities between the metabolic characteristics of ACC and schizophrenia, such as calcium and iron ion levels. Our multi-modal analysis comprehensively characterizes the immune microenvironment of ACC, emphasizing the synergistic regulation of metabolic and immune gene clusters that influence ACC patients' responses to immune and hormone therapies.",

TP53 is among the most frequently mutated pathways in CRC; however, its role in EOCRC, especially in relation to disparities and treatment outcomes, remains poorly defined. We developed AI-HOPE-TP53, a novel conversational AI agent, to enable a real-time, disparity-aware analysis of TP53 pathway alterations in EOCRC. AI-HOPE-TP53 integrates a fine-tuned biomedical large language model (LLaMA 3) with harmonized datasets from cBioPortal (TCGA, MSK-IMPACT, AACR Project GENIE). Natural language queries are translated into workflows for mutation profiling, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and odds ratio estimation across clinical and demographic subgroups. The platform replicated known genotype-phenotype associations, including elevated TP53 mutation frequency in EOCRC and poorer prognosis in TP53-mutated tumors. Significant findings included a survival benefit for patients with early-onset TP53-mutant CRC treated with FOLFOX (<i>p</i> = 0.0149). Additional exploratory analyses showed a trend toward higher prevalence of TP53 pathway alterations in Hispanic/Latino EOCRC patients (OR = 2.13, <i>p</i> = 0.084) and identified sex-based disparities in treatment, with women being less likely than men to receive FOLFOX (OR = 0.845, <i>p</i> = 0.0138). AI-HOPE-TP53, developed in this study and made publicly available, is the first conversational AI platform tailored for pathway-specific and disparity-aware EOCRC research. By integrating clinical, genomic, and demographic data through natural language interaction, hypothesis generation and equity-focused analyses are enabled, with significant potential to advance precision oncology.",

          "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a unique subtype of breast cancer characterized by high invasiveness, high metastasis rates, and poor prognosis, making it an important focus within global malignancies. Due to the absence of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 expression, TNBC presents significant challenges in treatment. Metastatic progression markedly increases treatment complexity, drastically reducing patient survival rates. The metastatic and drug resistance processes of TNBC involve complex, multi-step biological mechanisms regulated through various molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways within and outside tumor cells. In recent years, immunotherapy has brought new hope for TNBC. Compared to other breast cancer subtypes, TNBC demonstrates higher immunogenicity, often accumulating a higher mutational burden that generates more neoantigens, thus typically resulting in a tumor microenvironment (TME) enriched with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Additionally, PD-L1 expression is significantly higher in TNBC compared to other subtypes, closely correlating with TIL abundance. These characteristics position TNBC as a strong candidate for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Clinical trials have demonstrated promising efficacy of ICIs in TNBC, overturning previous beliefs that breast cancer is generally insensitive to immunotherapy. This review summarizes recent advances regarding resistance types, molecular mechanisms, associated genes and pathways, the role of the tumor microenvironment, and clinical strategies related to immunotherapy resistance in the neoadjuvant setting of TNBC, aiming to provide insights and guidance for future research exploration and clinical practice.",

Tumor profiling has revealed actionable gene alterations that guide treatment strategies and enhance survival. Among Hispanics living in Puerto Rico (PRH), GC ranks among the top 10 causes of cancer-related death. However, the genetic mutational landscape of GC tumors from PRH remains unexplored. This study aimed to identify the most prevalent genetic alterations in GC tumors among PRH. We examined tumor mutational profiles of GC from 106 PRH between 2015 and 2022 (provided by CARIS Life Sciences and the Precision Oncology Alliance). Next-generation sequencing data were available for 85 cases, which were categorized as hypermutated (\u2265\u200910 mutations/megabase) or non-hypermutated (<\u200910 mutations/megabase). Among the non-hypermutated cases, the most frequently mutated genes were TP53 (56.9%), CDH1 (29.2%), ARID1A (27.4%), and KMT2D (25.7%). Compared to TCGA, a majority non-Hispanic cohort, PRH had significantly higher mutational frequencies in driver genes in both intestinal type (TP53, CBLB, and MYH11) and diffuse type (CDH1, ARID1A, and KMT2D) GC. Intestinal-type GC in PR aligns with the chromosomal instability (CIN) molecular classification, showing a higher frequency of TP53 mutations than TCGA, potentially indicating more aggressive tumor biology and poorer prognosis. Diffuse-type GC showed higher CDH1 mutations, correlating with the genomically stable (GS) classification, characterized by fewer chromosomal changes but significant genetic alterations, including those in ARID1A and KMT2D. This study shows that the unique genetic landscape of GC tumors in this group may lead to more aggressive cases and affect treatment responses, contributing to higher mortality rates. The higher mutation rates in biomarkers related to prognosis and therapy suggest that further research might uncover additional susceptibility variants. This underscores the importance of including Hispanics in genomic studies to better understand the genetic pathways associated with the risk and progression of GC.",

In addition, the regulation of <i>CAH</i> genes in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> was examined. These are homologous to <i>CAVII</i> in humans. CAVII expression was analyzed in different cell lines such as human colon cancer (SW480 and HT-29), human prostate cancer (PC3 and LNCaP), human hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep3B) and Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). HT-29 and LNCaP cell lines were subjected to a chemical hypoxia model with CoCl<sub>2</sub>. Real-time PCR was used for <i>CAVII</i> mRNA analysis. Western blot and immunofluorescence (IF) staining were used to detect the CAVII protein. The response of <i>CAH</i> genes was also studied at the mRNA level in a chemical hypoxia model with sodium sulfite in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>. <i>CAVII</i> and <i>CAVII</i>-like genes <i>CAH-3</i>, <i>CAH-4</i>, and <i>CAH-5</i> were analyzed bioinformatically.

In the hypoxia model in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>, <i>CAH</i> genes were downregulated. According to bioinformatics analyses, human <i>CAVII</i> was most similar to <i>CAH-3</i> (98%). The results emphasize the necessity of addressing hypoxic regulation in different cell and organism groups in cancer and healthy conditions for CA family members that change under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

          "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, and upregulation of the WNT pathway is a primary driver in most cases. However, the role of individual WNT proteins in the development of CRC remains poorly understood. Our previous studies demonstrated that WNT2B loss-of-function leads to severe intestinal enteropathy in humans and increases chemically-induced colitis in mice, suggesting a protective function in the colon. Therefore, we investigated how loss of WNT2B affects CRC development. We used azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to model colitis-associated cancer (CAC) and AOM-induced mutagenesis to model sporadic CRC. We measured the number and size of tumors and performed histopathological and molecular analyses. We also analyzed the Cancer Genome Atlas to evaluate <i>WNT2B</i> expression in human colon cancer. In CAC and CRC mouse models, <i>Wnt2b KO</i> mice showed decreased survival and enhanced tumor burden. Moreover, <i>Wnt2b KO</i> mice had larger tumors and enhanced dysplasia, with a higher frequency of animals progressing from adenomas to adenocarcinomas compared to control littermates. <i>Wnt2b KO</i> animals frequently presented with intestinal bleeding and rectum prolapse, which resembles obstructive CRC. Furthermore, <i>WNT2B</i> expression was downregulated in human CRC samples compared to healthy controls, which predicted a significantly lower patient survival. These findings support the conclusion that WNT2B is required for maximal resistance against tumorigenesis and raise the possibility that selectively increasing WNT2B signaling may be a useful colon cancer prevention strategy.",

          "abstract": "Iron is vital to living cells, playing a key role in cellular respiration, DNA synthesis, and various metabolic functions. Importantly, cancer cells have a higher dependency on iron compared to normal cells to support their rapid growth and survival. Due to this fact, tumors are more vulnerable to ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death. Radiation therapy (RT), a standard treatment for many cancer patients, is known to induce ferroptosis. Ultra-high dose rate FLASH RT offers an improved therapeutic window by minimizing damage to normal tissues while preserving tumor control. However, the precise biological mechanisms behind the protective effects of FLASH RT on normal tissues remain unclear. In this study, we propose that variations in lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis, driven by intrinsic differences in iron levels between normal and cancerous tissues, contribute to this effect. Our findings show that FLASH RT increases lipid peroxidation and induces ferroptosis in tumor cells but does not significantly elevate lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in normal tissues compared to conventional RT. To determine whether raising iron levels in normal tissues could abrogate the protective effects of FLASH, mice were fed a high-iron diet before RT. A high-iron diet before and after RT reversed the protective effect of FLASH, resulting in increased intestinal damage and lipid peroxidation. This suggests that baseline iron levels and iron-driven lipid peroxidation are critical factors in mediating the protective outcomes of FLASH RT. Overall, our study sheds light on the role of iron in modulating RT responses and provides new mechanistic insights into how FLASH RT influences normal and cancerous tissues.",

          "abstract": "Malignant tumors remain a major threat to global human health. This study aimed to systematically integrate multi-omics data to identify a candidate gene with biomarker potential across diverse cancer types and to evaluate its possible clinical applications in oncology. We first performed Mendelian randomization based on summary statistics to integrate blood expression quantitative trait loci data with genome-wide association study results from esophageal adenocarcinoma, stomach cancer, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. A comprehensive series of multi-omics bioinformatics analyses was subsequently conducted to assess the gene's expression patterns, genomic alterations, prognostic relevance, and associations with the tumor microenvironment (TME) across various cancer types. In addition, single-cell transcriptome data were analyzed to explore the gene's functional roles in the TME. The key findings were further validated through <i>in vitro</i> experiments. Mendelian randomization identified peptidylprolyl isomerase H (PPIH) as a potential biomarker across multiple malignancies. Single-cell transcriptome analysis suggested that this gene may enhance the proliferative ability of malignant cells and participate in communication between immune and stromal components in the TME. Multi-omics analyses revealed that the gene is abnormally expressed and significantly correlated with patient prognosis in several cancer types. Consistently, <i>in vitro</i> assays demonstrated that increased expression of PPIH promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. This study highlights PPIH as a candidate biomarker with pan-cancer relevance and potential clinical value. These findings offer new directions for cancer diagnosis and provide a foundation for further development of targeted therapeutic approaches.",

We analyzed the correlations between MED12 nonsynonymous mutations and survival, clinical, genomic, transcriptomic information, and immune infiltration information through data mining across multiple datasets. We also investigated the mechanism of MED12 using luciferase assay, Western blot, ChIP-PCR, and siRNA. MED12 is significantly associated with survival in completely independent immunotherapy datasets, including MSKCC (N\u2009=\u2009350), Naiyer2015 (N\u2009=\u200934), our own (N\u2009=\u2009295) and the pan-cancer dataset, but not in the TCGA dataset, where patients received non-immunotherapy regimens. Mutations in MED12 showed no significant correlation with known metrics (TMB, IPS/CTLA4/PD1 status, PD-1/PD-L1 expression, and TCR/BCR status) or DNA Damage Repair (DDR) pathway mutations, yet they carried independent prognostic information according to the Cox multivariate regression. On the other hand, MED12 mutation is significantly associated with multiple immune-related pathways and immune infiltration of CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells and activated NK cells. Lactate dehydrogenase assay revealed that knockdown of TAP2 restored the upregulation of CD8\u2009+\u2009T cell cytotoxicity triggered by MED12 knockdown. ChIP-PCR, luciferase assay and siRNA knock down assay indicate that MED12 binds to the promoter region of STAT1 to suppress its transcription, while the transcription factor STAT1 promotes the transcription of TAP2, thus inhibiting the antigen processing and presentation. Collectively, MED12 mutation is an independent and valuable biomarker for predicting the response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)therapy in NSCLC by modulating CD8\u2009+\u2009T cell cytotoxicity via the STAT1/TAP2 axis.",

We therefore performed comprehensive studies to identify its activity in melanomas employing proximity biotinylation and co-immunoprecipitation combined with LC-MS/MS proteomics and molecular characterization. The results show that LZTR1 regulates the ubiquitin proteasome system in melanoma cells and also associates with actin-related proteins and actin cytoskeleton organization. Its downregulation suppresses the protective effect of the autophagy-initiating ULK1 and AMBRA1, regulators of normal cell survival and proliferation, and upregulates the sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62), an autophagic cargo adapter which mediates selective degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. In contrast, overexpression of LZTR1 provides growth advantage under environmental stress, enhancing cell invasion, by activating ERBB3 receptor and its downstream targets PYK2 and SRC tyrosine kinases that regulate the cytoskeleton, actin organization, cell spreading, cell migration and adhesion. LZTR1 is a \"safeguard\" for melanoma cells under stress and its downregulation can be exploited for melanoma therapy.",

We identify PI5P4K\u03b1 as a critical dependency to support the unique metabolic demands of PDAC cells through its key role in the acquisition of essential metabolic substrates, including glucose and iron. Our data show that inhibition of PI5P4K\u03b1 creates a metabolic bottleneck that PDAC cells cannot overcome through adaptive shifts, leading to cancer-specific apoptotic cell death that is reversible by iron supplementation. Notably, we find that PI5P4K\u03b1 knockdown suppresses tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model of PDAC.

Cuproptosis, a recently defined form of regulated cell death triggered by intracellular copper accumulation, disrupts the tricarboxylic acid cycle and mitochondrial respiration. However, the specific roles and mechanisms of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in HCC pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. We systematically evaluated the expression of 10 CRGs in HCC tissues versus adjacent normal tissues. Bioinformatics analyses included Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were performed. Immune infiltration levels within the tumor microenvironment were assessed. The prognostic significance of CDKN2A was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis and univariate/multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression. CDKN2A protein expression was validated using immunohistochemistry (IHC). CDKN2A was significantly overexpressed in HCC compared to normal tissues. Bioinformatics analyses implicated CDKN2A in DNA replication, organelle fission, and cell cycle checkpoint signaling. Immune-related analysis revealed that high CDKN2A expression correlated positively with dendritic cell (DC) and Th2 cell infiltration, but negatively with CD8\u2009+\u2009T cell and natural killer (NK) cell infiltration. KM analysis demonstrated that high CDKN2A expression predicted significantly shorter overall survival in HCC patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression identified CDKN2A as an independent prognostic risk factor. This study demonstrates that CDKN2A is significantly overexpressed in HCC and plays a role in immune microenvironment modulation. CDKN2A serves as a promising independent prognostic biomarker for HCC, associated with poorer patient survival.",

The main advantage of this system compared to existing techniques is maintenance of endogenous regulatory elements. We used this system to identify both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous regulators of normal melanocyte development.

Due to substantial histologic and transcriptomic differences between subtypes, therapeutic responses often vary, underscoring the need for subtype-stratified analysis and precision drug discovery. <b>Methods:</b> We integrated transcriptomic data from GEO and TCGA to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) specific to EAC, ESCC, and their shared profiles. Functional enrichment (GO, KEGG) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were conducted to extract hub genes using DAVID, STRING, and Cytoscape. Survival associations were evaluated using TCGA-ESCA and UALCAN. Drug repurposing was performed using L1000FWD, L1000CDS2, and SigCom LINCS. <b>Results:</b> We identified 79, 59, and 17 hub genes in the DEG-EAC, DEG-ESCC, and DEG-EAC&ESCC datasets, respectively. In EAC, 16 novel hub genes including SCARB1, SERPINH1, and DSC2 were discovered, which had not been previously implicated in this subtype. These genes were significantly enriched in pathways related to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and epithelial structure. In addition, shared hub genes across EAC and ESCC-such as COL1A1, SPARC, and MMP1-were enriched in ECM organization and cell adhesion processes, highlighting convergent tumor-stroma interactions. Drug repositioning analysis consistently prioritized MEK inhibitors, trametinib and selumetinib, as potential therapeutic candidates across all DEG datasets. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study presents a comprehensive, subtype-stratified transcriptomic framework for EC, identifying both unique and shared hub genes with potential functional relevance to ECM dynamics. Our findings suggest that ECM remodelers may serve as therapeutic targets, and highlight MEK inhibition as a promising, yet exploratory, repurposing strategy. While these results offer a molecular foundation for future precision oncology efforts in EC, further validation through proteomic analysis, functional studies, and clinical evaluation is warranted.",

In this study, we investigated the expression and function of <i>SALL2</i> in CRC. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that <i>SALL2</i> is present in the epithelium and stroma of normal colon tissue but is significantly downregulated in adenomas, carcinomas, and CRC cell lines. Reduced <i>SALL2</i> expression was associated with elevated levels of active \u03b2-catenin and poorer overall patient survival. Functional assays demonstrated that <i>SALL2</i> transcriptionally activates <i>AXIN2</i>, a key negative regulator of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.

          "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> The RTK-RAS signaling cascade is a central axis in colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis, governing cellular proliferation, survival, and therapeutic resistance. Somatic alterations in key pathway genes-including KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and EGFR-are pivotal to clinical decision-making in precision oncology. However, the integration of these genomic events with clinical and demographic data remains hindered by fragmented resources and a lack of accessible analytical frameworks. To address this challenge, we developed AI-HOPE-RTK-RAS, a domain-specialized conversational artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to enable natural language-based, integrative analysis of RTK-RAS pathway alterations in CRC. <b>Methods</b>: AI-HOPE-RTK-RAS employs a modular architecture combining large language models (LLMs), a natural language-to-code translation engine, and a backend analytics pipeline operating on harmonized multi-dimensional datasets from cBioPortal. Unlike general-purpose AI platforms, this system is purpose-built for real-time exploration of RTK-RAS biology within CRC cohorts. The platform supports mutation frequency profiling, odds ratio testing, survival modeling, and stratified analyses across clinical, genomic, and demographic parameters. Validation included reproduction of known mutation trends and exploratory evaluation of co-alterations, therapy response, and ancestry-specific mutation patterns. <b>Results</b>: AI-HOPE-RTK-RAS enabled rapid, dialogue-driven interrogation of CRC datasets, confirming established patterns and revealing novel associations with translational relevance. Among early-onset CRC (EOCRC) patients, the prevalence of RTK-RAS alterations was significantly lower compared to late-onset disease (67.97% vs. 79.9%; OR = 0.534, <i>p</i> = 0.014), suggesting the involvement of alternative oncogenic drivers. In KRAS-mutant patients receiving Bevacizumab, early-stage disease (Stages I-III) was associated with superior overall survival relative to Stage IV (<i>p</i> = 0.0004). In contrast, BRAF-mutant tumors with microsatellite-stable (MSS) status displayed poorer prognosis despite higher chemotherapy exposure (OR = 7.226, <i>p</i> < 0.001; <i>p</i> = 0.0000). Among EOCRC patients treated with FOLFOX, RTK-RAS alterations were linked to worse outcomes (<i>p</i> = 0.0262). The system also identified ancestry-enriched noncanonical mutations-including CBL, MAPK3, and NF1-with NF1 mutations significantly associated with improved prognosis (<i>p</i> = 1 \u00d7 10<sup>-5</sup>). <b>Conclusions</b>: AI-HOPE-RTK-RAS exemplifies a new class of conversational AI platforms tailored to precision oncology, enabling integrative, real-time analysis of clinically and biologically complex questions. Its ability to uncover both canonical and ancestry-specific patterns in RTK-RAS dysregulation-especially in EOCRC and populations with disproportionate health burdens-underscores its utility in advancing equitable, personalized cancer care. This work demonstrates the translational potential of domain-optimized AI tools to accelerate biomarker discovery, support therapeutic stratification, and democratize access to multi-omic analysis.",

Here, through bioinformatics analysis, formosanin C was predicted to be a ferroptosis inducer in colorectal cancer (CRC) by suppressing antioxidation capacity. Indeed, formosanin C induced iron accumulation, lipid ROS formation, and ferroptosis in CRC. We found that <i>TP53</i> and <i>KRAS</i> were the second and third most frequently mutated genes in CRC and were associated with a poor prognosis. Analyses of differentially expressed genes indicated that fatty acid and labile iron levels tended to be higher in CRC than in normal tissues, suggesting the predisposition of CRC cells to ferroptosis. Transcriptomic analyses in CRC patients further identified that wild-type <i>TP53</i> and mutant <i>KRAS</i> separately favored ferroptosis. Likewise, p53 knockdown rendered HCT 116 cells less sensitive to ferroptosis, and KRAS HT-29 cells were more sensitive to ferroptosis compared with their parental counterparts. Moreover, formosanin C synergistically enhanced chemosensitivity to cisplatin, and this process was mediated by lipid ROS. Overall, our novel gene-expression screening platform allows for the efficient identification of the biological function of novel phytochemicals, and the data suggest that formosanin C is an effective ferroptosis inducer in CRC cells with p53 or oncogenic KRAS.",

Here, we describe our findings that functionally demonstrate a nucleolar localization domain in HIF1\u0251 that enables HIF1\u0251 to translocate to the nucleolus. Nucleolar HIF1\u0251 binds the ribosomal DNA promoter and upregulates RNA Polymerase I activity leading to dysregulated ribosomal RNA transcription and consequently enhanced ribosome biogenesis.

Our findings are recapitulated in breast tumors wherein upregulated HIF1\u0251 and rRNA biogenesis are associated with poor prognosis. Finally, our studies demonstrate that inhibition of RNA Polymerase I impedes aggressive traits of hypoxia-driven cancer progression, highlighting the potential of this approach as a therapeutic strategy in breast cancer.

The identification of targeted treatments for NF1<sup>low</sup> ER<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> breast cancer is therefore a priority.

In cell lines, <i>NF1</i> deletion had a dual effect on CDK4 activity: first, by promoting ER recruitment to <i>CCND1</i> (cyclin D1), thereby increasing CDK4-cyclin D1 complex formation, and second, by activating C-RAF (rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma), which drove phosphorylation of the CDK4 activation loop.

However, interrogating WNT pathway dysregulation across clinical and genomic dimensions remains technically challenging, limiting both translational insight and personalized intervention strategies. To address this gap, we developed AI-HOPE-WNT, the first conversational artificial intelligence (AI) agent purpose-built to investigate WNT signaling in CRC using natural language-driven, integrative bioinformatics. AI-HOPE-WNT employs a modular architecture combining large language models (LLMs), a natural language-to-code engine, and a backend statistical workflow interfaced with harmonized data from cBioPortal. Unlike general-purpose platforms, AI-HOPE-WNT is uniquely optimized for WNT-specific precision oncology. The tool supports mutation frequency analysis, odds ratio testing, survival modeling, and subgroup stratification by genomic, clinical, and demographic variables. To validate the platform, we recapitulated findings from two previous studies examining WNT pathway alterations in high-risk CRC populations, including mutation prevalence in RNF43 and AXIN2 and survival outcomes associated with WNT pathway status across ethnic and age subgroups. Exploratory queries further assessed treatment response, co-mutation patterns, and population-specific trends. In recapitulation analyses, AI-HOPE-WNT reproduced key trends from prior work, including improved survival in WNT-altered EOCRC and higher RNF43 mutation rates in Hispanic/Latino (H/L) populations compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) people. Exploratory analyses revealed several novel findings. Among FOLFOX-treated EOCRC patients, APC mutations were associated with significantly different survival outcomes (<i>p</i>\u202f=\u202f0.043). RNF43-mutant tumors showed worse survival in metastatic versus primary cases (<i>p</i>\u202f=\u202f0.028). AXIN1 and APC co-mutations demonstrated location-specific enrichment between colon and rectal tumors. Gender-based differences in AXIN2-mutant cases under varying MSI status yielded significant survival variation (<i>p</i>\u202f=\u202f0.036). Additionally, patients under 50 with APC-mutant primary tumors showed worse survival (<i>p</i>\u202f=\u202f0.031) and increased mutation prevalence.

Protein expression was validated using the Human Protein Atlas and survival analysis was conducted with the Kaplan-Meier database. Functional roles and regulatory mechanisms of cadherin genes were explored through mutational analysis, PPI networks, and miRNA interactions. The results revealed that all three cadherin genes were significantly upregulated in NSCLC cell lines and tissue samples compared to normal controls. Mutational and copy number variation analyses revealed frequent alterations in CDH2, CDH3, and CDH1 in NSCLC. Additionally, we identified hsa-miR-217, hsa-miR-203a-3p.2, and hsa-miR-6766-3p as potential regulatory miRNAs. The results of functional assays indicate that the silencing of CDH1 and CDH2 inhibits cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration in A549 cells, highlighting their potential roles in promoting tumorigenic and migratory properties in NSCLC.

Multiple bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq datasets treated with PD-(L)1 were used to analyze the relationship between TRPM4 and immunotherapy response.

In vitro experiments were performed to validate the role of TRPM4 in human breast, lung adenocarcinoma, and esophageal cancer. TRMP4 expression is higher in most tumors than in normal tissues, and the association with prognosis varies with cancer type. TRPM4 correlates with multiple immune checkpoints as well as the degree of immune cell infiltration. Multiple datasets of anti-PD-(L)1 treatment suggested that high expression of TRPM4 was associated with worse treatment prognosis.

While SRCAP mutations have been previously connected to the pathogenesis of Floating-Harbor syndrome (FHS), these typically occur downstream, with a hotspot mutation leading to protein truncation after amino acid 2444. We found that expressing the SRCAP-1879 truncation in an HRas-CDK4-driven cSCC model was sufficient to increase proliferation, impair terminal differentiation, and accelerate invasion. Mechanistically, the expression of SRCAP-1879 in primary human keratinocytes was sufficient to dysregulate genes crucial for carcinogenesis (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, and motility) without altering H2A.Z occupancy. In particular, the expression of SRCAP-1879 truncation led to strong induction of the matrix metalloproteinase MMP9 expression level, accompanied by increased keratinocyte cell motility, which was sensitive to matrix metalloprotease inhibition. In contrast, the expression of the SRCAP-FHS truncation did not increase but instead reduced cell motility as well as the expression of MMP9. Taken together, our findings identify a previously under-characterized role of the SRCAP-1879 truncating mutation in promoting multiple aspects of epithelial cancer progression, including invasion, distinct from the well-recognized roles of SRCAP mutations in FHS pathogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, characterized by complex genetic and molecular alterations. The Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Non-Receptor Type 6 (PTPN6), also known as SHP-1, plays a critical role in regulating immune responses and cellular signaling pathways, with emerging evidence suggesting its involvement in cancer progression. Previous studies have linked aberrant PTPN6 expression to tumorigenesis in specific cancers, such as lymphoma and leukemia, where it acts as a tumor suppressor. However, the comprehensive role of PTPN6 across pan-cancer, particularly its prognostic significance and molecular functions, has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to provide a pan-cancer analysis of PTPN6, utilizing data from multiple public databases with molecular in vitro experiments. Our findings showed notable differences in PTPN6 expression among different cancer types. Prognostic analyses indicated that higher PTPN6 expression is associated with poorer overall survival in with notable upregulation in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and rectum adenocarcinoma (READ). Further, promoter methylation and mutation analyses highlighted alterations in PTPN6 expression across different cancer stages, with a particular reduction in methylation observed in tumor tissues. Functional assays in cell lines demonstrated that PTPN6 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation, supporting its role in cancer progression. This comprehensive analysis emphasizes the potential of PTPN6 as both a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target in cancer. However, further research is required to fully elucidate its role in cancer progression and to assess its clinical applicability.",

This study aims to discover the potential gene targets and explore how ursolic acid interacts with those genes to restore sensitivity to tamoxifen. Analyzing gene expression data from GeneCards and Swisstargetprediction for UA related genes, and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) for tamoxifen resistance genes. DEGs were analyzed for functional annotation and molecular pathways using DAVID v6.8, continued with constructing a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to highlight crucial genes associated with tamoxifen resistance using STRING-DB and Cytoscape. Genetic alteration analysis using cBioportal for target validation and consideration. Molecular docking was done using Autodock4 and PyMoL for visualisation. The KEGG pathway and PPI network suggest that MDM2, STAT3, TGFB1, and MAPK1 were indicated as potential target genes of UA. Genetic alteration analysis further confirms that MDM2 has the highest alteration, which becomes potentially targeted by UA. Molecular docking analysis confirms that UA can target MDM2 by targeting the N-terminus site on 4HBM and 5ZXF structure. The binding energy of UA is -5.36 for 4HBM and -8.71 for 5ZXF, with all RMSD values below 2. This result shows that UA has a lower docking score than the native ligand for the 5ZXF structure. Additionally, MDM2 is mainly involved in the PI3K-Akt pathway, which plays a role in the chemotherapy resistance mechanism. MDM2 has become a potential target for UA to reverse the tamoxifen resistance mechanism in breast cancer.",

Thus, investigating and understanding how GSLs are regulated in cancer and the impact they have on malignancy have important therapeutic potential. In the GSL biosynthetic pathway, one critical regulator of two of the four major branches of GSLs is the gene product of B3GNT5, which produces the precursor for all GSLs in the lactoside and neolactoside series. Publicly available data was mined to determine the types and prevalence of genetic lesions at the B3GNT5 locus in various cancers, and to assess the impact of increased expression on patient outcomes. HeLa cells in which B3GNT5 was partially depleted using CRISPR-Cas9 approaches were used to determine how its expression levels impacted several phenotypic properties associated with cancer malignancy. Mass spectrometry was used to assess the effect of B3GNT5 on the levels of the Lc3Cer precursors glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and lactosylceramide (LacCer). B3GNT5 copy number gain and overexpression are widespread across human cancers and are significantly associated with poor prognosis. Partial depletion of B3GNT5 in HeLa cells led to accumulation of GlcCer and LacCer, increased chemoresistance, altered EMT marker expression, and decreased activation of multiple RTKs following stimulation with serum-suggesting broad signaling and phenotypic shifts. B3GNT5 is frequently altered in human cancers and correlates with adverse clinical outcomes. Functional depletion reveals its key role in regulating glycosphingolipid metabolism, signaling, and malignant phenotypes. These findings support B3GNT5 as an important target for therapeutic intervention in cancer.",

          "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a prevalent malignant neoplasm, presents significant therapeutic challenges. However, the key factors and mechanisms driving HCC metastasis remain incompletely understood. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism through which CHML regulates the migration and invasion of HCC cells. Following CHML knockout or overexpression, we assessed the proliferative capacity of HCC cells using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine\u00a0(EdU)\u00a0incorporation, colony formation assay, and subcutaneous xenograft tumor models in nude mice. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated using wound healing and Transwell assays. We utilized transcriptome sequencing and untargeted metabolomics to assess the gene's effects on transcriptomic and metabolic changes and its mechanisms in regulating migration. CHML knockout significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro, whereas CHML overexpression promoted these phenotypes (<i>P</i><0.05). Transcriptomic sequencing revealed CHML-mediated regulation of migration-associated pathways, whereas untargeted metabolomics identified choline metabolism as a key significantly altered pathway. Notably, the integration of transcriptomics and untargeted metabolomics identified choline metabolism as a pivotal pathway in CHML-regulated migration and invasion. The subsequent mechanistic analysis demonstrated that CHML upregulated the Solute carrier family 44 member 3 (SLC44A3) to enhance choline uptake, thereby increasing phosphatidic acid (PA) production. This metabolic shift activated MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling cascades, ultimately driving HCC cell migration and invasion. CHML promoted the migration and invasion of HCC cells through multiple pathways. Our findings provide novel insights into metabolic dependencies in HCC metastasis and position CHML as a promising therapeutic target.",

Timely and cost-effective diagnosis, particularly in predicting the risk of metastasis and identifying the deregulation of oncogenic signaling pathways, could open new frontiers towards precision medicine and targeted therapy of EC. However, current diagnostic practices in identifying metastasis and deregulated oncogenic pathways involve molecular testing, which is time-consuming and costly. Advances in deep learning analysis of digital pathological imagery data offer promising avenues for automating and enhancing cancer diagnosis and risk stratification. High-resolution H&E-stained diagnostic whole slide images were obtained from the open repository of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The WSIs underwent several pre-processing steps, including patching, color normalization and augmentation. A deep learning model was designed and trained on WSI data and tissue-level labels to generate image feature representations for predicting metastatic potential and identifying the deregulation of four major oncogenic signaling pathways, viz. mTOR, PTEN, p53, and PI3K/AKT. The proposed model achieved an AUC of 0.92 for predicting metastatic risk and AUCs ranging from 0.64 to 0.92 for the identification of deregulated oncogenic pathways. In a first, we were able to operate the model without the need for exhaustive patch-level annotations, relying instead on slide-level annotations only. In this work, we highlighted the transformative potential of deep learning in accurately detecting metastasis and identifying deregulated oncogenic pathways from H&E slides using slide-level annotation, thus opening new doors in precision medicine and targeted therapy.",

Despite advances in treatment, the overall survival rate for OC patients remains low due to the lack of reliable biomarkers for early detection and prognosis. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to improve patient outcomes. In this study, we explored the potential role of the KCTD (Potassium Channel Tetramerization Domain-containing) family genes in OC. This study utilized comprehensive in silico and in\u00a0vitro experiments. Firstly, we analyzed the expression patterns of KCTD genes across 12 OC cell lines and 6 normal control cell lines using RT-qPCR, identifying significant upregulation of KCTD5, KCTD9, KCTD12, and KCTD16, while KCTD2, KCTD10, KCTD15, and KCTD21 were downregulated. ROC analysis revealed high diagnostic accuracy for KCTD2, KCTD5, KCTD9, and KCTD12. Further stage-specific analysis indicated that KCTD2, KCTD5, KCTD15, and KCTD21 are associated with OC progression. Functional assays in SKOV3 and A2780 cells demonstrated that overexpression of KCTD2 and KCTD10 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation, suggesting their tumor-suppressive roles. Immune and drug sensitivity analyses revealed that KCTD genes may influence immune evasion and chemoresistance in OC. Additionally, miRNA analysis identified potential regulatory mechanisms of KCTD expression. Collectively, our findings indicate that KCTD family members serve as promising biomarkers, offering new insights into therapeutic strategies for OC management. Further validation in clinical settings is essential to establish their potential as therapeutic targets.",

Recurrence is a common challenge, occurring in 52% to 62% of patients with LGGs and 90% of patients with HGGs, complicating clinical management and treatment planning. Currently, no widely available models exist for reliably predicting early glioma recurrence, which is critical for optimizing patient outcomes. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have shown promise in predicting recurrence for various cancers, with those utilizing multimodal data sources showing increasing promise. We developed a DL-based predictive model with attention mechanisms, gLioma recUrreNce Attention-based classifieR (LUNAR), to predict early vs. late glioma recurrence using clinical, mutation, and mRNA-expression data from patients with primary grade II-IV gliomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and, as an external validation set, the Glioma Longitudinal Analysis Consortium (GLASS). Our model outperforms traditional ML models and non-attention counterparts, achieving area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 82.84% and 82.54% on the TCGA and GLASS datasets, respectively.

The exosome complex (EXOSC) family plays a crucial role in RNA metabolism, but its significance in HNSC remains poorly understood. We performed a comprehensive multi-omics analysis integrating data from TCGA, GEO, CPTAC, and the Human Protein Atlas to investigate the expression, prognostic value, and immune relevance of EXOSC genes in HNSC. We conducted differential expression analysis, survival analysis (OS, DSS, PFI), ROC curve evaluation, and clinicopathological correlation studies. Genetic alterations were examined using cBioPortal. Gene co-expression and enrichment analyses were used to elucidate potential molecular functions, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed via GeneMANIA. Immune infiltration, immune checkpoint correlations, and RNA modification associations were assessed using ssGSEA, Spearman correlation, and RNA modification databases. Experimental validation was performed by qRT-PCR in HNSC and normal cell lines. All EXOSC family members were significantly upregulated in HNSC tissues and cell lines. ROC analysis demonstrated favorable diagnostic potential, particularly for EXOSC2 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.910). Elevated expression of EXOSC2, EXOSC3, EXOSC8, and EXOSC9 was significantly associated with poor OS, DSS, and PFI. High expression of EXOSC2, EXOSC4, EXOSC5, and EXOSC9 correlated with advanced clinical stage, lymphovascular invasion, and poor therapeutic outcomes. cBioPortal analysis revealed EXOSC4 had the highest genetic alteration frequency (8%), primarily due to amplification. Immune infiltration analysis showed EXOSC gene expression was significantly correlated with various immune cell populations and immune checkpoint molecules, especially EXOSC3, EXOSC9, and EXOSC10. Functional enrichment and PPI network analyses indicated that EXOSC family genes participate in RNA metabolism, exoribonuclease activity, and immune-related pathways. A prognostic risk model based on EXOSC co-expressed genes demonstrated strong predictive performance for patient survival. Our study reveals that EXOSC family genes are significantly dysregulated in HNSC and are associated with tumor progression, prognosis, immune microenvironment modulation, and RNA modification. These findings highlight the potential of EXOSC members as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and suggest their relevance as therapeutic targets in HNSC.",

To explore the clinical actionability of ERCC2 mutations, we assembled a multinational cohort of 2,012 individuals with bladder cancer and applied the highly quantitative CRISPR-Select assay to functionally profile recurrent ERCC2 mutations. We also developed a single-allele editing version of CRISPR-Select to assess heterozygous missense variants in their native context. From the cohort, 506 ERCC2 mutations were identified, with 93% being heterozygous missense variants. CRISPR-Select pinpointed deleterious, cisplatin-sensitizing mutations, particularly within the conserved helicase domains. Importantly, single-allele editing revealed that heterozygous helicase-domain mutations markedly increased cisplatin sensitivity. Integration with clinical data confirmed that these mutations were associated with improved response to platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Comparison with computational algorithms showed substantial discrepancies, highlighting the importance of precision functional assays for interpreting mutation effects in clinically relevant contexts.

In this study, we demonstrated that the RNA-regulatory functions of NOC1 are conserved in vertebrates, where the reduction of CEBPZ, the homolog of NOC1, leads to the accumulation of unprocessed 45S pre-rRNA, a reduction in protein synthesis, and inhibition of cell growth. Gene Ontology and bioinformatic analyses of CEBPZ, NOC2L and NOC3L in tumors highlight a significant correlation between their expression and processes that regulate rRNA processing and ribosomal maturation. Moreover, comparative analysis of TCGA datasets from tumor databases revealed that CEBPZ, NOC2L and NOC3L exhibit contrasting expression patterns across tumor types. This context-dependent behavior suggests that overexpression of these proteins might promote tumor growth, whereas reduced expression could exert tumor-suppressive effects, underscoring their complex and unexpected regulatory roles in cancer.",

          "abstract": "The N-formyl peptide receptor family (FPRs) is implicated in the progression of diverse cancer types, yet studies specifically exploring their roles in breast cancer remain scarce. A comprehensive analysis integrating bulk RNA-seq transcriptomics, methylomics, single-cell transcriptomics, and spatial single-cell transcriptomics data was conducted to elucidate the distinctive characteristics of FPRs in breast cancer. This study particularly focused on delineating the e xpression profiles of FPR3 across distinct breast cancer subtypes, while systematically investigating its prognostic implications and association with macrophage polarization patterns in breast cancer patients. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis was performed to screen potential therapeutic compounds targeting FPR3, providing insights into its druggability. Notably, FPR3 was found to be highly expressed in macrophages within breast cancer tissues, with a notably elevated level in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes, both of which are associated with poor prognosis. FPR3 expression inversely correlates with promoter methylation levels. Further analysis of pan-cancer immune infiltration patterns uncovered a striking association between FPR3 and macrophage infiltration, as well as their polarization status. Knockdown of FPR3 expression in macrophages markedly enhanced the expression of IL6, TNF-\u03b1, and TGF-\u03b2, while significantly reducing IL10 levels, indicative of a shift towards an M1-like macrophage phenotype. Through computational molecular docking analyses, Otamixaban and Rivaroxaban emerged as promising candidate inhibitors of FPR3. These findings underscore the profound infiltration of FPR3\u2009+\u2009macrophages in breast cancer patients with adverse prognoses, highlighting FPR3 as a potential therapeutic target for intervening breast cancer aggressiveness.",

Although most cervical cancer cells express HPV-related oncoproteins, some do not. Additionally, neoantigens worth attracting attention for cervical cancer (CC) may hold the potential for breakthroughs in the development of cervical cancer vaccines. A comprehensive computational analysis was conducted based on the tumor genome, transcriptome, and proteome data from 284 cervical cancer samples obtained from the TCGA database. Frequently mutated genes were identified. The levels of immune cell infiltration were analyzed using RNA-seq data, high-frequency mutated genes were identified as candidate genes that were significantly related to immune infiltration. Focusing on MHC class I epitopes recognized by CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells, we predicted potential neoantigen peptides using the NetMHCpan-4.0 and NetCTL-1.2 algorithms. To further confirm the immunogenicity of the synthesized peptides, we performed flow cytometry and real-time PCR in vivo to examine markers of T cell activation and cytotoxicity. We also stimulated PBMC from patients with the corresponding HLA type with the synthesized peptides using an ELISpot assay. We identified 30 highly mutated genes, among which TTN, PRKDC, PCLO, MUC17, HUWE1, RYR2, and CREBBP positively correlated with immune cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment. PCLO exhibited higher protein expression in tumor tissues than in the corresponding normal tissues, making it a potential tumor antigen. The PCLO peptides SISRFTLEK and LSEAGHFFY exhibited the highest predicted scores among the cancer antigens and strong immunogenicity in vivo. Our analysis highlights the potential of PCLO as a candidate gene for enhancing immune cell infiltration and activating immune responses in tumors. The peptides SISRFTLEK (PCLO<sup>L4169F</sup>) and LSEAGHFFY (PCLO<sup>A3000S</sup>) are promising targets for tumor vaccines.",

In this study, we aimed to identify and functionally validate novel hub genes associated with OC progression. We integrated four GEO microarray datasets (GSE54388, GSE40595, GSE18521, and GSE12470) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between OC and healthy tissues using the limma package. A total of 22 common DEGs were identified, of which four-SNRPA1, LSM4, TMED10, and PROM2-emerged as hub genes based on PPI network centrality. Expression analyses using TCGA data and RT-qPCR confirmed the significant upregulation of these genes in OC samples. Promoter methylation analysis showed hypomethylation in tumors, while ROC analysis revealed high diagnostic accuracy (AUC\u2009=\u20091.0). Although these genes were not significantly associated with overall survival in meta-analysis, they were strongly involved in oncogenic pathways such as EMT, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Predicted miRNAs (e.g., hsa-miR-1178-5p and hsa-miR-31-5p) targeting hub genes were significantly downregulated in OC cell lines. Immune analysis indicated that hub gene expression was correlated with immune subtypes, checkpoint inhibitors, and reduced immune infiltration. Drug sensitivity analysis suggested that high expression of TMED10 and PROM2 may confer susceptibility to chemotherapeutic agents. Functional assays following siRNA-mediated knockdown of TMED10 and PROM2 in A2780 and OVCAR3 cells revealed significant reductions in proliferation, colony formation, and migration. These findings highlight SNRPA1, LSM4, TMED10, and PROM2 as potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets in OC, warranting further investigation for clinical translation.",

Furthermore, we sought to determine the SLC2A1 function in LUAD initiation and progression through in vivo and in vitro experiments. A comprehensive bioinformatics analysis was conducted utilizing online tools and software, including R packages, Gene Set Cancer Analysis (GSCA), cBio Cancer Genomics Portal (cBioPortal), GeneMANIA, STRING, and Xiantao Academic Online databases, to assess the functional implications of the SLC2A gene family in LUAD. Concurrently, in vivo and in vitro experiments at the cellular and animal levels were conducted to ascertain the effects of SLC2A1 gene knockout on LUAD development. Compared to normal tissues, the SLC2A gene family exhibited significant upregulation across various tumor types, including LUAD, with a low mutation frequency in LUAD. SLC2A1 and SLC2A7 emerged as prognostic biomarkers for LUAD. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed high diagnostic accuracy of SLC2A1 for LUAD. A significant negative correlation was observed between SLC2A1 expression and DNA methylation levels in LUAD, and the gene was closely linked to cellular processes such as cell nuclear division, DNA replication, and metabolism. Moreover, SLC2A1 expression was strongly linked to immune infiltration and regulation across different tumor types. In vitro and in vivo experiments showcased that SLC2A1 inhibition significantly hampered LUAD A549 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion capabilities, as well as tumor growth in nude mice. Finally, our study demonstrated that reduced SLC2A1 expression influenced the expression of molecules within the P53 signaling pathway. This study elucidates the functional role of the SLC2A gene family in the pathogenesis of LUAD, underscoring the importance of SLC2A1 in LUAD diagnosis, prognosis, and immune response, and presenting SLC2A1 as a promising biomarker for LUAD.",

We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of 11 cohorts with validation in two independent cohorts. The identified variants were tested for effects on other hepatobiliary endpoints, and on incident HCC stratified by underlying risk factors. Mendelian randomization was used to assess the causal effects of a range of traits on the risk of HCC. In meta-analyses totaling 6,540 cases and 2,096,759 controls, we identified 10 associations with HCC, of which five (in <i>KLF15</i>, <i>HSD17B13</i>, <i>APOE</i>, <i>HFE</i>, and <i>MTARC1</i>) have not previously been implicated in HCC at genome-wide statistical significance. Known associations in <i>PNPLA3</i>, <i>TM6SF2</i>, <i>TERT</i>, <i>IFNL4</i>, and <i>HLA-DP1</i> were confirmed. All associations except <i>KLF15</i> were validated in independent cohorts totaling 7,630 cases and 733,689 controls. The largest per-allele effect was seen for <i>TM6SF2</i> (beta = 0.61) followed by <i>PNPLA3</i> (0.55), <i>HFE</i> (0.45), <i>IFNL4</i> (0.31), <i>APOE</i> (0.27), <i>HSD17B13</i>, <i>HLA-DP1</i>, and <i>TERT</i> (all 0.21), and <i>MTARC1</i> (0.17). The identified variants had comparable effects on incident HCC in individuals with prevalent obesity, a high alcohol intake, diabetes, or cirrhosis. Mendelian randomization analyses confirmed the causal role of obesity in HCC. We found strong correlations between genetic effects on HCC and hepatic steatosis (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.75), and HCC and cirrhosis (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.69), whereas only three loci (<i>APOE</i>, <i>HFE</i>, and <i>TERT</i>) had concordant effects on HCC and biliary tract cancer. We identified and validated nine genetic variants associated with an increased risk of HCC development. The genetic underpinnings of HCC remain largely unknown. In this genome-wide association meta-analysis totaling 6,540 cases with HCC and 2.1 million controls, we identified and validated nine genetic loci to associate with the risk of HCC.

However, their contribution to colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) pathogenesis remains poorly defined. This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic relevance of GNAI genes in COAD through integrated in silico and in vitro analyses. mRNA and protein expression profiles of GNAI1, GNAI2, and GNAI3 were analyzed using TCGA, OncoDB, HPA databases, and RT-qPCR analysis across COAD cell lines. Genetic and epigenetic alterations were assessed using UALCAN, cBioPortal, and GSCA databases. Prognostic significance was evaluated through Kaplan\u2013Meier survival and GENT2 databases. Potential miRNA regulators were identified via TargetScan and quantified using TaqMan assays. Immune interactions, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity were examined using TISIDB and GSCA platforms. Functional effects of GNAI1 and GNAI2 overexpression were tested in SW480 and HCT116 cell lines using proliferation, colony formation, and wound healing assays. GNAI1, GNAI2, and GNAI3 were significantly downregulated in both COAD tissues and cell lines. This downregulation correlated with promoter hypermethylation, CNV deletions, and reduced patient survival. ROC analysis indicated better diagnostic potential, particularly for GNAI2 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.83). Pathway analysis revealed suppression of DNA damage and cell cycle regulatory pathways and activation of EMT-related signaling. Upregulated miRNAs\u2014hsa-miR-133a-3p-1, hsa-miR-138-5p, and hsa-miR-141-3p\u2014were identified as direct regulators, exhibiting strong diagnostic capacity. Immune profiling showed that GNAI genes were differentially expressed across immune subtypes, negatively correlated with immune inhibitors, and positively associated with stimulators. Overexpression of GNAI1 and GNAI2 significantly inhibited COAD cell proliferation, clonogenic potential, and migration. This study reveals the tumor-suppressive function of GNAI1, GNAI2, and GNAI3 in COAD through genetic, epigenetic, and miRNA-mediated regulation. Their downregulation is associated with poor prognosis, altered immune landscape, and therapy resistance.

Unlike MSI-H gastric cancer, GS and CIN subtypes exhibit immunologically inert microenvironments and demonstrate minimal response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), necessitating novel strategies to overcome immunotherapy resistance. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM6 as inversely associated with MSI-H status. TRIM6-knockout murine models and subcutaneous tumors were subjected to flow cytometry, RNA sequencing, immunoblotting, and ubiquitination assays to characterize tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), pathway activation, and TRIM6-mediated regulation of the cGAS-STING axis. Hypermethylation-mediated TRIM6 downregulation distinguished MSI-H from microsatellite stable (MSS) gastric cancers. Clinically, TRIM6 expression inversely correlated with cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) infiltration and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapeutic efficacy. Mechanistically, TRIM6 catalyzed K27-linked polyubiquitination of cGAS, triggering its proteasomal degradation and consequent suppression of the cGAS-STING pathway. TRIM6 ablation enhanced CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes infiltration via cGAS-mediated innate immune response and synergized with anti-PD-L1 therapy in MSS gastric tumors.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying UCEC is crucial for developing effective diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies. Immune-related genes, such as COL1A1, ITGB1, THY1, and PDGFRA, have been implicated in various cancers, but their roles in UCEC remain underexplored. In this study, we investigate the roles of these genes in the development and progression of UCEC. Using both in silico and in vitro approaches, we found that these genes were dysregulated in UCEC. Our results revealed the downregulation of COL1A1, ITGB1, THY1, and PDGFRA in UCEC compared to normal tissues. Further, promoter methylation analysis showed increased methylation of these genes in UCEC. Survival analysis highlighted their potential as prognostic markers, with lower expression linked to poor patient survival. Additionally, genetic alteration analysis demonstrated mutations in these genes across UCEC patients. Our results also showed that overexpression of COL1A1 in KLE and HEC-1B cells significantly reduced cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration, indicating that COL1A1 overexpression impacts critical cellular behaviors in UCEC. Finally, we explored the therapeutic potential of targeting these genes, suggesting that they may offer valuable insights for personalized treatment strategies in UCEC. This study identifies COL1A1, ITGB1, THY1, and PDGFRA as crucial regulators of UCEC progression, with altered expression linked to tumor behavior and patient survival. Overexpression of COL1A1 impaired cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. Future research should focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms of these genes, exploring their therapeutic targeting in preclinical models, and validating their clinical potential as biomarkers in larger patient cohorts to improve treatment strategies for UCEC.",

          "abstract": "Liver cancer continues to be a significant challenge among malignancies today. Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the cancers that exhibits a marked upregulation of AKR1B10, an enzyme involved in cellular metabolism. The advancement of HCC treatment indicates that immunotherapy and molecular targeted therapies exhibit potential efficacy. However, the primary targets for liver cancer are not yet well-defined. Therefore, this study investigates the mechanism of AKR1B10 to assess its potential as a prognostic biomarker in liver cancer. Genetic changes, genomic expression, and methylation analyses were sourced from the TCGA, CPTAC, UALCAN, HPA, cBioPortal, and MethSurv databases. The gene expression is validated by qPCR. The diagnostic and prognostic significance of AKR1B10 in LIHC was assessed using data from ROC analysis and KM-plotter. Functional analyses were performed utilizing the GeneMANIA and STRING databases, along with gene-gene and PPI networks, GO terms, and KEGG pathway analyses. The relationship with immune escape was explored through analyses conducted using the TIMER, TISIDB, and GEPIA databases. Additionally, GSCALite was utilized to analyze drug sensitivity in relation to AKR1B10 expression in tumors. AKR1B10 expression was found to be statistically significantly higher in HCC cells than in their corresponding normal control cells, according to qPCR analysis. ROC analysis identified AKR1B10 as a novel biomarker for diagnosing LIHC. Univariate Cox regression analysis indicated AKR1B10 association with poor LIHC patient prognosis. Integrative analyses, including genetic alterations, gene-gene interactions, PPI networks, and enrichment analyses, support a novel role for AKR1B10 in HCC progression. Hypermethylation of AKR1B10 at various CpG sites was associated with improved or diminished OS in LIHC, and AKR1B10 exhibited a robust correlation with the top 25 genes that were either hypo- or hypermethylated. Furthermore, the findings indicated that AKR1B10 may affect the TME and is associated with immune checkpoints. This study\u2019s comprehensive analyses indicate AKR1B10 as a novel biomarker for LIHC.

We conducted a systematic review of next-generation sequencing based observational cohort studies of somatic breast cancer genomes in women of African ancestry, from January 2004 to September 2024. Extracted genomic features-driver mutations, copy-number alterations, structural-variants, tumour mutational burden and mutational signatures-were contrasted against TCGA's Black/African American and White reference cohorts. Ten studies from seven countries met inclusion criteria. Main findings were higher rate of triple-negative breast cancer, higher rate of TP53 and lower rate of PIK3CA mutations compared with TCGA White. African tumours also exhibited elevated TMB, CNA and SV burden. Mutational signatures revealed enriched homologous recombination deficiency and APOBEC activity. Despite small, heterogeneous cohorts and regional gaps, these distinct somatic landscapes suggest PARP, PI3K and immunotherapy targets. Coordinated sequencing efforts are urgently needed to drive precision oncology in Africa.",

Rap1 Interacting Factor 1 (RIF1) plays a crucial role in genome stability and is implicated in cancer pathogenesis. Cells express two RIF1 splice variants, RIF1-Long and RIF1-Short, which differ in their ability to protect cells from DNA replication stress. Here, we investigate differential expression and splicing of RIF1 in cancer cell lines following replication stress and in patients using matched normal and tumour data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Overall <i>RIF1</i> expression is altered in several cancer types, with increased transcript levels in colon and lung cancers. <i>RIF1</i> also exhibits distinct splicing patterns, particularly in specific breast cancer subtypes. In Luminal A (LumA), Luminal B (LumB), and HER2-enriched breast cancers (HER2E), <i>RIF1</i> Exon 31 tends to be excluded, favouring RIF1-Short expression and correlating with poorer clinical outcomes. These breast cancer subtypes also tend to exclude other short exons, suggesting length-dependent splicing dysregulation. Basal breast cancer also shows exon exclusion, but unlike other subtypes, it shows no short-exon bias. Surprisingly, however, in basal breast cancer, <i>RIF1</i> Exon 31 is not consistently excluded, which may impact prognosis since RIF1-Long protects against replication stress.",

Here, we establish a causal link between SG formation and oxaliplatin resistance in GC. Notably, we identify a key SG nucleator, namely, ubiquitin-associated protein 2-like (UBAP2L), as a previously unrecognized critical factor in mediating oxaliplatin resistance. UBAP2L-nucleated SG-mediated inhibition of apoptosis is associated with the recruitment of receptor of activated protein C kinase 1 (RACK1), a known promoter of apoptosis, to these entities. Transcriptional upregulation of UBAP2L is enhanced by oxaliplatin-induced phosphorylation and activation of heat shock factor protein 1 (HSF1) via AKT. Inhibiting either SG or HSF1 significantly overcomes oxaliplatin resistance in vivo. These findings demonstrate that UBAP2L-nucleated SGs play a vital role in mediating oxaliplatin resistance, with elevated SG levels emerging as a promising therapeutic target for overcoming this resistance.",

          "abstract": "Cell death modalities play crucial roles in cancer evolution and therapeutic responses. Among various mechanisms, necrosis by sodium overload (NECSO) is a newly recognized process initiated by disruptions in Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis, manifesting through osmotic stress, energy depletion, and immunogenic damage. The TRPM4 gene, which encodes a calcium-activated and sodium-selective ion channel, has surfaced as a significant regulator connecting ionic metabolism with oncogenic pathways. Given these insights, our study aims to comprehensively analyze the expression and implications of TRPM4 across diverse cancer types to elucidate its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target. We conducted a systematic investigation of TRPM4 across 33 cancer types defined by the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), integrating transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenetic, and clinical datasets from TCGA, GTEx, and Human Protein Atlas (HPA). We employed differential expression analyses, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and survival analyses, alongside mutation and methylation assessments. Furthermore, we explored TRPM4's immunological aspects through immune infiltration analyses. Our analyses revealed significant TRPM4 overexpression in several tumors, such as bladder (BLCA), cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), and ovarian cancer (OV), whilst being downregulated in others like kidney clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Notably, TRPM4 expression correlated with overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free interval, highlighting its prognostic value. Furthermore, promoter methylation and mutation patterns elucidated the mechanisms underlying TRPM4 dysregulation, and immune infiltration analyses suggested its involvement in tumor immune evasion. This investigation highlights TRPM4's dual role in mediating sodium-induced cell death and modulating the tumor microenvironment, proposing it as a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, though its association with demographic and pathological characteristics appears limited and tumor-type specific. Given its import in various malignancies and potential therapeutic implications through ion channel-focused strategies, TRPM4 warrants further exploration as a target for precision oncology.",

          "abstract": "Bladder cancer (BLCA) is the second most common urologic cancer in the United States and worldwide and mostly affects the aging population. Despite several ongoing clinical trials, treatment paradigms for BLCA have not changed significantly. Here, we investigated the expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 4 (TRPV4) in patients with BLCA and its role in calcium influx, cell proliferation, and migration using normal human urothelial cells and BLCA cells. Bioinformatic analysis of the University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Data Analysis Portal and cBioPortal databases revealed that TRPV4 expression is significantly higher in human BLCA tissues than in normal adjacent tissues. Furthermore, TRPV4 expression was markedly elevated in early-stage BLCA and upregulated in muscle-invasive bladder cancer tissues. TRPV4 is expressed in both normal urothelial (SV-HUC-1) and BLCA (T-24) cells, and functional assays demonstrated enhanced TRPV4-mediated calcium influx in T-24 compared with SV-HUC-1 cells. T-24 cells exhibited higher spreading on extracellular matrix gels with increasing stiffness (0.2, 8, and 50 kPa) and exhibited a migratory phenotype compared to SV-HUC-1 cells. Pharmacological inhibition of TRPV4 significantly reduced proliferation and migration in T-24 cells but had minimal effects on normal cells. Finally, treatment with cisplatin significantly reduced TRPV4 protein levels and TRPV4-mediated calcium influx in chemosensitive UM-UC-3 cells but remained unchanged in chemoresistant T-24 cells, suggesting a potential role of TRPV4 in chemoresistance. In conclusion, TRPV4 may contribute to BLCA progression by regulating cell proliferation and migration and may impart resistance to chemotherapy. Targeting TRPV4 could present a novel therapeutic approach for managing BLCA progression and overcoming chemoresistance. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study identified transient receptor potential vanilloid type 4 (TRPV4) as a critical driver of bladder cancer (BLCA) progression. TRPV4 gene expression is elevated in both early-stage and muscle-invasive BLCA tissues. Importantly, TRPV4 inhibition selectively reduces BLCA growth and motility. Furthermore, TRPV4 is downregulated by cisplatin in chemosensitive but not chemoresistant BLCA cells, underscoring its key role in bladder cancer chemoresistance. These findings position TRPV4 as a therapeutic target for enhancing BLCA treatment and overcoming drug resistance.",

It also seeks to uncover non-invasive radiomic markers related to poor survival outcome for improved prognosis and treatment planning. We analysed pre-operative MRI scans and genomic data from 123 GBM patients (TCIA and TCGA). Tumor locations were determined using our in-house tool, \"tumorVQ\", followed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis based on tumor position. Genomic analysis included somatic mutations, copy number variations, fusion genes, and differential gene expression to identify factors linked to poor survival. We extracted radiomic features from T1ce MRI scans using pyRadiomics to analyse their relationship with survival outcomes. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed worse survival for tumors in the parietal lobe compared to other lobes, especially frontal lobe tumors. Genomic analysis revealed high prevalence of PTEN mutations, and exclusive fusion genes FGFR3-TACC3 and EGFR-SEPT14 in parietal lobe tumors. Differential gene expression showed upregulation of PITX2, HOXB13, and DTHD1, linked to tumor progression, while ALOX15 downregulation increased relapse risk. Copy number alterations, like LINC00290 deletions, were associated with aggressive parietal lobe tumors. Radiomic features, lower GLDM DependanceEntropy (LLL) and higher FirstOrder Mean (HLL), were strongly linked to increase risk. This study highlights poor survival outcomes in GBM patients with parietal lobe tumors. Key genetic alterations, such as PTEN mutations and fusion genes, drive tumor progression and chemoresistance in parietal lobe tumors. The association between radiomic features and survival indicates their potential as non-invasive prognostic biomarkers, which could aid in personalized treatment and improved patient management.",

This study aimed to clarify the relationship between NUDT18 and endometrial cancer (EC) and whether it is a prognostic factor for EC. We first examined the function of NUDT18 through The Cancer Genome Atlas public data and Human Protein Atlas databases, and then immunohistochemical staining was conducted to compare the expression of NUDT18 in normal endometrium and EC tissues of different stages. Finally, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify the signaling pathways regulated by NUDT18 in EC. We found that NUDT18 expression was considerably elevated in EC tissues relative to physiological endometrium (P<0.001). However, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that high NUDT18 expression in EC was associated with a longer overall survival (OS). Immunohistochemistry results showed that NUDT18 expression was upregulated in tissues of early-stage EC compared with normal endometrial tissues and gradually decreased with the increase of stage. NUDT18 expression was significantly associated with Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, histologic grade, and myometrial invasion (all P values <0.05). GSEA revealed that the biological pathways that were differentially downregulated in the NUDT18-high expression phenotype were cell cycle, the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, RNA degradation, adherens junction, basal transcription factors, and DNA replication. In addition, NUDT18 DNA copy gain and the downregulation of miR-758-3p exhibited a correlation with the upregulation of NUDT18 in EC, and NUDT18 expression was significantly reduced in tumors with the TP53 mutation. The analysis of immune cell abundance indicated a substantial increase in immune infiltration in EC tissues with high NUDT18 expression. NUDT18 was upregulated in EC relative to normal endometrium, and its expression inversely correlated with tumor stage. Notably, higher NUDT18 expression predicted improved OS, highlighting its clinical significance as a marker of favorable prognosis in EC.",

By mining genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen data sets, we identified nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (<i>NAMPT</i>) on 7q22.3 as a specific susceptibility in 81.5% of -7/del(7q) malignancies. Human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines with partial loss of <i>NAMPT</i> and primary samples from patients with -7 AML demonstrated heightened sensitivity to the NAMPT inhibitor KPT-9274 compared to control samples. Notably, NAMPT inhibitors were equally effective in <i>NAMPT</i>-deficient samples with <i>TP53</i> loss. Furthermore, combining NAMPT and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, which augment DNA damage, resulted in synergistic therapeutic effects in <i>NAMPT</i>-deficient AML cells. These findings indicate that <i>NAMPT</i> heterozygosity is a therapeutic vulnerability in high-risk myeloid malignancies with -7/del(7q) and recommend <i>NAMPT</i> levels as a biomarker for NAMPT inhibitor sensitivity.

We used methylation profiling and showed that different morphologies have specific methylation profiles. Furthermore, our spatial transcriptomic approach, using 10\u00d7 Genomics Visium and trajectory analysis, evidenced that spindle cells form a transition between the originating carcinoma of no-special type (NST) and pleomorphic regions, with osteoid differentiation likely to be an end-stage fate of the chondroid growth pattern, supporting the conversion model of lineage differentiation.

The N-glycosyltransferase asparagine-linked glycosylation 3 homolog (ALG3), a rate-limiting enzyme during glycan biosynthesis, catalyzes the addition of the first mannose to glycans in an alpha-1,3 linkage. Here we show that ALG3 is phosphorylated downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway in both growth factor-stimulated cells and PI3K/AKT-hyperactive cancer cells. AKT directly phosphorylates ALG3 in the amino terminal region at Ser11/Ser13. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated depletion of ALG3 leads to improper glycan formation and induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress, the unfolded protein response, and impaired cell proliferation. Phosphorylation of ALG3 at Ser11/Ser13 is required for glycosylation of cell surface receptors EGFR, HER3, and E-cadherin. These findings provide a direct link between PI3K/AKT signaling and protein glycosylation in cancer cells.",

However, the clinical significance of catenin beta-1 (CTNNB1) comutations remains unclear. This study evaluated outcomes of patients with EGFR/CTNNB1 comutated NSCLC in a dual-center cohort. A retrospective analysis of 1,804 patients with NSCLC undergoing next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 2019-2024 at University Hospital W\u00fcrzburg (single-center cohort, including 15 patients with EGFR/CTNNB1 comutations) was complemented with patients with EGFR/CTNNB1 comutated NSCLC receiving first-line osimertinib at the Thoraxklinik Heidelberg (n = 11) to extend and validate initial findings. We assessed clinical outcomes after first-line osimertinib therapy in 90 EGFR-mutated patients with CTNNB1 wild-type (wt) status and 23 with CTNNB1 comutation. CTNNB1 mutations were identified in 2.0% (36/1,804) of all patients with NSCLC from the single-center cohort, with 41.7% of these also harboring EGFR mutations. Among EGFR-mutant tumors, 7.7% (15/195) exhibited concurrent CTNNB1 mutations. In the dual-center cohort, the objective response rate with first-line osimertinib was 74.4% in CTNNB1-wt (n = 90) and 65.0% in CTNNB1-mutant patients (n = 23; <i>P</i> = .38). Notably, CTNNB1 mutations were associated with significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS; hazard ratio [HR], 0.32; <i>P</i> < .001) and overall survival (OS; HR, 0.33; <i>P</i> = .003). Multivariate analysis confirmed CTNNB1 comutation as an independent prognostic factor for improved PFS (HR, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.69]; <i>P</i> = .004) and OS (HR, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.10 to 0.65]; <i>P</i> = .004). Additionally, CTNNB1 mutations correlated with lower PD-L1 expression (<i>P</i> = .001) and TP53-wt status (<i>P</i> < .001). CTNNB1 comutations are associated with lower PD-L1 expression and TP53-wt status, correlating with improved outcomes in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC undergoing osimertinib therapy. These results suggest that CTNNB1 comutations may serve as a favorable prognostic biomarker in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Additional prospective studies are warranted to validate these results.",

Our results reveal the regional biases in perturbed pathways, such as PI3K-Akt in Chinese patients and GPCR in American patients with bladder cancer. Subtype comparisons highlight the mTOR signaling in lung adenocarcinoma and the FoxO signaling in lung squamous cell carcinoma. Pediatric-adult comparisons emphasize the enrichment of Ras signaling in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia and PAK signaling in pediatric glioblastoma, respectively. Risk factor associations further link Notch-mediated pathways to alcohol consumption and CDKN-regulated pathways to obesity-related cancers.

          "abstract": "The DNA-incorporating nucleoside analogs azacytidine (AZA) and decitabine (DEC) have clinical efficacy in blood cancers, yet the precise mechanism by which these agents kill cancer cells has remained unresolved - specifically, whether their anti-tumor activity arises from conventional DNA damage or DNA hypomethylation via DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) inhibition. This incomplete mechanistic understanding has limited their broader therapeutic application, particularly in solid tumors, where early clinical trials showed limited efficacy. Here, through the assessment of drug sensitivity in over 600 human cancer models and comparison to a non-DNA-damaging DNMT1 inhibitor (GSK-3685032), we establish DNA hypomethylation, rather than DNA damage, as the primary killing mechanism of AZA and DEC across diverse cancer types. In further support of an epigenetic killing mechanism, CRISPR drug modifier screens identified a core set of chromatin regulators, most notably the histone deubiquitinase USP48, as AZA and DEC protective factors. We show that USP48 is recruited to newly hypomethylated CpG islands and deubiquitinates non-canonical histones, establishing USP48 as a key molecular link between the two components of epigenetic gene regulation: DNA methylation and chromatin modification. Furthermore, loss of <i>USP48</i>, which occurs naturally through biallelic deletions in human cancers, sensitized both hematologic and solid tumors to DNMT1 inhibition <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Our findings elucidate the epigenetic mechanism of action of AZA and DEC and identify a homeostatic link between DNA methylation and chromatin state, revealing new therapeutic opportunities for DNMT1 inhibitors in solid tumors.",

However, the biological role of MCM6 has not been reported in pan-cancer. In present study, a pan-cancer analysis of MCM6 was performed using multiple databases and online websites. The relationship between MCM6 and DNA methylation, prognosis, immune infiltration and immunotherapy response was investigated. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression models were performed to construct prognostic risk signature for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) based on MCM6-related cell cycle genes (MrCCGs). Meanwhile, the biological function of MCM6 in lung adenocarcinoma was further verified through in vivo and in vitro experiments. MCM6 is highly expressed and is a prognostic risk factor in most tumors. MCM6 expression is significantly associated with the infiltration of immune cells (especially MDSCs) in a variety of tumors. The risk signature based on MrCCGs can reliably predict the prognosis of LUAD (AUC\u2009=\u20090.739). Immunohistochemical staining showed that the expression of MCM6 is higher in lung adenocarcinoma tissues compared with para-cancer tissues and is associated with the poor prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients. In vitro, MCM6 knockdown inhibited proliferation, invasion, and migration of A549 and H1299 cells, and blocked the G1 phase of the A549 cell cycle. In vivo, knockdown of MCM6 inhibited the growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice. The study suggests that MCM6 may be a potential prognostic and immunological biomarker in many cancers.",

Using quantitative proteomics and multiomics, we discovered 21 dysregulated proteins in early-stage EGFR-WT LUAD, identifying myeloid-derived growth factor (MYDGF) as a key candidate biomarker. Elevated MYDGF levels in tissue (<i>n</i> = 117) and serum (<i>n</i> = 196) correlated significantly with cancer stage in EGFR-WT patients but not EGFR-MT cases. Notably, a higher tumor-to-normal MYDGF ratio predicted a favorable prognosis in early-stage EGFR-WT LUAD. Functional studies demonstrated that MYDGF exerts distinct roles in cell viability and migration depending on its cellular localization and the invasive potential of cancer cells. Specifically, secreted MYDGF promoted a protumorigenic phenotype, whereas excess intracellular MYDGF appeared to suppress the oncogenic capacity of aggressive cancer cells. MYDGF knockdown and subsequent proteomic analysis provided further insights into these context-dependent functions. These findings highlight EGFR status- and stage-specific proteomic profiles in LUAD, emphasizing the importance of context-dependent biomarker assessment for personalized treatment strategies.",

MLL3 loss stabilized the transcription factor HIF1\u03b1, which increased secretion of the chemokine CCL2 by tumor cells and promoted recruitment of CCR2<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (Treg) cells.

The loss of SOX10, a neural crest lineage-specific transcription factor, leads to phenotypic switching from a proliferative cell state to an invasive, drug-tolerant cell state. SOX10-deficient cells are able to persist during immunotherapy treatment, highlighting the need to characterize the factors that regulate immune evasion downstream of SOX10 loss. In this study, we found that SOX10-deficient melanoma cell lines and patient samples express elevated levels of TGM2, a transglutaminase family member. TGM2 upregulation in SOX10 knockout cells was reversed by inhibition of epigenetic reader BET proteins. Knockdown of TGM2 did not affect the SOX10-deficient invasive cell state; however, overexpression of TGM2 in syngeneic melanomas promoted tumor onset in immunocompetent mice, but not in immunodeficient mice, suggesting an immune-mediated effect. TGM2 overexpression in melanoma was associated with decreased intratumoral CD4+ T cells, and depletion of CD4+ T cells abolished the tumor-promoting effect of TGM2. These data indicate that TGM2 is negatively regulated by SOX10 in melanoma and can promote an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The transglutaminase TGM2 is negatively associated with the neural crest lineage-specific transcription factor SOX10 and is an immunomodulatory protein in cutaneous melanoma.",

This study aimed to comprehensively analyze NPR3's role across multiple cancers, focusing on its potential as a prognostic biomarker, particularly in kidney cancer. A comprehensive pan-cancer study of NPR3 was conducted using 20 different databases and datasets. The study included differential expression analysis, competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival analysis, and correlation assessments of NPR3 with clinical characteristics, tumor purity, tumor genomics, tumor immunity, drug sensitivity, molecular docking, and signaling pathways. Additionally, using a cohort of 370 patients diagnosed with kidney neoplasms, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to assess NPR3 expression differences between tumor and normal tissues. The IHC cutoff point was determined using the \"surv_cutpoint\" function, followed by survival analysis. Multiple external datasets were used to validate the results. Cell-based experiments in 786-O, 769-P, and A-498 cell lines were further conducted. In pan-cancer, NPR3 was down-regulated in most of the tumor types, and ceRNA and PPI network were constructed. Moreover, NPR3 expression was significantly associated with the clinical prognosis and stages, tumor purity, genetic mutation, immune infiltration and signaling pathways and drug sensitivity. In kidney neoplasm, NPR3 was down-regulated, and higher expression was associated with a better prognosis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that NPR3 expression was protective factor for both OS (HR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.29-0.87, <i>p</i> = 0.013) and PFS (HR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.46-0.95, <i>p</i> = 0.024).

          "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malignancy, predominantly occurring in patients with underlying chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis. Organic anion transporter polypeptides (OATPs), encoded by SLCO genes, are one of the most important SLC subfamilies involved in the cellular uptake of drugs and endobiotic. OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1 gene), OATP1B3 (SLCO1B3 gene), and OATP2B1 (SLCO2B1 gene) are hepatic uptake transporters highly expressed in the liver. We aimed to systematically analyze expression levels of SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and SLCO2B1 and to investigate their prognostic role in predicting HCC clinical outcomes using open-source databases. A comparison of HCC and matched normal tissue gene and protein expression was performed using the TCGA and CPTAC datasets through UALCAN. The correlation between SLCO gene and protein expression with patient survival was evaluated using OncoLnc, KM-Plotter, and OSppc. SLCO genetic alterations in HCC were explored using cBioPortal. A protein-protein interaction map for SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and SLCO2B1 was also constructed using STRING. Gene and protein expression levels of SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and SLCO2B1 were significantly downregulated in HCC patients compared to normal counterparts. Clinically, the low gene expression of SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and SLCO2B1 was correlated with shorter survival rate in HCC patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis further confirmed that low protein levels of these transporters predicted poor prognosis for HCC patients. Analysis of the TCGA Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma dataset (<i>TCGA's Pan-</i>Cance<i>r</i> Atlas) revealed a low mutation and amplification frequency in HCC for SLCO1B1 (0.57% vs. 0.29%), SLCO1B3 (0.86% vs. 0.29%), and SLCO2B1 (0.57% vs. 0.86%), respectively. Network analysis highlighted non-random interconnectivity among SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and SLCO2B1. SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and SLCO2B1 are highly expressed in the <i>liver</i> and play key roles in many liver diseases. In <i>HCC patients</i>, the downregulation of SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and SLCO2B1 expression has been observed. SLCO genes such as SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and SLCO2B1 expression levels may also serve as prognostic predictive markers in HCC patients.",

However, the biological function of SLC4A11 in ovarian cancer (OC) is still unclear. This study explores the anti-tumor and biological activities of SLC4A11 in OC. The expression and function of SLC4A11 were evaluated in human OC cells and xenograft mice. SLC4A11 expression was evaluated using data from the TCGA-OV, GTEx, and GEO datasets. The genetic status of SLC4A11 was analyzed by the cBioPortal database. The data of expressional abundance, immunochemistry, and immunofluorescence were analyzed through the HPA database. The correlation between SLC4A11 and immune responses was analyzed with the CIBERSORT database, whereas therapeutic responses were analyzed with the CellMiner database. SLC4A11 was found to be highly expressed in OC tissues/cells and had a relationship with an unfavorable prognosis in patients with OC. The overexpressed SLC4A11 promoted OC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Reducing SLC4A11 caused the cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and triggered apoptosis. The in vivo study with a xenographic model revealed that the knockdown of SLC4A11 suppressed tumor growth. Subsequent bioinformatics analyses revealed that SLC4A11 expression was associated with immune responses and therapeutic drug sensitivity. These findings have illustrated the oncogenic role of SLC4A11 in OC. SLC4A11 is overexpressed and is correlated with poor prognosis in OC. SLC4A11 may be a targetable biomarker and has a potential value of application in treating patients with OC.",

          "abstract": "The p53 gene is vital in gliomagenesis. As a tumor suppressor, mutations in TP53 lead to disruptions in apoptosis, cellular senescence, and cell cycle arrest. Ongoing research presents conflicting results about the significance of TP53 mutations in gliomas, particularly in astrocytomas. Histopathologic grade is crucial for assessing tumor aggressiveness, prognosis, and therapy selection. Recent studies and the updated WHO classification emphasize molecular profiling as a key factor in astrocytic glial tumor classification. Furthermore, the high occurrence of p53 mutations in astrocytoma makes it a promising target for therapy in this type of tumor. This study investigates the association between p53 mutations and histopathologic grade in astrocytoma. The research subjects were patients diagnosed with astrocytoma of all grades in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded form between 2017 and 2022 at Dr. Sardjito Hospital in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the p53 mutation status. A 10% cut-off is applied to determine p53 immunopositivity. Statistical analysis assessed the correlation of p53 mutation with glioma grade. Our study includes 140 patients with astrocytoma, including 10 patients with grade 1, 21 patients with grade 2, 10 patients with grade 3, and 99 patients with grade 4. Our study found a significant correlation between TP53 mutations and histopathological grades in astrocytoma (p=0.001). We present analysis results using Spearman's correlation for bivariate relationships and ordinal regression for multivariate analysis. p53 mutations are associated with histopathologic grade in Astrocytoma. These findings underscore the importance of p53 in astrocytoma prognosis and therapy. Further research is necessary to support their role in advancing astrocytoma management and treatment.",

          "abstract": "Sarcomas represent a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal tumors that, despite accounting for only 1% of cancers worldwide, rank among the top five causes of cancer-related deaths in patients under 20 years old. Surgical resection remains the primary treatment for these malignancies, as effective systemic therapies are limited, particularly for high-grade disease. However, surgical outcomes are often compromised by incomplete resection, leading to high local and distal recurrence rates. Intraoperative molecular imaging has emerged as a promising approach to improve surgical outcomes but has been hindered by the lack of tumor-specific targeting agents. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP), selectively expressed by mesenchymal tumors and absent in healthy tissues, presents a promising target for fluorescence-guided cancer resections. We demonstrate that 41% of human sarcomas express FAP, with expression correlating with higher histologic grade. The FAP-S0456 optical tracer specifically bound to FAP-expressing sarcomas with minimal binding to normal tissues, exhibiting excellent tumor-to-background ratios (3.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.43). In vitro studies confirmed FAP-S0456's specificity for human FAP with a dissociation constant of approximately 10 nM. In murine xenograft models, the tracer accurately identified both primary tumors and pulmonary metastases of FAP-expressing sarcomas. Importantly, using needle confocal laser endomicroscopy, we demonstrated that FAP-S0456 enables real-time, single-cell visualization of metastatic tumor cells during surgery, including micrometastases not detected by conventional imaging. FAP-S0456 represents a promising molecular imaging agent for the detection and surgical removal of primary and metastatic sarcomas. Its high specificity for FAP-expressing tumor cells, favorable biodistribution profile, and ability to detect microscopic disease offer potential to improve complete surgical resection. These findings support the development of FAP-targeted fluorescence-guided surgery for sarcoma patients, which may lead to improved oncologic outcomes, particularly for those with pulmonary metastases where complete surgical clearance is critical for survival.",

However, due to diverse needs and the lack of standardized filtering criteria, the filtering strategies applied vary from study to study, often resulting in reduced efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility. Here, we present CaMutQC, a heuristic quality control and soft-filtering R/Bioconductor package designed specifically for CAMs. CaMutQC enables users to remove false positive mutations, select potential mutation candidates, and estimate Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) with a single line of code, using either default or customized parameters. A filter report and a code log can also be generated after the filtration process to facilitate reproducibility and comparison. The application of CaMutQC to a Whole-exome Sequencing (WES) benchmark dataset demonstrated its strong capability by eliminating 85.55\u202f% of false positive Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) while retaining 90.72\u202f% of true positive SNVs. Additionally, an additional 11.56\u202f% of true positive SNVs were rescued through CaMutQC's built-in union strategy. Similar results were observed for Insertions and Deletions (INDELs).

While killer cell lectin-like receptor G2 (KLRG2) exhibits oncogenic properties in other cancers, its clinical significance and mechanistic roles in EC are unknown. This study aims to systematically characterize KLRG2 expression in EC, evaluate its prognostic significance, decipher underlying molecular mechanisms, and explore its role in tumor immune microenvironment regulation. <b>Methods</b>: We performed integrated multi-omics analyses using TCGA-UCEC (n = 552), GTEx, and GEO cohorts (GSE106191), complemented by qPCR validation (14 EC vs. 14 normal samples). Prognostic models were constructed via Cox regression and time-dependent ROC analysis. Epigenetic regulation was assessed through methylation profiling (UALCAN/MethSurv), and immune correlations were evaluated using TIMER/ESTIMATE algorithms. <b>Results</b>: KLRG2 was significantly overexpressed in EC tissues compared to normal endometrium (<i>p</i> < 0.001), validated by immunohistochemistry and qPCR. High KLRG2 expression independently predicted worse overall survival (HR = 3.08, 95% CI = 1.92-4.96) and progression-free interval (HR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.37-2.87). Furthermore, elevated KLRG2 levels were significantly associated with advanced-stage disease (<i>p</i> < 0.001), deep myometrial invasion (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and high-grade histology (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Mechanistically, promoter hypomethylation was associated with KLRG2 overexpression (<i>p</i> < 0.001), while hypermethylation at three CpG sites (cg04915254, cg04520485, cg23104233) correlated with poor prognosis. Functional enrichment linked KLRG2 to cell cycle checkpoints and G Protein-Coupled Receptor signaling. Immune profiling revealed cytotoxic lymphocyte depletion (CD8+ T cells: Spearman's \u03c1 = -0.247, <i>p</i> < 0.001; NK CD56bright cells: Spearman's \u03c1 = -0.276, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and Th2 polarization (Spearman's \u03c1 = 0.117, <i>p</i> = 0.006). <b>Conclusions</b>: This comprehensive EC study establishes KLRG2 as a dual diagnostic/prognostic biomarker and immunomodulatory target. These findings provide a rationale for developing KLRG2-directed therapies to counteract tumor-intrinsic proliferation and microenvironmental immune suppression. Future single-cell analyses are warranted to dissect KLRG2-mediated tumor-immune crosstalk.",

          "abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is characterized by substantial genetic heterogeneity, making it challenging to identify reliable biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is widely recognized as a predictive biomarker due to its association with immune response and treatment efficacy. In this study, we take a different approach by treating TMB as a response variable to uncover its genetic drivers using multiomics data. We conducted a thorough evaluation of recent feature selection methods through extensive simulations and identified three top-performing approaches: projection correlation screening (PC-Screen), distance correlation sure independence screening (DC-SIS), and Wasserstein distance-based screening (WD-Screen). Unlike traditional approaches that rely on simple statistical tests or dataset splitting for validation, we adopt a method-based validation strategy, selecting top-ranked features from each method and identifying consistently selected genes across all three. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, we integrated copy number alteration (CNA), mRNA expression, and DNA methylation data as predictors and applied our selected methods. In the two-platform analysis (mRNA + CNA), we identified 13 key genes, including both previously reported LUAD-associated genes (<i>CCNG1, CKAP2L, HSD17B4, SHROOM1, TIGD6</i>, and <i>TMEM173</i>) and novel candidates (<i>DTWD2, FLJ33630, NME5, NUDT12, PCBD2, REEP5</i>, and <i>SLC22A5</i>). Expanding to a three-platform analysis (mRNA + CNA + methylation) further refined our findings, with <i>PCBD2</i> and <i>TMEM173</i> emerging as the robust candidates. These results highlight the complexity of multiomics integration and the need for advanced feature selection techniques to uncover biologically meaningful patterns. Our multiomics strategy and robust selection approach provide insights into the genetic determinants of TMB, offering potential biomarkers for targeted LUAD therapies and demonstrating the power of Wasserstein distance-based feature selection in complex genomic analysis.",

Therefore, identifying novel therapeutic targets for breast cancer is urgently needed. The peroxiredoxin (PRDX) family is regarded as a good diagnostic marker for various tumors. However, the expression and prognostic significance of PRDX family members in breast cancer remain unclear and require systematic investigation. By using bioinformatic tools such as UALCAN, TIMER2.0, Human Protein Atlas Project (HPA), Gene Set Cancer Analysis (GSCA), and the cBioportal database, we systematically analyzed the expression pattern, prognostic value, methylation status and immune infiltrating association of PRDX gene family members in breast cancer. Through comprehensive analysis, we found that PRDX4 has good prognostic value and is closely related to immune infiltration, and further exploration of its oncogenic function in breast cancer is warranted. Subsequently, we performed a series of cellular assays to explore the potential role of PRDX4 in the progression of breast cancer. We demonstrated that PRDX4 promoted the proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and inhibited the apoptosis of breast cancer cells. In addition, PRDX4 expression was associated with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of neratinib which primarily targets human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and showed good binding in molecular docking. Our subsequent experiments showed that the PRDX4-HER2 axis may serve as a potential combined target for neratinib therapy. Our findings suggest that PRDX4 may be a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for breast cancer, and targeting PRDX4 could represent a novel strategy to improve the efficacy of targeted therapy for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.",

While multi-omics technologies are generating ever more detailed maps of the histone landscape, translating these insights into clinical practice remains challenging. The ongoing convergence of high-throughput omics technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing drug repositioning strategies, offering new precision tools to identify histone-targeted therapies for solid tumors. In this review, we explore how AI-driven multi-omics integration is currently reshaping therapeutic opportunities by uncovering novel drug-target-patient associations with unprecedented accuracy. Special focus is given to gynecologic and breast cancers, where chromatin remodeling dysregulation is particularly widespread, conventional therapeutic approaches have demonstrated substantial limitations and drug resistance represents a major clinical obstacle. These aggressive and lethal cancers exemplify areas where AI-powered repurposing of epi-drugs is making tangible clinical advances, enhancing tumor sensitivity to treatments like immunotherapy, but also offering new avenues to overcome challenging phenomena such as drug resistance and cancer relapse. We critically discuss these challenges and the effectiveness of a combination strategy approaches based on AI-driven patient stratification and biomarker-guided therapy optimization to maximize clinical benefits. In an era where precision oncology demands both specific drugs and the application of smarter strategies, the integration of AI, multi-omics, and targeting of chromatin remodelers may herald a transformative shift in the management of solid tumors, bridging the gap between biological insights and therapeutic innovation.",

          "abstract": "Kirsten Rat Sarcoma (KRAS) copy number amplification has emerged as an oncogenic driver in colorectal cancer (CRC), in addition to KRAS mutation. However, its clinical significance remains poorly understood. Notably, CRC patients with wild-type KRAS but harboring KRAS amplification have shown resistance to anti-EGFR therapy, representing an unmet clinical need. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the impact of KRAS amplification-alone and in conjunction with mutation-on clinicopathological characteristics, immune infiltration, and therapeutic response. KRAS copy number variation (CNV) was classified into amplification and non-amplification groups. KRAS mutational status was determined as wild-type (WT) or mutant (MUT) using qPCR and Sanger sequencing. CD8\u207a T lymphocyte infiltration was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in resected CRC specimens. Clinical, immune, and survival data were analyzed in association with KRAS status. RNA-seq was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched pathways. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were used to assess responses to targeted therapies. We found that KRAS amplification was more frequent in WT KRAS CRC (21.4%) than in MUT KRAS CRC (6.5%). In the WT subgroup, KRAS amplification was associated with poor prognosis and increased KRAS protein expression and downstream pathway activation. In contrast, amplification had little effect in mutant KRAS tumors. KRAS copy number was inversely correlated with CD8\u207a T cell infiltration, suggesting a role in immune evasion. Importantly, low CD8\u207a T cell density combined with KRAS amplification predicted adverse outcomes. Therapeutically, KRAS-amplified PDX models were resistant to anti-EGFR treatment. However, combined MEK and CDK4/6 inhibition overcame this resistance. KRAS amplification constitutes a distinct oncogenic driver in CRC and a potential biomarker for therapeutic stratification. Our findings support the clinical rationale for dual MEK and CDK4/6 inhibition in KRAS-amplified CRC and highlight the need for biomarker-guided clinical trials to optimize treatment strategies in this subset of patients.",

Targeted, next-generation sequencing of cancer-specific genes is clinically feasible and enables comprehensive somatic reporting; without a matched germline specimen, germline alterations can confound analyses of the somatic profile and generate uncertainty in interpretation. This work reports the validation and implementation of optional matched tumor/germline sequencing in a precision cancer medicine program. DNA from 63 patient samples was analyzed using OncoPanel, a hybrid capture-based sequencing assay of 461 genes. Three analytical pipelines were implemented: tumor only, matched tumor/germline, and germline only. For matched tumor/germline, germline alterations in 19 genes with actionable/therapeutic implications were rescued. Retrospective analysis of the first 1600 matched cases was done to determine the potential clinical utility of this approach. Limit of detection for point mutations/insertions and deletions was 3% allele fraction; reproducibility was >98%. Matched tumor/germline concordance across 938 somatic calls was 100%. The average tumor mutational burden (TMB) was approximately 4 mutations/Mb lower than tumor-only sequencing. TMB-high patients were accurately reclassified as TMB-low in 14% of cases. Twenty-five percent of validation cases (14% after launch) had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variant conferring cancer susceptibility; 14% of validation cases (7% after launch) harbored a germline variant of therapeutic significance. Matched tumor/germline sequencing is more accurate than tumor-only sequencing, while still encompassing all genomic findings that inform targeted therapy selection.",

However, its roles in prognostication and tumor immune microenvironment modulation in endometrial cancer (EC) remain incompletely defined. We systematically analyzed HMGA2 expression patterns and clinical prognostic value in EC using bioinformatics strategies, including TCGA and GTEX data mining, as well as single gene expression analysis. Functional enrichment analysis (GSEA and KEGG) identified HMGA2-associated pathways. The correlation between HMGA2 and immune infiltration was assessed via TIMER and TISIDB. Subsequent <i>in vitro</i> (proliferation, migration, colony formation) and <i>in vivo</i> (xenograft models) experimental were used to validate HMGA2's role in promoting EC progression. The correlation between HMGA2 and macrophage markers (CD86 and CD206) was validated through clinical tissue samples by IHC. Finally, a recurrence-predictive nomogram incorporating HMGA2 with clinicopathological parameters was established. HMGA2 exhibited significant upregulation in endometrial cancer (EC) tissues and correlated with poor patient prognosis. Immunoassay showed that high expression of HMGA2 was negatively correlated with infiltration of various immune cells, especially M1 macrophages. Cytological experiments showed that knocking down HMGA2 significantly inhibited EC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and drug resistance, while overexpression of HMGA2 promoted the above phenotype; Animal experiments showed that knocking down HMGA2 significantly inhibited the growth of EC tumors and the expression of M1 macrophage marker CD86. The combination of HMGA2 inhibitors and targeted macrophage immunotherapy (CD47 monoclonal antibody) had the better tumor suppression effect. Clinical sample analysis found that high expression of HMGA2 was significantly negatively correlated with CD86 and positively correlated with CD206 expression. Patients with low HMGA2 expression showed enhanced immune therapy responsiveness. The nomogram model based on HMGA2 and clinical pathological parameters showed better predictive performance (AUC=0.855, sensitivity=79.0%, specificity=76.8%). HMGA2 is a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for the EC. HMGA2 may drive the occurrence and development of EC by inhibiting the infiltration of immune cells, especially M1 macrophages. Therapeutic targeting of HMGA2 is a novel strategy for EC intervention.",

Knowledge of which cells express FAS-L in patients with cancer and whether these sources compromise CAR persistence remains incomplete. Here, we constructed a single-cell atlas of diverse cancers to identify cellular subsets expressing FASLG, the gene encoding FAS-L. We discovered that FASLG expression is limited primarily to endogenous T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and CAR-T cells, while tumor and stromal cell expression is minimal. To establish whether CAR-T and CAR-NK cell survival is FAS-L regulated, we performed competitive fitness assays using FAS-dominant negative receptor (\u0394FAS)-modified lymphocytes. Following transfer, \u0394FAS-expressing CAR-T/CAR-NK cells became enriched, a phenomenon that mechanistically was reverted through FASLG knockout. By contrast, FASLG was dispensable for CAR-mediated tumor killing. In multiple models in female mice, \u0394FAS coexpression enhanced antitumor efficacy. Together, these findings reveal that CAR-engineered lymphocyte persistence is governed by a FAS-L/FAS autoregulatory circuit.",

However, which genes drive their selective advantage is not well established, and therefore they are hardly utilized in clinical practice. Our analysis of copy number patterns in pan-cancer datasets suggests that the selective advantage of copy number gains is largely driven by known oncogenes. Analysis of CRISPR screening data identifies a list of 101 genes that are likely to mediate the effect of these gains, which is highly enriched in annotated oncogenes but also contains genes that have not been implicated in cancer so far. Moreover, we show that specific gains are associated with drug sensitivity or resistance, with a strong enrichment of gains of oncogenes with increased sensitivity to inhibitors targeting these specific genes. Finally, we provide examples where gains can function as relevant clinical biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment. Thus, large copy number gains exert their selective advantage through known and novel oncogenes, and their systematic analysis could advance precision oncology.",

          "abstract": "Cancer subtypes play a critical role in disease progression, prognosis, and treatment, making their detection essential for tailoring precision medicine. Studies have shown that multi-omics integration outperforms single-omics approaches in cancer subtyping tasks. However, due to the high-dimensionality of multi-omics data, many existing studies either fail to capture the correlation between true labels and learned features, or lack sufficient capacity to model complex biological representations. These limitations hinder the full potential of leveraging the rich and complementary information embedded in multi-omics datasets. We propose a framework that leverages supervised feature learning and classification based on a graph-based learning approach with attention mechanism for cancer subtyping. More specifically, we train graph convolutional network models on each omics dataset to extract latent representations, which are then concatenated to form a comprehensive multi-omics feature embedding. We further develop sample fusion network based on the omics-specific graphs, incorporating the derived features and feeding them into a graph attention model for subtype classification. This two-stage multi-omics framework is applied to eight cancer types, with performance evaluated in terms of test accuracy, training time, macro-averaged precision, recall, and F-score. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various cancer types. Additionally, we provide empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis that retaining a limited number of high-confidence edges and utilizing enriched embeddings from intermediate graph neural network layers can improve predictive performance.

Therapeutically actionable MET alterations include MET exon 14\u00a0skipping (METex14) mutations, MET amplification and/or MET overexpression and MET fusions, which vary in incidence by tumour type. In contrast to rare de novo MET alterations, acquired MET amplification and/or MET overexpression is a relatively common phenomenon that is associated with distinct clinical implications and responses to treatment. METex14 is a distinct oncogenic driver mutation in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To date, the MET tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) capmatinib, tepotinib and savolitinib have been approved for the treatment of advanced-stage METex14-mutant NSCLC. However, the treatment paradigms for MET-altered solid tumours are rapidly evolving to include diverse MET-targeted agents. Emerging data support the role of MET TKIs, anti-MET antibodies and MET-directed antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as monotherapy or in\u00a0combination with other therapies for NSCLC or other tumour types with MET amplification and/or overexpression. Indeed, in May 2025, the MET-directed ADC telisotuzumab vedotin was approved by the FDA for patients with previously treated advanced-stage nonsquamous NSCLC overexpressing MET (\u226550% of tumour cells with 3+ staining on immunohistochemistry). Understanding the unique MET-related adverse events will be crucial when incorporating these agents into daily clinical practice. In this Review, we highlight the rationale for targeting MET alterations across various solid tumour types and provide a summary of the clinical efficacy and toxicity profiles of the approved and emerging MET-targeted TKIs, monoclonal or bispecific antibodies and ADCs.",

          "abstract": "Medulloblastoma is an aggressive central nervous system tumor affecting children more commonly between the ages of 5-9. It is usually localized in the cerebellum, leading to diffusion of tumor cells through the cerebrospinal fluid and metastases to other portions of the brain and spinal cord. Conventional treatment consists of surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation and/or chemotherapy. The side effects of these therapies are critical to consider, especially given that patients are in a distinct stage of their lives. In addition, the overall survival is not satisfactory ranging from 50-90% depending on the type of medulloblastoma. The molecular characterization has broadly subdivided medulloblastoma into four subgroups, and more recently, the single-cell transcriptomics studies have further identified several other subgroups. Important advances have been reported on the cell origin, their plasticity, heterogeneity of genetic and epigenetic alteration, and interaction with the immune and stromal components of the tumor microenvironment. Research studies on these key points are essential to make advances in planning the application of conventional therapies together with immunotherapies. Herein, we discuss the main advances recently obtained on medulloblastoma biology and immunotherapies. Overall, the biological and molecular features of medulloblastoma are briefly summarized to understand the reason for the application of the old and new immunotherapies. Immunotherapies considered include the identification of potential medulloblastoma neoantigens and tumor-associated antigens to generate antigen-specific T lymphocytes. The main antigens expressed by medulloblastoma cells and/or by components of the tumor microenvironment will be considered as the molecular targets of antibodies, antibody derivatives, and chimeric antigen receptor effector cells to improve the conventional therapies. In the last portion of this review, the brief analysis of the activating and inhibiting receptors expressed by antitumor T, natural killer, and unconventional T cells can give new insights into the potential treatment of medulloblastoma.",

          "abstract": "Cancer remains one of the leading health threats globally, with therapeutic resistance being a long-standing challenge across chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. In recent years, the association between epigenetic modification abnormalities and therapeutic resistance in tumors has garnered widespread attention, spurring interest in the development of approaches to target epigenetic factors. In this review, we explore the widespread dysregulation and crosstalk of various types of epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA changes, which interact through complex regulatory networks in tumors. Clinically, single-targeted therapy based on epigenetic modification usually has its limited effect against cancer. However, the combination of epigenetic drugs with other treatment modalities, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy, shows potential for synergistically enhancing efficacy and reducing drug resistance. Therefore, we evaluate the possibility and potential mechanisms of targeting epigenetic modifications to overcome resistance in cancer therapy, and discuss the challenges and opportunities in moving epigenetic therapy into clinical practice. Moreover, the application of multi-omics technologies will aid in identifying core epigenetic factors from complex epigenetic networks, enabling precision treatment and overcoming therapeutic resistance in tumors. Furthermore, the development of spatial multi-omics technologies, by providing spatial coordinates of cellular and molecular heterogeneity, revolutionizes our understanding of the tumor microenvironment, offering new perspectives for precision therapy. In summary, the combined application of epigenetic therapies and the integration of multi-omics technologies herald a new direction for cancer treatment, holding the potential to achieve more effective personalized treatment strategies.",

          "abstract": "Evasion of programmed cell death (PCD) is a hallmark of cancer, yet the mechanisms underlying resistance to ferroptosis - an iron-dependent form of PCD triggered by excessive lipid peroxidation - remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized nucleolar-mitochondrial signaling axis that promotes ferroptosis resistance in pleural mesothelioma (PM) and potentially other cancers. This pathway involves RNA polymerase I (PolI) catalytic subunit A (POLR1A) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), which together regulate mitophagy and intracellular iron metabolism to suppress ferroptosis. Mechanistically, POLR1A controls TFAM expression via the transcription factor ATF4, and this POLR1A-ATF4-TFAM axis inhibits mitophagy and limit mitophagy-dependent labile Fe<sup>2+</sup> release, thereby preventing Fe<sup>2+</sup>-driven lipid peroxidation. Disruption of this pathway through POLR1A or TFAM inhibition leads to Fe<sup>2+</sup> accumulation and increased sensitivity to ferroptosis inducers (FINs). Notably, CX-5461, a first-in-class RNA PolI inhibitor currently in clinical trials, synergizes with GPX4 blockade to induce ferroptotic cell death both in vitro and in vivo. This therapeutic synergy extends beyond PM, suggesting broader relevance in ferroptosis-resistant cancers. Together, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of ferroptosis evasion and establish a promising combinatorial strategy to overcome therapy resistance in cancer.",

We aimed to define the landscape of DLL3 expression and feasibility of DLL3-targeted imaging in this population.

Incorporating prior biological knowledge directly can enhance understanding and address small sample sizes. Nevertheless, current models do not jointly consider prior knowledge of molecular interactions and sample labels. We present GRACKLE, a novel nonnegative matrix factorization approach that applies Graph Regularization Across Contextual KnowLedgE.

Simulation studies show GRACKLE outperformed other NMF algorithms, especially with increased background noise. GRACKLE effectively stratified breast tumor samples and identified condition-enriched subgroups in individuals with Down syndrome. The model's latent representations aligned with known biological patterns, such as autoimmune conditions and sleep apnea in Down syndrome.

Comprehensive multi-omics integration revealed transcriptional target genes of FRA1, with AXL, CDK6, and FSCN1 exhibiting increased expression in melanoma metastasis and a significant correlation with poor patient outcomes. Silencing AXL, CDK6, or FSCN1 abrogated FRA1-mediated invasion in vitro and reduced metastatic colonization.

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing or lacking full-length RHAMM (RHAMM<sup>FL</sup>, amino acids 1-794) and the shorter isoform RHAMM<sup>\u0394163</sup> (amino acids 164-794), were explored to examine the effect of RHAMM isoforms on mRNA expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and selective shelterin proteins regulating telomere maintenance.

In contrast, RHAMM<sup>FL</sup> did not have significant effect on TERT expression and telomerase activity.

PCNA aberrations manifest in different disease phenotypes, including neoplastic proliferation, chromatin disassembly, genomic instability, and impaired DNA repair. Although the role of PCNA in control of DNA homeostasis has been extensively studied in some cancers, its pan-cancer relevance in tumorigenesis, immune interactions, and therapeutic resistance remains underexplored. Here, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of publicly available databases to assess the relationship between PCNA expression and the immunological, survival, genetic, functional, and drug sensitivity profiles across multiple cancer types. PCNA mRNA levels were altered in across cancers and associated with altered cancer signaling networks constituting Wnt, Hippo, and mTOR pathways. Increased transcript levels were associated with poor overall survival in some cancers, including ACC, CESC, LGG, and THYM. Amplification was the predominant genetic alteration of PCNA in multiple tumors. In several tumors, upregulation of PCNA was linked with differences in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and specific immune-inhibitors, and chemokines. Moreover, elevated PCNA expression was linked with increased sensitivity to several drugs, particularly to Navitoclax, NPK76-II-72-1, and Ciclopirox across cancers. Our study orients the first comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of PCNA, uncovering its prognostic significance and altered expression across various cancers through multiomics data. Unlike previous studies, tumor-specific genetic alterations, such as amplification and hypomethylation, and the paradoxical immune microenvironment linked to PCNA were explored, suggesting potential immune evasion mechanisms. Additionally, new therapeutic avenues reveal PCNA's relationship with drug sensitivity to agents like Navitoclax and Ciclopirox, providing invaluable insights for pharmacological interventions.",

          "abstract": "Aging is a critical yet understudied determinant in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Despite a strong epidemiological association with age, conventional PDAC preclinical models fail to capture the histopathological and stromal complexities that emerge in older organisms. Using an age-relevant syngeneic orthotopic model, we demonstrate that organismal aging accelerates PDAC progression and metastasis. Through transcriptomic profiling, we identify a conserved extracellular matrix gene signature enriched in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from aged tumors, consistent with an augmented fibrotic landscape that supports immunosuppression, metastatic tropism, and poor prognosis. To directly test the functional impact of stromal aging, we employed heterochronic co-implantation models, revealing that revitalizing the aged tumor stroma with young CAFs restores immune infiltration and attenuates metastasis in older hosts. Conversely, aged CAFs, while immunosuppressive, fail to enhance metastasis in young hosts, suggesting that a youthful microenvironment exerts dominant regulatory control over disease progression. These findings demonstrate that stromal age is a critical modulator of both immune exclusion and metastatic behavior in PDAC. Importantly, our work establishes a new conceptual framework for understanding how aging shapes the tumor microenvironment in PDAC and opens a fertile avenue of investigation into age-specific stromal regulation. Moreover, this work raises compelling questions about the underlying molecular mechanisms-questions now accessible through our models-and lays the foundation for future efforts to therapeutically target stromal aging in PDAC.",

          "abstract": "Gastric cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. The genetic factors contributing to gastric cancer progression and resistance to therapies, particularly radiotherapy, are not fully understood. TP53, ATM, RAD51, and BAX are genes involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, and response to stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression patterns of these genes in gastric cancer, their potential role in radiotherapy resistance, and their diagnostic value. Gene expression levels of TP53, ATM, RAD51, and BAX were assessed using RT-qPCR across 9 gastric cancer cell lines and 6 normal control cell lines. Additionally, protein expression was confirmed via IHC and TCGA dataset analysis. Methylation levels of these genes were evaluated in gastric cancer tissues using the GSCA database. Mutational analysis was conducted using cBioPortal, and survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier and meta-analysis. The radiotherapy resistance study was carried out by knocking down TP53, RAD51, and BAX in AGS and MKN-45 gastric cancer cell lines, followed by expression analysis, colony formation, and wound healing assays. The expression of TP53, RAD51, and BAX was significantly upregulated, while ATM was downregulated in gastric cancer cell lines compared to normal controls. All four genes demonstrated good discriminatory power (AUC\u2009=\u20091) in distinguishing gastric cancer from normal samples. Methylation analysis revealed significant hypomethylation of TP53, RAD51, and BAX, and hypermethylation of ATM in gastric cancer tissues. Mutational analysis showed that TP53 was altered in 88% of gastric cancer samples, while ATM, RAD51, and BAX exhibited lower mutation rates. Survival analysis suggested that elevated expression of TP53, RAD51, and BAX may be linked to poorer survival outcomes, while reduced ATM expression appeared to associate with decreased overall survival. However, these associations require further validation through additional studies. Knockdown of TP53, RAD51, and BAX in AGS and MKN-45 cells resulted in significantly reduced cell proliferation and slower wound healing, highlighting their role in radiotherapy resistance. The TP53, RAD51, and BAX genes are significantly involved in gastric cancer progression and resistance to radiotherapy. Their expression and mutation status provide valuable diagnostic and prognostic information.",

The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (<i>PI3K</i>) pathway plays a key role in tumor progression, survival, and therapeutic resistance in colorectal cancer (CRC), yet its impact in EOCRC remains insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we developed AI-HOPE-PI3K, a conversational artificial intelligence platform that integrates harmonized clinical and genomic data for real-time, natural language-based analysis of <i>PI3K</i> pathway alterations. Built on a fine-tuned biomedical LLaMA 3 model, the system automates cohort generation, survival modeling, and mutation frequency comparisons using multi-institutional cBioPortal datasets annotated with clinical variables. AI-HOPE-PI3K replicated known associations and revealed new findings, including worse survival in colon versus rectal tumors harboring <i>PI3K</i> alterations, enrichment of <i>INPP4B</i> mutations in Hispanic/Latino EOCRC patients, and favorable survival outcomes associated with high tumor mutational burden in FOLFIRI-treated patients. The platform also enabled context-specific survival analyses stratified by age, tumor stage, and molecular alterations. These findings support the utility of AI-HOPE-PI3K as a scalable and accessible tool for integrative, pathway-specific analysis, demonstrating its potential to advance precision oncology and reduce disparities in EOCRC through data-driven discovery.",

This study explores ABCE1 (ATP-binding cassette subfamily E member 1) as a potential biomarker for CRC and delves into its intricate molecular mechanisms. Through integrated bioinformatic analyses, this study underscores the significant oncogenic role of ABCE1 in CRC, opening new avenues for promising therapeutic interventions. Deletion of ABCE1 reduced cell growth, abrogated aerobic glycolysis, and promoted apoptosis in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells. Further validation through experimentation with irinotecan revealed compelling outcomes, including diminished cell growth, induces G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and promotes apoptosis in HCT-116 and HT-29 colorectal cancer cells. ABCE1 KO with irinotecan combined treatment significantly increased the inhibition of cell proliferation and aerobic glycolysis in CRC cells, accentuating the multifaceted role of ABCE1 in CRC progression. Moreover, this work also demonstrated the complex relationship between ABCE1 and the p53 signalling pathway, which was confirmed in experimental assays. These assays also revealed that deletion of ABCE1 with irinotecan might regulate G1 phase cell cycle arrest, inhibit metabolic regulation, and activate the p53 pathway to induce apoptosis in HCT-116 cells. Molecular docking analyses further supported these findings, revealing the strong binding affinity of irinotecan for targets of the p53 signalling cascade. Collectively, these comprehensive insights support the potential therapeutic efficacy of targeting ABCE1 in CRC treatment strategies. Overall, the findings from this study underscore the importance of ABCE1 as a potential biomarker in CRC and illuminate its complex molecular mechanisms. The demonstrated effectiveness of ABCE1 inhibition, particularly through irinotecan, coupled with its interplay with crucial signalling pathways such as p53, highlights its potential as a promising therapeutic option for colorectal cancer treatment.",

          "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most malignant subtype of breast cancer that lacks reliable targets for diagnosis and therapy. Non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-encoded products hold promise for addressing this unmet need. By analyzing the reported ribosomal RNA sequencing data, combined with the TCGA, ORFfinder, SmProt databases, we identified CDKN2B-AS1, a TNBC-upregulated lncRNA encoding a 66-amino-acid peptide via CUG-initiated translation. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and mass spectrometry confirmed endogenous expression of this peptide, designated 66CTG, in TNBC cells. Functionally independently of its host RNA, 66CTG promoted the proliferation of TNBC cells and the tumor growth of TNBC xenograft by stabilizing c-Myc protein and enhancing Cyclin D1 transcription. Immunohistochemistry of 89 clinical TNBC paraffin samples revealed positive correlations among 66CTG, c-Myc, and Cyclin D1 expression levels. Mechanistically, co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays revealed that 66CTG stabilized c-Myc by competitively interacting with FBW7\u03b1, an E3 ligase responsible for recognizing 66CTG CPD<sup>S56/S60</sup> motif which phosphorylated by GSK-3\u03b2 during the late G1 phase. In conclusion, our findings suggest 66CTG has potential to be developed as a target for TNBC diagnosis and therapy. Furthermore, it unveils a regulatory axis wherein 66CTG stabilizes c-Myc by interacting with FBW7\u03b1, offering a new mechanistic explanation for c-Myc overexpression in TNBC. Patients co-overexpressing 66CTG, c-Myc, and Cyclin D1 may benefit from therapies targeting this axis.",

A subset of these tumors, including epithelioid GBM, can harbor the BRAF V600E mutation, which drives tumor growth via persistent activation of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. Recently, the combination of dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor) and trametinib (MEK inhibitor) has been approved for treating inoperable solid tumors with this mutation. The authors present the case of a 51-year-old man with epithelioid GBM harboring the BRAF V600E mutation who developed early leptomeningeal metastasis (LMM) following standard therapy with surgery, temozolomide, and radiotherapy. Owing to disease progression, he was treated with dabrafenib and trametinib. Remarkably, the patient showed rapid clinical and radiographic improvement within 2 weeks of treatment initiation. MR images demonstrated significant reduction in tumor-associated edema and contrast enhancement. At the 28-week follow-up, the patient achieved near-complete radiographic remission without notable adverse effects. This case highlights the potential of BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy to significantly improve outcomes in patients with aggressive gliomas and LMM, conditions typically associated with extremely poor prognosis.

XGBoost classification achieved an overall accuracy of 88% (IBD: 71%, controls: 93%), with SHAP analysis pinpointing nine key genes, including AQP9, CXCL8, IFITM1, and ITGA5. Validation with blood RNA-seq data (GSE169568, n\u2009=\u2009205) showed ITGA5 (AUC: 0.856) and CXCL8 (AUC: 0.786) had the highest diagnostic performance.

Clinical data analysis demonstrates that STXBP1 expression levels significantly correlate with HNSC patient prognosis, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic marker and prognostic indicator. Mechanistic studies show that targeted inhibition of STXBP1 effectively downregulates CD47 expression and restores the anti-tumor function of macrophages. Based on bioinformatics screening and experimental validation, we discovered that the natural compound Catechin can specifically inhibit STXBP1 expression and significantly suppress tumor growth.

          "abstract": "In the past decade, studies have reclassified infiltrating glioblastomas (GBM) IDH-wildtype utilizing molecular and phenotypic features. Cystic GBMs are one such phenotypic subtype whose genetic and clinical characteristics remain incompletely understood. The goal of this study was to genetically characterize cystic GBMs and examine patient outcomes as compared to non-cystic GBMs. Retrospective analysis of GBM IDH-wildtype with pre-operative and post-operative MRI and comprehensive next-generation sequencing were performed with evaluation of 205 genes. Tumors were evaluated by their cystic characteristics. Benjamini-Hochberg's false discovery rate (BH-FDR) was performed for multiple comparison adjustments. Univariable and multivariable analysis for survival was performed. 176 GBM IDH-WT patients met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 17 patients were identified as having a cystic component. Compared to non-cystic GBMs, cystic GBMs had a higher incidence of mutation in PDGFRA (41.2% vs. 16.4%, p\u2009=\u20090.021), RB1 (35.3% vs 11.9%, p\u2009=\u20090.019), and KIT (35.3% vs 10.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.012), and a lower incidence of mutation in CDKN2A/B (41.2% vs 69.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.029). No difference in progression-free survival (6.87 vs 7.83\u00a0months. p\u2009=\u20090.541) or overall survival (19.5 vs 18.2\u00a0months, p\u2009=\u20090.243) was identified between patients with cystic versus non-cystic GBM. Cystic GBMs were found to have lower frequencies of CDKN2A/B alterations and higher frequencies of PDGFRA, KIT, and RB1 alterations as compared to non-cystic GBMs. No statistically significant differences in PFS or OS were identified.",

          "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly prevalent and lethal malignancy worldwide, with its progression and metastasis significantly impacting patient prognosis. JPT1 (Jupiter microtubule-associated homolog 1), a novel microtubule-associated protein, has been implicated in regulating cytoskeletal stability, microtubule dynamics, and the immune microenvironment, thereby potentially driving HCC development and progression. However, the precise role and underlying mechanisms of JPT1 in HCC remain poorly understood. This study integrated data from TCGA-LIHC and GEO (GSE14520) databases to systematically investigate the expression profile of JPT1 and its association with clinicopathological features and prognosis in HCC patients. A pan-cancer analysis was performed to evaluate JPT1 expression patterns and prognostic value across multiple cancer types. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis, functional enrichment analysis (GSEA and KEGG), and spatial transcriptomics were utilized to explore the biological functions and mechanisms of JPT1 in tumor biology. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard models were employed to assess the prognostic potential of JPT1, while a nomogram was constructed to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates in HCC patients. JPT1 was significantly overexpressed in HCC tissues, and high JPT1 expression was strongly associated with poor prognosis. The ROC analysis demonstrated that JPT1 expression had high diagnostic accuracy for HCC, with AUC values of 0.931 and 0.948 in the TCGA and GEO cohorts, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that JPT1-associated genes were enriched in pathways related to cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and organic acid metabolism. GSVA further indicated that the high JPT1 expression group was significantly enriched in hallmark pathways such as hypoxia response, hormone response, and KRAS signaling. Spatial transcriptomics analysis showed that JPT1 was predominantly localized in low malignancy tumor regions and positively correlated with immune cells, including CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells, CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells, and macrophages. Additionally, high JPT1 expression was associated with an increased mutation frequency of TP53 and CTNNB1. JPT1 plays a pivotal role in HCC progression, with its overexpression strongly linked to tumor advancement and poor prognosis. JPT1 likely contributes to the malignant evolution of HCC by modulating tumor metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and the immune microenvironment. This study provides a comprehensive insight into the role of JPT1 in HCC and establishes a theoretical foundation for its potential as a molecular biomarker and therapeutic target.",

The heterogeneity of BC subtypes poses challenges in understanding molecular mechanisms, early diagnosis, and disease management. Recent studies suggest that integrating multi-omics layers can significantly enhance BC subtype identification. However, evaluating different multi-omics integration methods for BC subtyping remains ambiguous. In this study, we conducted a multi-omics integration analysis on 960 BC patient samples, incorporating three omics layers: Host transcriptomics, epigenomics, and shotgun microbiome. We compared two integration approaches the statistical-based approach (MOFA+) and a deep learning-based approach (MOGCN) for this integration. We evaluated both methods using complementary evaluation criteria. First, we assessed the ability of selected features to discriminate between BC subtypes using both linear and nonlinear classification models. Second, we analyzed the biological relevance of the selected features to key BC pathways, focusing on transcriptomics-driven insights. Our results showed that MOFA+ outperformed MOGCN in feature selection, achieving the highest F1 score (0.75) in the nonlinear classification model, with MOFA+ also identifying 121 relevant pathways compared to 100 from MOGCN. Notably, one of the key pathways Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis and the SNARE pathway was implicated, offering insights into immune responses and tumor progression. These findings suggest that MOFA+ is a more effective unsupervised tool for feature selection in BC subtyping. Our study underscores the potential of multi-omics integration to improve BC subtype prediction and provides critical insights for advancing personalized medicine in BC.",

          "abstract": "EGFLAM is a versatile protein widely expressed in multiple human tissues, yet its function in pan-cancer is not fully understood. To investigate the molecular function of EGFLAM, a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis was carried out using several public databases and bioinformatics tools. Ultimately, confirmatory experiments were conducted in vitro with gastric cancer cell lines. The results showed that EGFLAM expression was elevated in multiple cancer types, especially gastric cancer. It also demonstrated prognostic predictive value in several cancer types, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker. The dysregulation of EGFLAM expression observed in certain cancers might be attributed to factors such as promoter methylation changes, mRNA methylation modifications, and genetic alterations of the EGFLAM locus. EGFLAM expression was associated with Immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoints, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI). Single-cell analysis of gastric cancer showed that EGFLAM was predominantly expressed in fibroblast populations. Functional enrichment analyses (GO/KEGG) demonstrated EGFLAM involvement in extracellular matrix receptor interactions and PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. RT\u2012qPCR confirmed EGFLAM upregulation in gastric cancer specimens compared to normal controls. In vitro functional assays revealed that EGFLAM knockdown significantly suppressed gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while inducing apoptosis. Collectively, our multi-omics analyses delineated EGFLAM's oncogenic functions across cancer types, positioning it as both a promising prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer.",

To uncover regulators of macrophage cytotoxicity towards cancer cells, we perform two co-culture CRISPR screens using CAR-macrophages targeting different tumor associated antigens. Both identify ATG9A as an important regulator of this cytotoxic activity. In vitro and in vivo, ATG9A depletion in cancer cells sensitizes them to macrophage-mediated killing. Proteomic and lipidomic analyses reveal that ATG9A deficiency impairs the cancer cell response to macrophage-induced plasma membrane damage through defective lysosomal exocytosis, reduced ceramide production, and disrupted caveolar endocytosis. Depleting non-cytotoxic macrophages using CSF1R inhibition while preventing ATG9A-mediated tumor membrane repair enhances the anti-tumor activity of therapeutic antibodies in mice. Thus, macrophage cytotoxicity plays an important role in tumor elimination during antibody or CAR-macrophage treatment, and inhibiting tumor membrane repair via ATG9A, particularly in combination with cytotoxic macrophage enrichment through CSF1R inhibition, improves tumor-targeting macrophage efficacy.",

Targeted therapy and immunotherapy have become pivotal treatment strategies for EC patients. However, the current methods and biomarkers for predicting immunotherapy responses and prognosis are remain limited. Programmed cell death (PCD) pathways play a crucial role in cancer development and progression and may serve as prognostic markers and indicators of drug sensitivity in EC. In our study, we integrated multiple PCD pathways and comprehensive multi-omics datasets from TCGA-EC and GEO databases. By analyzing distinct PCD signatures, we discovered two major EC subgroups with distinctive prognoses, tumor microenvironment (TME) profiles, and responses to immunotherapy. To further investigate the cellular basis of these PCD patterns, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis was conducted to explore tumor heterogeneity in PCD characteristics across EC subpopulations. Further investigation revealed seven key PCD-associated genes (HIF3A, ACTL8, SIRPG, FBN3, ARHGAP30, CD6, and P2RY13) that formed the basis for a novel prognostic scoring system-risk score (RS). Our findings showed that patients with lower risk scores had better survival rates and improved immunotherapy outcomes. Conversely, patients with higher risk scores experienced poor clinical outcomes and reduced immunotherapy efficacy, although alternative therapies such as docetaxel and olaparib demonstrated potential therapeutic benefits. Overall, the RS provides a valuable tool for early prognosis prediction and for identifying patients who may benefit from immunotherapy.",

The associations among G protein subunit gamma transducin 1(GNGT1) expression, clinicopathological features, and prognosis were assessed via the UALCAN and Kaplan-Meier databases. The CIBERSORT algorithm in R software and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis(ssGSEA) were used to analyse the proportions of infiltrating immune cells in the high-expression group and the low-expression group.GNGT1 expression was substantially greater in GC tissues than in normal tissues, and patients with GC who had high GNGT1 expression had worse clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes. Immunohistochemistry(IHC) experiments on stomach adenocarcinoma(STAD) samples confirmed the aberrant expression of GNGT1 and its association with a poor prognosis. Subsequent investigations revealed substantial negative correlations between GNGT1 and tumour mutational burden(TMB), microsatellite instability(MSI), immune cell infiltration, immune cell gene marker expression and immunological checkpoint expression in patients with STAD.GNGT1 is a reliable biomarker in patients with GC that also has an immunomodulatory function in this disease and may accelerate GC development by suppressing the infiltration of T cells, dendritic cells, M1 macrophages and B cells.",

The FAM3 gene family, comprising FAM3A, FAM3B, FAM3C, and FAM3D, has been implicated in various cancers, but their roles in KIRC are not well understood. This study investigated the expression, diagnostic potential, and functional significance of FAM3 family genes in KIRC. This study explores the expression and functional roles of FAM3 family genes in KIRC using in silico and in vitro experiments. We performed RT-qPCR analysis to assess the expression of FAM3A, FAM3B, FAM3C, and FAM3D in KIRC and normal cell lines, revealing significant upregulation of FAM3A and FAM3D and downregulation of FAM3B and FAM3C in cancerous cells. ROC analysis demonstrated that FAM3 genes possess high diagnostic potential. Further validation using TCGA, OncoDB, and Human Protein Atlas (HPA) databases confirmed these expression patterns and their association with cancer progression. Methylation analysis indicated hypomethylation of FAM3A and FAM3D and hypermethylation of FAM3B and FAM3C, correlating with differential gene expression. Survival analysis revealed that high FAM3A expression was linked to poor prognosis, while low FAM3C expression correlated with reduced survival. Functional assays demonstrated that knockdown of FAM3A in 786-O cells reduced proliferation, clonogenicity, and migration, underscoring its potential role in KIRC pathogenesis. Additionally, FAM3 genes exhibited significant correlations with immune cell infiltration, immune inhibitor genes, and drug resistance, suggesting their involvement in modulating the tumor microenvironment. The miRNA-mRNA network analysis identified hsa-mir-19b-3p as a key regulator of FAM3 genes, further implicating these genes in KIRC progression.

AC-selective drugs have an advantage in side effect control, and the specific AC may finally be considered as a therapeutic target. We show that adenylyl cyclase 4 (ADCY4), which is silenced by DNA methylation and is critical for breast cancer (BC) patient survival, plays essential roles in anti-tumor effects in BC cells. DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and histone deacetylase inhibitor can restore ADCY4 mRNA expression in ADCY4-silenced BC cells. ADCY4 directly affects BC cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis. Mechanistically, ADCY4 converts ATP to cAMP and activates cAMP/PKA signaling, leading to a decrease in the phosphorylation level of downstream FAK/AKT and ERK signaling and creating a suppression environment for cell survival. Ectopic ADCY4 inhibits BC growth, which is blocked by cAMP inhibition, activating AKT and ERK. The present study provides evidence that human BC relies upon this epigenetic silenced ADCY4-associated ATP-cAMP loop for phosphorylation and activation of FAK/AKT and ERK signaling. Also, ADCY4 increases BC cell chemosensitivity to paclitaxel. The observations demonstrates that ADCY4 is a significant tumor suppressor and that loss of ADCY4 functions by DNA methylation hampers cAMP signaling and triggers FAK/AKT and ERK signaling during breast tumorigenesis.",

CIP2A is a key regulator for cellular processes (e.g. proliferation, DNA damage) and is involved in the progression of many malignancies. In this study we provide a comprehensive overview of its role in OvCa making use of in silico tools, clinical samples and in vitro models. CIP2A is overexpressed in OvCa patients, with metastatic patients having significantly higher expression when compared to patients with malignant and benign ovarian tumours. High CIP2A expression reduces both overall-and progression-free survival, whereas an R530T mutation is predicted to cause structural destabilisation of the CIP2A dimer. We also provide evidence for microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA target interactions with CIP2A. Finally, we have studied the effects of CIP2A inhibition in an in vitro BRCA2 model compared to BRCA2 wild-type OvCa cells, using RNA-sequencing.

Netrin-1 protein controls the biological processes of cancer cells, guiding axon pathfinding and transmitting signals that are essential for migration, differentiation and cell survival via UNC5 and DCC-family receptors. To elaborate further, Netrin1 controls YAP signalling through its neogenin receptor, which affects the EMT process in gastric cancer. Researchers have also utilized the Netrin-1 protein with different nanoparticles to explore its way to prevent cancer progression. Moreover, Researchers evaluated the use of nanoparticles as an immunosensor, therapeutic and imaging tools targetting the Netrin-1 protein, which open several ways to combat cancer. This review explores how Netrin-1 influences the AKT signaling cascade impacting hippo signaling, YAP pathways and EMT process with DCC receptor. It also discusses the involvement of UNC5B and Netrin-1 in regulating ERK/MAPK signaling pathways and induction of apoptosis when Netrin-1 is absent. Moreover, it underscores the therapeutic potential of UNC5B-induced cell cycle arrest in specific cancer. Also, it delves into the diverse forms of netrin and its potential role in cancer and the glims of nanoparticles use with it. Underlining the necessity for more research to comprehend their functions in signaling cascades using the nanomaterials.",

          "abstract": "Urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) is the ninth most common cancer worldwide. It is essential to investigate factors that may affect susceptibility and determine the prognosis of UBC. IRF5 is an interferon regulatory factor that modulates cellular differentiation during immune responses and oncogenesis. The frequency of the rs3757385 (T\u2009>\u2009G) variant in IRF5 was evaluated in 295 patients with UBC and 295 individuals without neoplasia in a Brazilian population. Nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) systemic levels and IRF5 expression in normal and tumoral bladder tissues were also evaluated, as was the interaction between these parameters and prognostic indicators. Bioinformatics analyses compared gene expression patterns with TCGA data. The polymorphism was not associated with susceptibility to UBC. The mutated allele (G) was associated with a decrease in the relapses in the genotypic (OR\u2009=\u20090.205) and dominant (OR\u2009=\u20090.380) models. Hypertensive individuals with TG (genotypic, OR\u2009=\u20090.079) or TG\u2009+\u2009GG (dominant model, OR\u2009=\u20090.184) had fewer muscle-invasive tumors. Polymorphism did not alter the plasmatic NOx levels. Higher IRF5 expression was observed in patients with at least one G allele, males, smokers, and alcoholics. Directly, NOx was not associated with the prognostic parameters; however, individuals with the G allele and high NOx levels showed protection against relapses. Our study highlights the association between rs3757385 (G allele) and high plasmatic NOx levels as good prognostic factors in UBC.",

We present the Artificial Intelligence Agent for High-Optimization and Precision Medicine (AI-HOPE), an AI-driven system that enables domain experts to conduct integrative data analyses through natural language interactions. Powered by Large Language Models, AI-HOPE interprets user instructions, converts them into executable code, and autonomously analyzes locally stored data. It supports flexible association studies, subset comparisons, clinical prevalence assessments and survival analyses. In addition, AI-HOPE enables global variable scans to identify features significantly associated with a user-defined outcome, making a powerful and intuitive tool for advancing precision medicine research. Importantly, its closed-system design prevents clinical data leakage. To demonstrate its utility, AI-HOPE was applied to The Cancer Genome Atlas data to address two clinical questions. First, it identified significant enrichment of TP53 mutations in late-stage colorectal cancer compared to early-stage cases. Second, it uncovered a strong association between KRAS mutations and poorer progression-free survival in FOLFOX-treated patients. These findings align with established literature and demonstrate AI-HOPE's ability to generate meaningful insights independently, without prior assumptions. By removing programming barriers and simplifying complex analyses, AI-HOPE bridges the gap between data complexity and research needs. With its scalable and adaptable framework, AI-HOPE has the potential to support diverse biomedical research fields, driving innovation and efficiency in translational studies. The AI-HOPE software and demonstration data is available at https://github.com/Velazquez-Villarreal-Lab/AI-HOPE.",

          "abstract": "PP2A holoenzymes account nearly 50% of Ser/Thr phosphatase activities in human cells, yet their roles in oncogenesis remain largely unexplored. A PP2A holoenzyme consists of a catalytic subunit, a scaffold subunit, and a regulatory subunit. We previously reported that PR55\u03b1, a PP2A regulatory subunit, supports the tumorigenic and metastatic potential of pancreatic cancer cells, and this is associated with its role in promoting YAP activation, which is essential for tumorigenesis and progression in most solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer. However, the direct role of PR55\u03b1 in tumorigenesis has not yet been assessed. Using telomerase-immortalized human pancreatic ductal cells (HPNE), this research reveals a mechanism in which PR55\u03b1/PP2A cooperates with oncogenic KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> to drive cellular transformation and tumorigenesis in vivo. HPNE-transduced with PR55\u03b1 and KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> exhibited accelerated proliferation and migration, and anchorage-independent growth, hallmark features of malignant transformation. Biochemical studies demonstrated that PR55\u03b1-induced YAP activation was further enhanced by KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>, primarily through the inhibition of the MST/LATS cascade. The essential role of YAP activation in HPNE transformation by PR55\u03b1 and KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> was confirmed by YAP inhibition. Finally, in vivo studies revealed that HPNE cells transformed by PR55\u03b1 and KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> were tumorigenic in mice. Collectively, these findings highlight the critical role of PR55\u03b1/PP2A in supporting KRAS-driven tumorigenesis, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying pancreatic cancer progression.",

          "abstract": "Lyn is a multifunctional Src-family kinase (SFK) that regulates immune signaling and has been implicated in diverse types of cancer. Unlike other SFKs, its full-length structure and regulatory dynamics remain poorly characterized. In this study, we present the first long-timescale molecular dynamics analysis of full-length Lyn, including the SH3, SH2, and SH1 domains, across wildtype, ligand-bound, and cancer-associated mutant states. Using principal component analysis, dynamic cross-correlation matrices, and network-based methods, we show that ATP binding stabilizes the kinase core and promotes interdomain coordination, while the ATP-competitive inhibitor dasatinib and specific mutations (e.g., E290K, I364N) induce conformational decoupling and weaken long-range communication. We identify integration modules and develop an interface-weighted scoring scheme to rank dynamically central residues. This analysis reveals 44 allosteric hubs spanning SH3, SH2, SH1, and interdomain regions. Finally, a random forest classifier trained on 16 MD-derived features highlights key interdomain descriptors, distinguishing functional states with an AUC of 0.98. Our results offer a dynamic and network-level framework for understanding Lyn regulation and identify potential regulatory hotspots for structure-based drug design. More broadly, our approach demonstrates the value of integrating full-length MD simulations with network and machine learning techniques to probe allosteric control in multidomain kinases.",

          "abstract": "This study analyzes publicly available RNA-seq data to comprehensively include the complex heterogeneity of prostate cancer (PCa) etiology. It combines prostate and prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines, representing primary PCa cells, Gleason scores, ages, and PCa of different racial origins. Additionally, some cell lines were exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The research aims to identify hub genes and transcription factors (TFs) of the prostate carcinogenesis pathway as molecular targets for clinical investigations to elucidate EDC-induced aggressiveness and to develop potential biomarkers for their exposure risk assessments. PCa cells rely on androgen receptor (AR)-mediated signaling to survive, develop, and function. Fifteen various RNA-seq datasets were normalized for distribution, and the significance (<i>p</i>-value < 0.05) threshold of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was set based on |log2FC| \u2265 2 change. Through integrated bioinformatics, we applied cBioPortal, UCSC-Xena, TIMER2.0, and TRRUST platforms, among others, to associate hub genes and their TFs based on their biologically meaningful roles in aggressive prostate carcinogenesis. Among all RNA-Seq datasets, we found 75 overlapping DEGs, with BUB1B (32%) and CCNB1 (29%) genes exhibiting the highest degree of mutation, amplification, and deletion. EDC-associated CCNB1, BUB1B, and CCNA2 in PCa cells exposed to EDCs were consistently shown to be associated with high Gleason scores (\u22654 + 3) and in the >60 age group of patients. Selected TFs (E2F4, MYC, and YBX1) were also significantly associated with DEGs (NCAPG, MKI67, CCNA2, CCNB1, CDK1, CCNB2, AURKA, UBE2C, BUB1B) and influenced the overall survival (<i>p</i>-value < 0.05) of PCa cases. This is one of the first comprehensive studies combining 15 publicly available RNA-seq datasets to demonstrate the association of EDC-associated hub genes and their TFs aligning with the aggressive carcinogenic pathways in the higher age group (>60 years) of patients. The findings highlight the potential of these hub genes as candidates for further studies to develop molecular biomarkers for assessing the EDC-related PCa risk, diagnosing PCa aggressiveness, and identifying therapeutic targets.",

We combine it with single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing analyses, human organotypic GBM cultures, in vivo cell-specific CRISPR-Cas9-driven genetic perturbations as well as human and mouse experimental systems to identify an annexin A1-formyl peptide receptor 1 (ANXA1-FPR1) bidirectional astrocyte-GBM communication pathway that limits tumour-specific immunity. FPR1 inhibits immunogenic necroptosis in tumour cells, and ANXA1 suppresses NF-\u03baB and inflammasome activation in astrocytes. ANXA1 expression in astrocytes and FPR1 expression in cancer cells are associated with poor outcomes in\u00a0individuals with GBM. The inactivation of astrocyte-glioma ANXA1-FPR1 signalling enhanced dendritic cell, T cell and macrophage responses, increasing infiltration by tumour-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and limiting T cell exhaustion.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled the identification of diverse KRASm subtypes with distinct prognoses, co-mutation patterns and clinical characteristics. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and pathological characteristics of KRASm patients across all stages of NSCLC. We analysed NSCLC patients from 2019 to 2021 using the Illumina Focus 52-gene targeted NGS panel, which detects DNA and RNA alterations. PD-L1 expression was assessed using the SP263 antibody. We examined the clinical and pathological characteristics of KRASm patients, including KRASm subtypes and co-mutations. Of the 123 patients, 62 (50.4%) had KRASm, with a median age of 67 years (range 49-92). Of these, 79% were male, 87.1% had adenocarcinomas and only 8.1% were non-smokers. NGS alone was sufficient for molecular characterisation in 19.4% of cases; in 75.8%, an additional single molecular test was required. KRASm subtypes were distributed as follows: G12C (33.8%), G12V (25.8%), G12D (21%) and Q61H (6.5%). G12V was more prevalent in non-smokers (60%). Co-mutations were detected in 24.2% of patients, with PIK3CA being the most frequent. PD-L1 expression >50% was observed in 19.4% of patients. No significant associations were identified between KRAS subtypes and PD-L1 expression levels or co-mutations.Significant differences in the clinical stage were noted across KRASm subtypes. Early-stage disease accounted for 24.19% of KRASm cases, with G12D observed in 40% of these patients. However, G12C and G12V subtypes were more frequently associated with metastatic disease (<i>p</i> = 0.004). While differences in median overall survival were observed across KRASm subtypes, they were not statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.5). The presence of co-mutations and high PD-L1 expression was suggested to be associated with a worse prognosis, without reaching statistical significance (<i>p</i> = 0.4 and <i>p</i> = 0.06, respectively). This study underscores the importance of assessing KRAS status and subtypes in NSCLC, particularly in early-stage disease, due to their association with metastatic risk. This could have relevance in treatment strategies and subsequent monitoring, which could necessarily be closer in higher risk patients. Moreover, while PD-L1 status shows potential as a prognostic factor in KRASm patients, further research is needed to confirm this relationship.",

Here, we demonstrate that the leukemia-suppressive functions of TET2 are preserved in the absence of PROSER1. Nonetheless, we find that loss of PROSER1 partially recapitulates the aberrant enhancer DNA methylation phenotype observed upon TET2 knockout, suggesting that PROSER1 and TET2 play both cooperative and distinct roles in the regulation of DNA methylation in hematopoiesis. Importantly, using serial hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation assays, we find progressive exhaustion of HSC activity and reduction in hematopoietic lineage output upon loss of PROSER1. Our findings imply that, beyond the established role of TET2 loss-of-function mutations in promoting HSC expansion and leukemic transformation, accurate TET activity, regulated by PROSER1, is equally important to prevent HSC exhaustion and sustain normal hematopoiesis.",

          "abstract": "Vasorin (VASN) is linked to tumor progression in various cancers, its role and regulatory mechanisms in gastric cancer (GC) are still unknown. Human gastric mucosal samples, VASN heterozygous-deficient (VASN<sup>+/-</sup>) C57BL/6 mice, and gastric cell lines with VASN knockdown and overexpression were used to study VASN's role in GC. A combination of in vitro and in vivo models, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), proteomics, bioinformatics, and various assays revealed VASN's critical involvement in GC. Elevated VASN expression was significantly associated with poor clinical outcomes in GC patients. We identified a strong correlation between increased VASN expression, driven by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, and the progression of gastric carcinogenesis. Functional studies demonstrated that VASN overexpression enhanced the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric epithelial cells, whereas VASN knockdown suppressed these malignant phenotypes. Mechanistically, the collagen type IV alpha 1 chain (COL4A1) was identified as a critical downstream effector of VASN in GC. VASN exerted its oncogenic effects by regulating COL4A1 to activate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, H. pylori infection was demonstrated to induce hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) expression, which subsequently upregulated VASN. The HIF-1\u03b1-VASN-COL4A1-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is crucial for gastric tumor development and may represent a therapeutic target for GC.",

The human Ribonuclease K (RNASEK)\u00a0gene is involved in various cellular processes, such as viral infection, immune response, and maintaining cellular homeostasis. RNASEK, found in metazoans, contributes to tumor development, but the lack of systemic pan-cancer investigation into the diagnostic and prognostic function of RNASEK,\u00a0epigenetic regulation, and interaction with the immune cell infiltration remains unclear. This study investigated RNASEK as a potential pan-cancer biomarker. Public databases such as Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), and University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Data Analysis Portal (UALCAN) assessed RNASEK expression patterns. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets validated these expressions. UALCAN examined RNASEK's expression differences, DNA methylation, and clinical features. TIMER analyzed SNHG8 expression about immune cell infiltration, while prognosis was evaluated through GEPIA, UALCAN, and Kaplan-Meier (KM) Plotter. cBioPortal reviewed the genetic alterations of RNASEK. Our study revealed a significant upregulation of RNASEK (<i>P\u00a0</i>< 0.05) in six cancers: bladder (BLCA), cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), esophageal (ESCA), head/neck squamous cell (HNSC), liver (LIHC), and thyroid (THCA). This was accompanied by notable hypomethylation in BLCA, HNSC, LIHC, and Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC), associated with increased RNASEK expression. Significant differences (<i>P\u00a0</i>< 0.05) were noted between stage 1 and stage 3 in ESCA, HNSC, and THCAas well as significant differences (<i>P\u00a0</i>< 0.05) in HNSC between African-American and Asian populations. Additionally, age-related expression differences were significant (<i>P\u00a0</i>< 0.05) in HNSC across young (21-40 years), middle-aged (41-60 years), and older (61-80 years) groups. A weak positive correlation (<i>P\u00a0</i>< 0.05) existed between RNASEK expression and various immune cell infiltrations such as B cells, CD8+ T-cells, CD4+ T-cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells in patients with BLCA, ESCA, HNSC, and LIHC, while THCA presented moderate negative correlations with CD4+ T-cells and neutrophils. Moreover, High RNASEK expression indicated a good prognosis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.49, <i>P</i> = 0.0007). RNASEK was altered in less than 1% (95 samples out of 10,967 samples) across various tumor types. The highest alteration\u00a0rates\u00a0were identified as significant deletions in miscellaneous neuroepithelial tumors,\u00a0one case out of 31 cases (3.23%), amplifications in sarcoma, four cases out of 255 cases (1.96%), and mutations in endometrial cancer, which is two cases out of 586 (0.34%). \u00a0In conclusion,\u00a0this study's pan-cancer analysis revealed that RNASEK could be a potential diagnostic biomarker in six cancer types, including BLCA, CHOL, ESCA, HNSC, LIHC, and THCA, and as a prognostic biomarker in PAAD.",

Despite extensive research on apoptosis and autophagy, necrotic cell death mechanisms like pyroptosis, which have the potential to stimulate anti-tumor immune responses, remain largely underexplored in GB. Here, we investigated whether Gasdermin E (GSDME)-mediated pyroptosis can be induced in GB by employing the drug raptinal, an inducer of cytochrome c release. Using human patient-derived and mouse GB cell lines, we showed that raptinal promotes GSMDE cleavage. However, although a strong pyroptotic response was observed in mouse cell lines, it was weak in human cell lines. This resistance was partially reversed by the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM, indicating that membrane repair mechanisms may counteract the pyroptotic response. Gsdme knockout (KO) in mouse GB cells unexpectedly prolonged the survival of immunocompetent mice, demonstrating a tumor-promoting role of GSDME independent of its pyroptotic function. Analysis of the immune microenvironment revealed that Gsdme KO promoted infiltration of T cells, which was confirmed by spatial transcriptomic analysis of GB patient samples. In addition, Gsdme/GSMDE KO reduced the invasive capacity of mouse/human GB cells. In conclusion, active membrane repair mechanisms may impair the pyroptotic efficacy in GB. GSDME has a tumor-promoting role in GB by suppressing T cell infiltration and increasing tumor cell invasion.",

          "abstract": "Virotherapy eradicates tumors by directly killing cancer cells and causing adjuvant effects. However, the mechanism by which non-replicating virotherapy exerts anti-tumor effects is unclear. In this study, we investigated the genes that mediate the anti-tumor effects of ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated Hemagglutinating Virus of Japan envelope (HVJ-E) using RNA sequencing, gene knockout, and a drug-inducible gene expression system. We examined the antitumor effects of Apolipoprotein d (Apod) using genome-wide CRISPR library screening, in situ biotinylation combined with mass spectrometry, flow cytometry, biochemistry, and tumor-bearing mouse models. Here, we show that HVJ-E represses tumor growth via Irf7-induced Apod expression in tumor cells <i>in vivo</i>. Irf7 in B16F10 cells is a pivotal transcription factor for HVJ-E-induced anti-tumor effects. Apod substantially suppresses tumor growth even in HVJ-E-insensitive tumors. Apod is required to increase NKG2D-ligand genes in HVJ-E-treated tumors. Genome-wide CRISPR library screening and <i>in situ</i> biotinylation of Apod reveal an association of Apod with ERK2. Mechanistically, Apod prevents the nuclear translocation of ERK2 and Importin7, increasing NKG2D-ligands expression in B16F10 cells and attenuating tumor growth. Treating a local tumor with a combination therapy of Apod with the anti-OX40, T cell costimulatory molecule, antibody substantially repressed tumor growth in target and non-target lesions alongside T cell activation. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of how HVJ-E induces anti-tumor effects and can aid the development of therapeutic strategies for eliciting anti-tumor immunity.",

Prognostic associations were assessed through survival analysis, and gene mutation frequencies were compared between high and low DSN1 expression groups. Gene set enrichment analysis was conducted to identify relevant biological pathways. We also examined the correlation of DSN1 with DNA methylation, tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), immune infiltration, and immune-regulatory genes. <b>Results:</b> Our analysis revealed that DSN1 is consistently overexpressed in tumor cells and actively dividing cells compared to normal tissues. The overexpression of DSN1 showed a significant correlation with either poor or favorable prognosis, depending on the cancer type. Notably, cancers such as COAD, LUAD, and UCEC exhibited high mutation and amplification frequencies in the DSN1-high group. Gene set enrichment analysis identified cell cycle-related pathways as the most significantly associated with DSN1 expression.

          "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks among the most aggressive malignancies worldwide, with poor outcomes attributed to delayed diagnosis and therapeutic limitations. Emerging evidence suggests that de novo lipogenesis (DNL) plays a crucial role in HCC progression and its interaction with the immune microenvironment. We systematically analyzed DNL-related gene expression profiles from TCGA, GEO, ICGC-LIRI datasets, and our Xiangya HCC cohort (n\u2009=\u2009106) to construct a prognostic risk model. Through LASSO-Cox regression analysis, we identified six signature genes (G6PD, LCAT, SERPINE1, SOAT2, CYP2C9, and UGT1A10) that effectively stratified patients into distinct risk groups. We evaluated clinical characteristics, immune cell infiltration patterns, and differential therapeutic responses between high-risk and low-risk groups. Comprehensive validation included immunohistochemical analysis and Western blotting to assess expression levels of key model genes, along with multiplex immunofluorescence staining and single-cell RNA sequencing(scRNA-seq) to characterize immune microenvironmental differences between risk groups. We successfully established a robust six-gene prognostic signature (G6PD, LCAT, SERPINE1, SOAT2, CYP2C9, and UGT1A10) based on de novo lipogenesis pathways, which demonstrated excellent predictive performance (AUC: 0.78-0.82). The model revealed significant differences in immune infiltration patterns between risk groups, with the high-risk group exhibiting immunosuppressive characteristics characterized by increased Treg cell infiltration, while the low-risk group showed greater NK cell retention. Integrated scRNA-seq and our cohort validation further demonstrated that high-risk scores were associated with poorer response to immunotherapy but greater sensitivity to targeted therapies. These findings suggest that de novo lipogenesis-mediated immune evasion contributes to therapy resistance and worse prognosis in high-risk HCC patients, whereas low-risk HCC patients maintain an immunologically active microenvironment more amenable to immunotherapy. This study provided a novel prognostic model for HCC, incorporating 6 representative DNLs. The model demonstrated the potential for predicting HCC prognosis and highlighted the involvement of immune cell infiltration and the association between risk scores and clinical therapy. Validation of model genes further supported the association between de novo lipogenesis and HCC development.",

We analyzed the clinicogenomic features of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC receiving first-line osimertinib with extracranial next generation sequencing (NGS) (n = 262) and individuals with intracranial NGS (n = 81). Paired extra- and intracranial NGS was available for 14 patients. Time-to-event analyses were conducted from time of metastatic diagnosis, except for time-to-treatment discontinuation (TTD), which began at treatment initiation. Among 262 patients receiving first-line osimertinib, 53% developed CNS metastases (36% de novo, 16% acquired on treatment). The cumulative incidence of brain (BrM) and leptomeningeal metastases (LM) was 39% and 2% at 1 year, 49% and 6% at 3 years, and 54% and 12% at 5 years, respectively. CNS metastases correlated with a higher frequency of CARD11 amplifications (14% versus 3%, P = 0.031) and a lower frequency of MDM2 amplifications (1% versus 13%, P = 0.008) in extracranial NGS specimens, with otherwise similar genomic profiles. Patients who developed CNS metastases on treatment had worse overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.41 to 5.59], followed by those with de novo (HR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.26), compared with those who never developed CNS metastases (P < 0.001). In multivariable Cox regression, atypical EGFR mutations were associated with shorter OS. Cell cycle pathway alterations were more frequent in BrM than LM samples (93% versus 47%, P = 0.003, q = 0.03). No other significant genomic differences were found between BrM and LM, or between paired CNS and systemic samples. Patients with atypical EGFR mutations or acquired CNS metastases on osimertinib have worse outcomes. Comparative NGS profiling of intra- and extracranial tumors suggest that CNS dissemination is driven by mechanisms beyond single-gene alterations.",

          "abstract": "Adrenomedullin (ADM), a multifunctional peptide, has been implicated in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. However, its role in cancer, particularly in NSCLC, remained under-explored. This called for a pan-cancer analysis of ADM, investigating its expression, genomic alterations, prognostic value, immune associations, and relations with drug sensitivity to provide insights into its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker. ADM expression data from normal and tumor tissues was retrieved and analyzed through HPA and Timer 2.0 online platforms. Genetic alterations, copy number variations (CNVs), and methylation patterns were analyzed using cBioPortal and GSCA platforms. The data for survival analysis was extracted from TCGA and GEO database and analyzed through GEPIA and PrognoScan online platforms. ADM's correlations with immune checkpoint genes, immune cell infiltration, MSI, and TMB were evaluated using data from Timer and TCGA via R. Drug sensitivity analysis was performed with GDSC and CTRP databases, supported by network visualizations. IHC staining was conducted on LUAD patients' samples to assess ADM's relationship with EGFR-TKI resistance and immune microenvironment. ADM was widely expressed across normal tissues, with high levels in adipose tissue, endocrine organs, digestive and reproductive systems. Pan-cancer analysis revealed that ADM expression was upregulated in multiple cancer types, including CESC, ESCA, GBM, HNSC, KICH, KIRC, LUSC, PCPG, THCA, and UCEC, and correlated with advanced pathological stages in THCA, KIRP, and HNSC. Furthermore, high ADM expression was significantly linked to poor prognosis in patients with LGG, LUAD, MESO, THYM, LIHC, HNSC, GBM, KICH, KIRP, CESC, PAAD, and STAD, while its negative influence on OS and RFS was validated in LUAD. In addition, ADM exhibited genetic alterations, including amplification and deep deletion across multiple cancer types. Strong and consistent positive correlations were witnessed between ADM and several immune checkpoint genes, including CD274 (PD-L1), CD276, TNFRSF18, TNFSF9, and PVR in pan-cancer analysis, indicating its role in the development of suppressive immune microenvironment and T cell exhaustion. Besides, ADM showed significant correlations with immune cell infiltration, and TMB/MSI, highlighting its role in immune regulation and its potential as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy. Significantly, ADM expression was correlated with multiple drug sensitivity, particularly chemotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) therapy. Moreover, positive correlations between its expression and EGFR-TKI resistance, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration and tumor proportion score (TPS) in LUAD were validated in patients' samples, emphasizing its potential in guiding personalized therapy. This pan-cancer analysis revealed ADM's pivotal role in progression, immune modulation, and therapeutic response, especially in LUAD. ADM held promise as a prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in immune modulation and resistance management. Future research should focus on experimental validation and elucidation of ADM-mediated pathways, which might provide novel insights into cancer biology and improve clinical outcomes.",

          "abstract": "The kidney's tubular system relies on cell polarity and tight junctions to maintain structure and function and disruptions contribute to diseases like cancer. Loss of tight junction proteins such as Claudins can actively contribute to tumorigenesis. We aimed to identify biomarkers for renal carcinoma, after kidney transplantation and conventional kidney tumors. We identified the epigenetic silencing of the Claudin 10 gene isoform B (CLDN10B) through DNA hypermethylation in renal cancers, including clear cell (ccRCC), papillary (pRCC) and post-transplantation renal carcinoma (PT-ccRCC). In contrast, CLDN10A was hypomethylated in ccRCC and pRCC. Differential methylation of the isoforms discriminates RCC from other malignancies. The epigenetic alteration of CLDN10B significantly correlated with reduced patient survival and advanced tumor staging. CLDN10B overexpression or induction significantly inhibited migration, cell cycle progression, and cellular growth. Using a CRISPR-based epigenetic editing tool\u00a0reactivated CLDN10B to its endogenous level using VP160 and TET1 by promoter demethylation and significantly demonstrated its tumor-suppressive effects in 2D and 3D cell models. Our findings suggest that CLDN10B acts as a tumor suppressor, and its epigenetic regulation may represent a therapeutic target for RCC. Ultimately, understanding CLDN10B's regulation and function could provide new insights into renal cancer treatment.",

They can arise from disease-associated fibroblasts (DAFs) to support or restrain tumor growth. How many CAF subtypes exist and what signals drive their development is unclear. Currently, there are three commonly accepted subtypes, namely myofibroblast-like (myCAF), immunomodulatory (iCAF), and antigen-presenting (apCAF). Here, we analyzed the correlation between clinical risk factors with the proportion of each CAF subtype. In our patient cohort (n\u2009=\u200921), we investigated DAFs from patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) and CAFs from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients after surgical resection via flow cytometry and RNA expression analysis. The expression of iCAF marker Interleukin-6 displayed significant differences depending on lifestyle factors, such as smoking status, age, and Body Mass Index (BMI). The apCAF marker HLA-DQA1 correlated with age. The largest difference showed the quantitative difference of apCAF markers in ~40% of PDAC- and ~20% of CP patients. In conclusion, clinical risk factors may influence the prevelance of specific CAF subsets. Unraveling the complex interplay between CAFs and tumor cells is crucial for novel therapies to improve long-term survival for pancreatic cancer patients.",

This study integrates network toxicology, multi-omics analyses, and molecular docking to systematically delineate phthalate-driven oncogenic pathways, thereby bridging mechanistic gaps and informing targeted interventions. We identified 234 potential targets related to phthalate exposure and ovarian cancer. Enrichment analysis revealed that these genes are associated with HIF-1 signaling, and metabolic pathways that promote cancer progression. Seven core genes were identified, with six (GAPDH, CASP3, PPARG, ESR1, CYCS, SIRT1, and CCND1) exhibiting differential expression in the TCGA ovarian cancer cohort. Single-cell analysis confirmed their widespread expression across various cell types, underscoring their roles in tumor biology. Molecular docking revealed specific binding interactions between phthalates and six core proteins. Integrated computational analyses indicate that phthalates (DEP, DMP, DOP) may drive ovarian carcinogenesis through metabolic reprogramming (HIF-1\u03b1/glycolysis), strong binding to SIRT1/PPAR\u03b1 regulators, and tumor microenvironment remodeling. These findings establish a framework for prioritizing environmental carcinogens and identifying exposure biomarkers, with implications for reevaluating phthalate safety and elucidating the SIRT1-HIF1-PPAR\u03b1 axis in cancer pathogenesis.",

Among them, lncRNA SRRM2-AS1 has emerged as a significant factor, yet its functions in ovarian cancer remain insufficiently understood. We analyzed SRRM2-AS1 expression and genetic alterations using data from TCGA, GEO, and cBioPortal. Enrichment analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with SRRM2-AS1 were conducted via Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Immune cell infiltrations were assessed with the single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm, while subcellular localization was predicted using the lncATLAS database. We conducted qRT-PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to examine the expression and localization of SRRM2-AS1. Cellular assays were performed to assess the impact of SRRM2-AS1 inhibition in ovarian cancer. SRRM2-AS1 expression was significantly elevated in ovarian cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, as evidenced by data from TCGA, GTEx, and supported by the GSE18520 and GSE40595 datasets, along with our own samples (14 ovarian cancer tissues and 9 normal tissues). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated its potential as a diagnostic biomarker with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.758. We identified 957 DEGs associated with SRRM2-AS1, with GO and KEGG enrichment analyses highlighting their involvement in microtubule-based movement, cilium movement and immune cell interactions. Immune infiltration analyses indicated significant correlations between SRRM2-AS1 expression and various immune cell types, suggesting its role in modulating the tumor microenvironment. Subcellular localization studies using the lncATLAS database, qRT-PCR, and FISH confirmed the nuclear predominance of SRRM2-AS1 in ovarian cancer cells. Functionally, SRRM2-AS1 knockdown inhibited ovarian cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. These findings underscore the potential of SRRM2-AS1 as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target in ovarian cancer, highlighting the need for further investigation into its mechanistic roles and clinical applications.",

This malignancy usually develops resistance to conventional chemotherapy, underscoring the need for robust preclinical models to guide the development of novel therapies. Here, we introduce an HGSC mouse model generated via <i>Ovgp1</i>-driven Cre recombinase effecting CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of <i>Trp53, Rb1</i>, and <i>Nf1</i> tumor suppressors in mouse oviductal epithelium (<i>m-sgPRN</i> model). Cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) inactivation-frequently observed in human HGSC-is associated with poorer outcomes, DNA damage accumulation (including tandem duplications), and increased tumor immunogenicity. In our system, coablation of <i>Cdk12</i> (<i>m-sgPRN;Cdk12KO</i>) recapitulated hallmark features of HGSC, while accelerating tumor progression and reducing survival. In a conventional (Cre-lox-mediated) <i>Trp53/Nf1/Rb1</i> triple knockout model with concurrent <i>Cdk12</i> ablation (<i>PRN</i>;<i>Cdk12KO</i> mice), we observed T cell-rich immune infiltrates mirroring those seen clinically. We established both models as subcutaneous or intraperitoneal syngeneic allografts of <i>CDK12</i>-inactivated HGSC that exhibited sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. Furthermore, a CRISPR/Cas9 synthetic lethality screen in <i>PRN;Cdk12KO</i>-derived cell lines identified CDK13-an essential paralog of CDK12-as the most depleted candidate, confirming a previously reported synthetic lethal interaction. Pharmacologic CDK13/12 degradation (employing YJ1206) demonstrated enhanced efficacy in cell lines derived from both <i>m-sgPRN;Cdk12KO</i> and <i>PRN</i>;<i>Cdk12KO</i> models. Our results define <i>CDK12</i> as a key tumor suppressor in tubo-ovarian HGSC and highlight CDK13 targeting as a promising therapeutic approach in <i>CDK12</i>-inactive disease.

However, patients whose melanomas harbor driver mutations in the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene often lack effective targeted treatment options when their tumors do not respond to immunotherapy. In this study, we utilized patient-derived short-term cultures and multiomics approaches to identify molecular features that could inform the development of therapies for patients with NF1-mutant (NF1Mut) melanoma. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that EGFR is highly expressed and active in NF1Mut melanoma cells, in which it hyperactivates ERK and AKT, leading to increased tumor cell proliferation, survival, and growth. In contrast, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR hindered cell proliferation and survival and suppressed tumor growth in patient-derived NF1Mut melanoma models but not in NF1 wild-type models. These results reveal a connection between NF1 loss and increased EGFR expression that is critical for the survival and growth of NF1Mut melanoma cells in patient-derived culture and xenograft models, irrespective of their BRAF and NRAS mutation status. NF1 mutant melanomas rely on EGFR activation and can be effectively treated with the EGFR inhibitors cetuximab or afatinib, supporting further testing in clinical trials.",

However, its biological function in pan-cancer remains largely unexplored. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data and corresponding clinical variables were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Immunotherapy cohorts were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Tumor Immune Estimation Resource was used to evaluate tumor-infiltrating immune cell levels. The Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub (TISCH) 2 database was used to examine TNFSF4 expression across various tumor cell subsets. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to investigate TNFSF4-associated signaling pathways. Bioinformatic analyses of TNFSF4 across TCGA cancers revealed that TNFSF4 expression was highly increased in cancers compared to normal tissues. Further immunohistochemistry staining of multiple tumor samples validated this finding. Univariate Cox regression and survival analyses identified TNFSF4 as a risk factor in most cancers. Furthermore, TNFSF4 expression increased with tumor stage progression in several cancers. In the two immunotherapy cohorts from the GEO database, the proportion of partial response/complete response patients was higher in the TNFSF4 low-expression group. Single-cell RNA-seq data from the TISCH database indicated that TNFSF4 expression was predominantly observed in proliferative and exhausted T cells. Correlation analysis demonstrated a positive association between TNFSF4 and immunomodulatory genes. Ultimately, GSEA revealed that TNFSF4 was related to immune response and epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathways. This multi-omics analysis highlights the role of TNFSF4 in tumor progression and immune modulation. High TNFSF4 expression correlates with poor survival and may affect immunotherapy efficacy, suggesting its potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.",

Identifying common biomarkers may improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and provide novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets. The study primarily employed bioinformatics tools to analyze publicly available datasets to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and hub genes in KIRC and MN. Functional interactions of the common DEGs were explored using protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and hub genes were further investigated through gene expression databases such as GSCA and UALCAN. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to assess functional enrichment and tumor-driving potential. These bioinformatic results were then experimentally validated by knocking down FYN and LGALS8 in 786-O cells using siRNA, followed by RT-qPCR, protein analysis, and functional assays. The study identified four hub genes (FYN, LGALS8, MAGI2, and WT1) in KIRC and MN, with FYN and LGALS8 upregulated and MAGI2 and WT1 downregulated. Bioinformatics validation showed excellent diagnostic performance and confirmed methylation and mutation patterns. Higher FYN and LGALS8 expression were linked to poorer survival. miRNA downregulation was validated in KIRC cell lines. Functional analysis revealed that FYN and LGALS8 promote KIRC progression through the ErbB signaling pathway, and knockdown experiments reduced cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation. Our findings identify FYN, LGALS8, MAGI2, and WT1 as hub genes in KIRC, with potential diagnostic and prognostic value. These genes play significant roles in methylation, mutation, and immune regulation in KIRC. However, the results from the limited MN samples suggest possible roles of these genes in MN pathology, but further studies are required to fully assess the relevance of these findings to MN.",

AURKA and AURKB were upregulated in lung cancer tissues compared to normal, while AURKC was downregulated. High expression of AURKA and AURKB was associated with advanced tumor stage and poor survival outcomes in LUAD patients. AURKA and AURKB expression levels correlated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint genes, suggesting potential roles in immunotherapy. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that AURKA and AURKB played crucial roles in promoting proliferation of LUAD cells.

However, the global transcriptional landscape mediated by eccDNA has not yet been extensively profiled. Here we report a comprehensive analysis spanning cancer, non-cancerous disease and health by developing a new approach to catalog eccDNA-driven genes (EDGs). EDG expression is significantly higher than the average level. Our study identifies 27 common EDGs (CEDGs) existing in most cancer types. Integrated analysis of the CEDGs on gene expression, pathway and network, genetic alteration, epigenetic state, single-cell state, immune infiltration, microbiome and clinically-related features reveals their crucial roles in tumorigenesis and clinical significance. A 17-gene CEDG signature and nomogram was constructed to predict pan-cancer patients' outcomes. By a novel eccDriver algorithm, 432 candidate eccDNA-driven drivers were identified. We show the candidate drivers regulate five major biological processes including immune system process, developmental process, metabolic process, cell cycle and division, and regulation of transport. 275 of the 432 candidate drivers are clinically actionable with approved drugs. We also demonstrate that eccDNA generation is associated with DNA methylation. Our study reveals general EDG function in humans and provides the most comprehensive discovery of eccDNA-driven driver genes in cancer and non-cancerous diseases to date for future research and application.",

Despite the critical roles of SWI/SNF in animal development and tumorigenesis, how signaling pathways recruit SWI/SNF complexes to their target genes is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that target gene activation mediated by \u03b2-catenin, the essential transcriptional coactivator in the Wnt signal transduction pathway, requires ubiquitylation of the SWI/SNF component Brahma-related gene-1 (BRG1) by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Thyroid Hormone Receptor Interactor 12 (TRIP12). TRIP12 depletion in Drosophila, zebrafish, mouse organoids, and human cells attenuates Wnt signaling. Genetic epistasis experiments place TRIP12 activity downstream of the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex. TRIP12 interacts with and ubiquitylates BRG1, and BRG1 depletion blocks TRIP12-mediated Wnt pathway activation. TRIP12 promotes BRG1 binding to \u03b2-catenin in the presence of Wnt. Our findings support a model in which TRIP12 ubiquitylates BRG1 in the presence of Wnt and promotes its interaction with \u03b2-catenin in the nucleus, in order to recruit SWI/SNF to Wnt target genes. Our studies suggest a general mechanism by which cell signaling induces the interaction between BRG1 and pathway-specific transcription factors to recruit SWI/SNF complexes to their appropriate target genes.",

Inducible expression of NRF2<sup>E79Q</sup>, a common activating NRF2 mutation, in H358 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells altered cellular morphology and increased xenograft tumor growth in mice but not in 2D cell culture.

Collectively, our findings reveal context-dependent effects of NRF2 activation on the growth and differentiation-state of two human NSCLC models, supporting a role for NRF2 activation in altering the differentiation of human NSCLC during tumor progression.",

However, most currently available methods provide only point estimates, neglecting the quantification of uncertainties, which is essential for both clinical and research applications. This study introduces DeepDeconUQ, a deep neural network model developed to estimate prediction intervals for malignant cell fractions based on bulk RNA-seq data. This approach addresses limitations in current malignant cell fraction estimation methods by integrating uncertainty quantification into predictions of cancer cell fractions. DeepDeconUQ leverages single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in conjunction with conformalized quantile regression to produce reliable prediction intervals. The model trains a quantile regression neural network to establish upper and lower bounds for cancer cell proportions, followed by a calibration step that refines these intervals to ensure both statistical validity (coverage probability) and discrimination (narrow intervals). Benchmark analyses indicate that DeepDeconUQ consistently surpasses existing methods, achieving high coverage accuracy with tight prediction intervals across simulated and real cancer datasets. The robustness of DeepDeconUQ is further demonstrated by its resilience to various gene expression perturbations. The DeepDeconUQ method is publicly accessible at https://github.com/jiaweih14/DeepDeconUQ.",

Finally, we conducted in vitro experiments to validate the effects of ENTR1 on colon cancer proliferation and glycolysis. Our findings reveal that ENTR1 is upregulated in most tumors.

In prostate cancer, indirect cross talk between androgen receptor (AR) and glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1 (also known as GR) is well documented, wherein AR suppression by antiandrogen therapy leads to elevated GR levels, enabling GR to compensate for and replace AR signaling. However, the existence and impact of direct chromatin cross talk between AR and GR in prostate cancer have remained elusive. Here, our genome-wide investigations reveal that AR activation significantly expands GR chromatin binding. Mechanistically, AR induces remodeling of closed chromatin sites, facilitating GR binding to inaccessible sites. Importantly, coactivation of AR and GR results in distinct transcriptional responses at both the cell population and single-cell levels. Pathways affected by these transcriptional changes are generally associated with improved patient survival. Thus, the direct cross talk between AR and GR yields markedly different outcomes from the known role of GR in circumventing AR blockade by antiandrogens.",

Bulk RNA sequencing from GSE60052 and cBioportal cohorts was used to identify metabolism-related gene modules through WGCNA and develop a Gradient Boosting Machine prognostic model. Functional validation of MOCS2, the top-ranked gene in our model, was conducted through siRNA knockdown experiments in SCLC cell lines.

This study investigates eight key genes (BRAF, EIF1 AX, FOXE1, KRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3 CA, PTEN, and TERT) that are deregulated in Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and their roles in thyroid cancer. Cell culture, nucleic acid extraction, RT-qPCR, bisulfite sequencing, and various in silico tools and databases. Expression analysis using RT-qPCR revealed significant (p-value <\u20090.05) down-regulation of BRAF, EIF1 AX, FOXE1, KRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3 CA, PTEN, and TERT genes in thyroid cancer cell lines compared to controls, with ROC curves indicating high diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.93-0.99). Bisulfite sequencing demonstrated increased promoter methylation across all eight genes in cancerous samples, suggesting epigenetic silencing as a regulatory mechanism. Validation through UALCAN, OncoDB, and HPA confirmed reduced gene and protein expression in additional thyroid cancer cohorts. Genetic alteration analysis via cBioPortal showed prevalent BRAF mutations, whereas other genes exhibited fewer alterations. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis linked lower expression of BRAF and PIK3 CA to poorer overall survival. Correlation studies using TISIDB and TISCH2 databases highlighted associations between gene expression and immune modulation, revealing significant correlations with immune cell infiltration and diverse immune subtypes. Moreover, miRNA-mRNA network analysis identified hsa-mir- 628 -\u20095p as a critical regulator targeting these genes. The impact of BRAF overexpression on SW579 cells was assessed through various functional assays. Overexpression of BRAF resulted in reduced cell proliferation, colony formation, and wound healing, which may reflect context-dependent effects. While BRAF is typically oncogenic, its overexpression may lead to cellular stress or negative feedback mechanisms that impair these processes. This comprehensive analysis elucidates the complex regulatory landscape of these genes in thyroid cancer, emphasizing the significant role of epigenetic modifications and providing insights into potential diagnostic and therapeutic avenues.",

          "abstract": "GULP PTB domain containing engulfment adaptor 1 (GULP1) protein is involved in regulating biological processes such as endocytosis and apoptosis. The function of GULP1 in cancer, however, has been the subject of fewer studies; its importance as a potential prognostic factor in pancreatic cancer is still uncertain. Thus, the purpose of this work was to investigate GULP1's immunologic and oncogenic activities in a range of malignancies, as well as any potential relevance to pancreatic cancer. Using multiple bioinformatic databases, GULP1 expression, prognostic significance, mutation status, methylation and phosphorylation levels, biological functions, immune cell infiltration and immunotherapeutic responses and drug sensitivity were comprehensively assessed in pan-cancer and functionally validated in pancreatic cancer. The results revealed that GULP1 was differentially expressed in most tumours and correlated with poor prognostic indicators in most tumours, which may be related to the fact that GULP1 is involved in the regulation of apoptotic pathways. In addition, the differential expression of GULP1 was linked to immune cell infiltration levels, immunotherapy response, and chemotherapy resistance. GULP1 could hinder the body's ability to fight tumors and respond to immunotherapy by promoting the accumulation of immune cells and suppressing the activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In pancreatic cancer, down-regulation of GULP1 expression inhibits proliferation, invasion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells. These phenotypic changes may be achieved by regulating HIPPO, mTOR, and RTK signaling pathways. Taken together, it makes sense to think that GULP1 could be a biomarker for immunotherapy and prognosis in pan- and pancreatic cancer.",

          "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs), distinguished by their abilities to differentiate and self-renew, play a pivotal role in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the mechanisms that sustain CSCs in CRC remain unclear. This study aimed to identify and characterize gene expressions associated with CRC stemness. We applied a 1-class logistic regression machine learning model to calculate the mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi) for CRC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas and cBioPortal databases, adjusting the mRNAsi by tumor purity. Clinical features of CRC were considered in assessing both mRNAsi and adjusted mRNAsi levels. Using DESeq2, we screened differentially expressed genes between high and low mRNAsi groups. Enrichment analysis provided functional annotation for these differentially expressed genes. Key genes linked to mRNAsi were identified using the Kaplan-Meier plotter and Cytoscape software, followed by an evaluation of their prognostic significance. Potential small-molecule compounds targeting the CRC stemness signature were explored via L1000FWD, DGIdb, and CMap databases. CRC samples with higher mRNAsi or adjusted mRNAsi values showed improved disease-free survival (DSS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Strong correlation between clinical characteristics of CSCs and mRNAsi was observed; CMS4 subtype CRC patients had lower mRNAsi with worse DSS and PFS. Ten key genes associated with mRNAsi were identified: collagen type I alpha 1, fibrillin 1, matrix metalloproteinase 9, SPP1, BGN, COL5A1, FN1, elastin, matrix metalloproteinase 2, collagen type I alpha 2. Lower expression of these genes correlated with better PFS and DSS. High correlation among these genes was confirmed in the protein-protein interaction network. This study identifies potential small-molecule drugs targeting stemness in CRC and highlights the prognostic value of the 10 key genes, offering insights into therapeutic targets for CRC treatment.",

The desumoylation enzyme SENP2 is one of the targets of NSC632839. This study aimed to evaluate NSC632839 as an antiproliferative agent in prostate cancer (PCa). Methods: The IC50 values for NSC632839 were determined in PCa cell lines PC3 and LNCaP and normal fibroblast cells CCD-1072Sk by crystal violet staining. The colony- formation ability of PC3 and LNCaP cells upon NSC632839 treatment was evaluated by a 2D colony-formation assay. The expression level of SENP2 and its correlation with androgen receptor (AR) were investigated in PCa tissue samples using publicly avail- able datasets. Results: The IC50 values of NSC632839 were 3.1, 1.9, and 17.7 for LNCaP, PC3, and CCD- 1072Sk, respectively. In this IC50 concentration, NSC632839 completely abolished the colony-formation ability of PC3 cells. The expression level of SENP2 was elevated in metastatic PCa tissue samples and was correlated with the AR. Conclusion: NSC632839 was an antiproliferative agent in PCa cells at low doses. Therefore, NSC632839 is a strong drug candidate requiring further studies.",

          "abstract": "Exosomes shape the tumor microenvironment (TME) by modulating tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and promoting ovarian cancer (OC) progression. This study reveals that exosomal CKLF Like MARVEL Transmembrane Domain Containing 4 (CMTM4) enhances OC malignancy and orchestrates immune evasion. Excessive macrophage infiltration in the TME, particularly in the presence of CMTM4, is strongly associated with poor prognosis. Within the TME, exosomal CMTM4 is actively internalized by macrophages, promoting M2 polarization and subsequently initiating immunosuppressive signaling. Exosomal CMTM4 activates the NF-\u03baB pathway in TAMs, suppressing immune function through enhanced secretion of cytokines, including TGF-\u03b21 and CXCL12, while simultaneously upregulating intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) expression to further promote M2 polarization and facilitate cancer metastasis. Depletion of CMTM4 increases sensitivity to anti-PD-1 therapy by reversing immunosuppression. Notably, eltrombopag is identified as a CMTM4 inhibitor that attenuates OC progression in vivo and modulates the tumor immune microenvironment, synergizing with PD-1 blockade immunotherapy to enhance therapeutic efficacy. The exosomal CMTM4-ICAM1-CD206 axis exacerbates disease risk in patients with OC. Collectively, the study highlights the critical role of tumor-derived exosomal CMTM4 in immune suppression, emphasizing its potential as both a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target in OC immunotherapy.",

Currently, there are no mature tools for the identification of TCNEs. To compensate for the lack of a systematic interpretation of the functional characterization and regulatory mechanisms of TCNE spatiotemporal activities, we developed a flexible pipeline, called captureTCNE, to depict the landscape of TCNEs and applied it to our breast cancer cohort (SEU-BRCA). Meanwhile, we investigated the genome-wide characteristics of TCNEs and unraveled that TCNEs harbor enhancer-like chromatin signatures as well as participate in the transcriptional machinery to regulate essential genes or architect biological regulatory networks of breast cancer. Specifically, the TCNE transcripts could recruit RBPs, such as ENOX1 and PTBP1, which are involved in gene expression regulation, to participate in the formation of regulatory networks and the association with altered splicing patterns. In particular, the presence of a non-classical secondary structure, called RNA G-quadruplex, on TCNE transcripts contributed to the recruitment of RBPs associated with subtype-specific transcriptional processes related to the estrogen response in breast cancer. Ultimately, we also analyzed the mutational signatures of variant-containing TCNEs and discerned twenty-one genes as essential components of the regulatory mechanism of TCNEs in breast cancer. Our study provides an effective TCNE identification pipeline and insights into the regulatory mechanisms of TCNEs in breast cancer, contributing to further knowledge of TCNEs and the emergence of innovative therapeutic strategies for breast cancer.",

Prostate cancer (PCa), particularly in its aggressive forms, may be a suitable target for CAR-T therapy given the range of associated tumor antigens. However, due to the high plasticity and heterogeneity of aggressive PCa and the complexity of the tumor environment, there is a need to broaden the repertoire of targetable antigens and deepen our understanding of CAR-T behavior in stressed microenvironmental conditions.

The datasets explored were Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (TCGA, Nature 2013), Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (IRC, Nat Genet 2014), Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (TCGA, Firehose Legacy), Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas). Data mining from various datasets revealed that VHL is the most mutated gene, with mutation frequencies of 79.5%, 51.2%, 49.9%, and 41.3% across different datasets: Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (IRC, Nat Genet 2014), Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (TCGA, Nature 2013), Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (TCGA, Firehose Legacy), and Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas), respectively. The mutated VHL gene is associated with significantly reduced overall survival (OS) rates based on the analyses of these datasets.

          "abstract": "Gliomas, particularly IDH-wildtype astrocytomas, remain highly aggressive and resistant to current therapies. Despite advances in molecular classification, effective therapeutic targets are still limited. Consequently, identifying new targets is essential to improve patient survival. PTPN7, a tyrosine phosphatase implicated in MAPK signaling, is known to play roles in various malignancies but remains underexplored in gliomas. This study examines the prognostic significance, spatial distribution, and immune-related functions of PTPN7, aiming to elucidate its potential as a prognostic role and therapeutic target in glioma treatment. We analyzed PTPN7 mRNA expression in gliomas via TCGA, CGGA, and single-cell RNA sequencing (GSE131928 and GSE89567). Kaplan determined prognostic significance-Meier and uni-/multi-variate Cox survival analyses. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to identify dysregulated pathways, immune signatures, and cell-type enrichments. We also applied CIBERSORT to evaluate the relationships between PTPN7 expression and 12-principal cell states and 22 immune populations. Spatial transcriptomics (Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas, 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009Genomics Visium) mapped PTPN7 distribution; these findings were corroborated by immunohistochemistry-validated protein expression in 70 cases. Pan-cancer analysis revealed PTPN7 overexpression in multiple malignancies, including glioma. Notably, PTPN7 was significantly elevated in IDH-wildtype astrocytomas, correlating with higher tumor grades and poorer overall survival. GSEA indicated that high PTPN7 is linked to T-cell differentiation, macrophage/monocyte activation, and dendritic cell-associated pathways. Both immune deconvolution and single-cell analyses showed that PTPN7 positively correlates with myeloid series and T-cell populations, supported by additional GSEA findings. In the Ivy dataset and spatial transcriptomics, PTPN7 was concentrated in peri-necrotic, cellular tumor, and slightly lower in the infiltrating border regions, consistent with immune interaction sites. Immunohistochemical data further demonstrated high PTPN7 expression tracks with increased tumor grade, reaching statistical significance in IDH-wildtype astrocytomas and confirming its clinical relevance. This study positions PTPN7 as a prognostic biomarker and immune modulator in gliomas, particularly IDH-wildtype astrocytomas. Its expression correlates with tumor aggressiveness and immune infiltration, potentially driving glioma progression. Targeting PTPN7 may disrupt immune evasion and support tumor eradication, indicating a promising therapeutic avenue in immunotherapy-based strategies.",

          "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, largely due to the limitations of current clinical strategies for its treatment. As a result, identifying genetic alterations and potential therapeutic targets could offer new opportunities for improving the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer. The identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and subsequent analyses, including signaling pathway enrichment, functional classification, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, were conducted using three public datasets: GSE32676, GSE71989, and GSE16515. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were employed to investigate the correlation between hub genes and clinicopathological features in pancreatic cancer patients. Genetic alterations were analyzed using the CBioPortal web tool. Cell proliferation was assessed through CCK-8, colony formation, and EdU assays. Tumor migration, invasion, and angiogenesis were evaluated using transwell and tube formation assays, respectively. Protein and mRNA expression levels were measured via western blot analysis and qPCR assays. The subcutaneous xenografted nude mice models were generated to evaluate the potential effect of miR-485-3p/MELK cascade on tumor growth in vivo. Our analysis revealed that MELK expression is positively correlated with poor prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer. The overexpression or knockdown of MELK significantly influences cell proliferation, tumor metastasis, and angiogenesis across various pancreatic cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we identified that miR-485-3p regulates MELK expression by directly targeting the MELK 3'UTR binding site in pancreatic cancer cells, which subsequently impacts tumor progression. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that the miR-485-3p/MELK cascade is closely associated with tumor progression in pancreatic cancer cells. Mechanistically, the miR-485-3p/MELK cascade promotes the phosphorylation of Akt to regulate pancreatic cancer cell progression, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-485-3p inhibits the tumor growth induced by MELK overexpression in subcutaneous xenograft model. MiR-485-3p/MELK cascade may serve as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer.",

          "abstract": "Genomic alterations in tumor cells can influence immune response, as has been demonstrated in several tumor types. For instance, mutations in certain genes like EGFR or B-RAF are associated with a particular immune phenotype. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most immunogenic tumors, but certain genomic alterations can modulate and influence immune response. In the present work, we explore the transcriptomic landscape and immunologic profile of NSCLC with molecular alterations in SMARCA4. Using the TCGA repository we exploited their analysis with R and other available packages. cBioPortal was used to explore and analyze the mutational profile present in those tumors The prognostic value of identified genes in patients treated with immunotherapy was evaluated using the KMplotter online tool, and for correlations with immune populations TIMER 2.0 was interrogated. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) disruptive mutations in SMARCA4 were presented in 8%, and 4% of the cases, respectively. Gene deletions were observed in 1% of the population. The transcriptomic profile in LUAD and LUSC with deletions or disruptive mutations was explored. Interrogating TCGA using a 2.5 gene expression fold change (FC) we observed five genes commonly upregulated, and thirty-one genes commonly decreased when SMARCA4 was mutated or CNV loss was present. Enriched biological functions for downregulated genes included \"Antigen processing and presentation, endogenous lipid antigen via MHC class Ib. Expression of CD1A, CD1C, CD1E, CX3CR1, and MYO1G showed a strong positive correlation with dendritic cells (DC) and dendritic cells resting (DCR). The increased expression of gene signatures formed by these transcripts resulted in a better prognosis in a set of patients with different tumors treated with anti-PD1 therapies, including 21 non-small cell lung cancers. We evaluated genomic alterations and transcriptomic patterns of SMARCA4 alterations in NSCLC tumors, identifying a relevant immunologic downregulated gene set linked with antigen presentation that predicts response to anti-PD1 therapies.",

          "abstract": "The rising mortality rate from cancer, driven by the absence of reliable biomarkers, highlights the pressing need for advanced diagnostic and prognostic strategies. This study investigates LZTS2's role as a pan-cancer biomarker, emphasizing its predictive value for immunotherapy and therapeutic targeting. Unlike existing biomarkers such as AFP in hepatocellular carcinoma or HER2 in gastric cancer, which exhibit tissue-specific utility, LZTS2 demonstrates unique cross-cancer applicability, as evidenced by its consistent dysregulation in both liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) alongside emerging associations with other malignancies. Leveraging advanced bioinformatics tools and databases including UALCAN, KM-plotter, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), alongside experimental validation in LIHC and STAD cell lines, we analyze LZTS2 expression patterns and their clinical relevance. Notably, LZTS2's dual role-acting as a tumor suppressor in some cancers while promoting oncogenesis in others-distinguishes it from conventional single-function markers, offering novel insights into its regulatory versatility. Our findings reveal that LZTS2 mutations and expression levels are closely associated with cancer progression and patient survival, solidifying its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Notably, LZTS2 expression correlates with various clinicopathological parameters, underscoring its significance in cancer biology. Pathway analysis highlights LZTS2's involvement in critical biological processes, providing actionable insights for therapeutic interventions. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) experimental validations confirm these results, further establishing LZTS2's utility as a multi-dimensional biomarker that integrates genetic, epigenetic, and immunological features-a capability rarely observed in existing markers. This comprehensive analysis positions LZTS2 as a pivotal player in cancer progression, opening promising avenues for enhanced clinical management.",

          "abstract": "Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a non-enveloped virus with a circular double-stranded DNA genome. It is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections, with high-risk types such as HPV-16 and HPV-18 linked to anogenital and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). HNSCC includes cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and related regions, caused by carcinogens or persistent viral infections. HPV-positive (HPV+) HNSCC cases are more prevalent in Western countries and exhibit better prognosis and treatment response compared to HPV-negative (HPV-) cases. These differences suggest distinct fundamental differences between each subtype. This study analyzed RNA-seq data from the PanCancer Atlas 2018 dataset to investigate molecular distinctions between HPV\u2009+\u2009and HPV- HNSCC. Using dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), a clear clustering of HPV\u2009+\u2009cases was observed, suggesting a unique gene expression profile. HPV\u2009+\u2009tumors exhibited upregulation of genes involved in nucleic acid processing and downregulation of genes associated with apoptosis and epidermis development. These findings underscore the biological differences between HPV\u2009+\u2009and HPV- HNSCC, offering insights into HPV-driven oncogenesis. Understanding these distinctions may improve patient stratification and inform targeted therapeutic strategies for HNSCC.",

          "abstract": "Accurate characterization of cellular states is the foundation for precise prediction of drug sensitivity in cancer cell lines, which in turn is fundamental to realizing precision oncology. However, current deep learning approaches have limitations in characterizing cellular states. They rely solely on isolated genetic markers, overlooking the complex regulatory networks and cellular mechanisms that underlie drug responses. To address this limitation, this work proposes DeepCCDS, a Deep learning framework for Cancer Cell Drug Sensitivity prediction through Characterizing Cancer Driver Signals. DeepCCDS incorporates a prior knowledge network to characterize cancer driver signals, building upon the self-supervised neural network framework. The signals can reflect key mechanisms influencing cancer cell development and drug response, enhancing the model's predictive performance and interpretability. DeepCCDS has demonstrated superior performance in predicting drug sensitivity compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches across multiple datasets. Benefiting from integrating prior knowledge, DeepCCDS exhibits powerful feature representation capabilities and interpretability. Based on these feature representations, we have identified embedding features that could potentially be used for drug screening in new indications. Further, this work demonstrates the applicability of DeepCCDS on solid tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. This work believes integrating DeepCCDS into clinical decision-making processes can potentially improve the selection of personalized treatment strategies for cancer patients.",

          "abstract": "Tamoxifen is most often used as the first treatment for luminal A breast cancer; however, one-third of the patients are resistant to it. Numerous studies have shown that hypoxia contributes to drug resistance and is related to poor clinical outcomes. Despite this, little is known regarding the key hypoxic mediators involved in tamoxifen resistance. We performed a comprehensive multi-omics analysis using publicly available transcriptomics and whole-exome sequencing data from tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant luminal A breast cancer patient samples. EPAS1 was identified as a key hypoxic mediator linked to endocrine resistance in luminal A breast cancer. In vitro assays, including Western blotting, hypoxia detection assays, and CCK8 assays, were conducted to validate the association between EPAS1 expression and tamoxifen resistance in cell lines. Additionally, we tested the effect of PT2977 (Belzutifan), an EPAS1 inhibitor, as a potential treatment for tamoxifen resistance using tamoxifen-resistant and control cells, followed by validation in xenograft models of tamoxifen-resistant tumours. Patient and cell line data revealed that EPAS1 is significantly upregulated in tamoxifen-resistant luminal A breast cancer, which is associated with poor survival outcomes and an altered tumour microenvironment. Further investigation using tamoxifen-resistant cell lines confirmed elevated EPAS1 expression levels. In vitro treatment with the EPAS1 inhibitor PT2977 resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability and modulated hypoxia-related pathways, indicating a potential therapeutic effect. Furthermore, in vivo studies showed that PT2977 reduced the growth of tamoxifen-resistant cells under the experimental conditions used. This study suggests that PT2977, by targeting the hypoxic gene EPAS1, has the potential to inhibit the growth of tamoxifen-resistant luminal A breast cancer. However, while PT2977 demonstrated effectiveness in reducing tumour growth under the experimental conditions used, further studies are necessary to evaluate its role in overcoming hormone resistance and to explore its therapeutic applicability in broader clinical settings and other cancer subtypes.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer ranks as the foremost cause of cancer-related mortality among women globally. Timely diagnosis stands as the most effective approach in mitigating breast cancer mortality rates. There exists a close relationship between immune processes and tumorigenesis. This study aims to elucidate the immune mechanisms and potential biomarkers associated with breast cancer using bioinformatics techniques. Initially, differentially expressed genes were identified through consensus analysis of invasive breast cancer (BRCA) samples sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, focusing on immunotherapy response. Subsequently, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were employed to refine the selection of potential genes. Lastly, expression and prognostic analyses of hub genes were conducted to identify reliable key genes, with a focus on CCL19. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to assess the differential expression of CCL19 in both tumor and adjacent breast tissue samples. Additionally, protein correlation analysis, signaling pathway analysis, immune infiltration analysis, gene co-expression analysis, and drug sensitivity analysis of CCL19 were conducted to investigate its pathological clinical features and potential biological functions. CCL19 expression exhibited a significant increase in breast cancer. Elevated CCL19 expression correlates with advanced tumor stage and indicates a favorable prognosis in breast cancer. CCL19 expression correlates with the abundance of diverse tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs). CCL19 exhibits a positive correlation with the expression of the majority of immune-related genes. Enrichment analysis revealed the involvement of CCL19 in immune-related pathways and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. These findings suggest that CCL19 may influence breast cancer prognosis through immune infiltration. Patients exhibiting high CCL19 expression demonstrated more favorable responses to immunotherapy. Breast cancer demonstrates overexpression of CCL19. CCL19 holds promise as a biomarker for forecasting breast cancer prognosis and as a potential therapeutic target.",

We employed some databases, such as TCGA, GTEx, TIMER, GEPIA2, cBioportal, and GSCALite, to study AUNIP gene expression, prognosis, gene variation, and drug sensitivity. The relationship between AUNIP and clinicopathological information was explored using Wilcoxon test.

Moreover, we conducted immunohistochemistry (IHC) to investigate AUNIP difference expression between liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and normal tissues. The Chisq test was used to study the correlation of AUNIP with clinical characteristics. AUNIP was highly expressed in majority of tumors and IHC analysis demonstrated that AUNIP expression was higher in LIHC than normal tissues. AUNIP overexpression had adverse outcomes in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), brain lower grade glioma (LGG), LIHC, mesothelioma (MESO), and sarcoma (SARC). Furthermore, high AUNIP expression led to unfavorable prognosis in LIHC. AUNIP was associated with T stage, N stage, and clinicopathological analysis in several cancers and AUNIP expression had a correlation with histologic grade in LIHC by IHC.

GD3 synthase (GD3S/ST8SIA1), a gene associated with breast cancer stem cells, is upregulated in tumors with p53 mutations. However, the functional relationship between GD3S and p53 is unknown. Here, we show that GD3S levels are highest in breast tumors with specific p53 mutations. Functional studies revealed that wild-type (WT) p53 inhibits GD3S expression, whereas mutation in p53 enhances GD3S expression by upregulating GD3S promoter activity. Moreover, we found that GD3S inhibits wild-type p53-induced apoptosis in BC cells, while BC cells harboring gain-of-function p53 mutations are dependent on GD3S for their growth. Mechanistic insights indicate that GD3S strengthens mitochondrial function by regulating their oxygen consumption rate and membrane polarity. Our findings demonstrate that specific GOF p53 mutations rely on GD3S to exert their tumor-promoting effects and that GD3S is a novel anti-apoptotic factor in BC cells. Stabilizing WT p53 and reducing mutant p53 levels downregulates GD3S expression, thereby augmenting apoptosis. GD3S overexpression counteracts the cell death triggered by WT p53 stabilization in BC cells, as well as that triggered by p53 knockdown in cells with specific GOF p53 mutations, which suggests that GD3S helps confer apoptosis resistance.",

          "abstract": "The CD47/SIRP\u03b1 axis conveys a 'don't eat me' signal, thereby thwarting the phagocytic clearance of tumor cells. Although blocking antibodies targeting CD47 have demonstrated promising anti-tumor effects in preclinical models, clinical trials involving human cancer patients have not yielded ideal results. Exploring the regulatory mechanisms of CD47 is imperative for devising more efficacious combinational therapies. Here, we report that inhibiting USP2 prompts CD47 degradation and reshapes the tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby enhancing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Mechanistically, USP2 interacts with CD47, stabilizing it through deubiquitination. USP2 inhibition destabilizes CD47, thereby boosting macrophage phagocytosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing shows USP2 inhibition reprograms TME, evidenced by increasing M1 macrophages and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells while reducing M2 macrophages. Combining ML364 with anti-PD-1 reduces tumor burden in mouse models. Clinically, low USP2 expression predicts a better response to anti-PD-1 treatment. Our findings uncover the regulatory mechanism of CD47 by USP2 and targeting this axis boosts anti-tumor immunity.",

We utilized datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and identified CLTA, EDIL3, HAPLN1, and HIP1 as hub genes common to both TC and HT. These genes were significantly upregulated in TC cell lines compared to normal controls, with high diagnostic accuracy as indicated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Further validation using the TCGA TC dataset revealed their significant upregulation in tumor tissues, particularly in advanced TC stages. Promoter methylation analysis indicated hypomethylation of these genes in TC, suggesting a role of methylation in their regulation. We also observed mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) in these hub genes, with CLTA and HIP1 showing significant amplifications, which may contribute to their overexpression in tumor samples. In addition, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the impact of these genes on survival outcomes in TC patients, with results indicating that higher expression of HAPLN1 and HIP1 was associated with poor survival. Our study also highlighted the involvement of CLTA and EDIL3 in activating the Rap1 signaling pathway, crucial for cancer cell migration, proliferation, and invasion. These findings emphasize the potential of CLTA, EDIL3, HAPLN1, and HIP1 as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for TC and HT.",

However, only a subset of these patients responds favorably, highlighting the need for strategies to improve immunotherapy efficacy. To identify potential regulators of immunotherapy response, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We performed multi-omics analyses and functional assays in both human and murine colorectal cancer cell lines. Additionally, we evaluated tumor growth and immune cell infiltration using syngeneic mouse models. Our analysis revealed that RNA binding motif protein 15 (RBM15) is highly expressed in colorectal cancer and correlates with poor patient prognosis. Functional studies demonstrated that RBM15 loss led to increased expression of fumarate hydratase (FH). This led to decreased levels of fumarate, a metabolite known to suppress anti-tumor immune responses. <i>In vivo</i>, RBM15 depletion significantly delayed tumor progression and enhanced CD8\u207a T cell infiltration and activation in the tumor microenvironment. These findings identify RBM15 as a negative regulator of anti-tumor immunity in colorectal cancer.

While cigarette smoking is the major preventable factor for cancers in general and lung cancer in particular, old age is also a major risk factor. Aging-related chronic, low-level inflammation, termed inflammaging, has been widely documented; however, it remains unclear how inflammaging contributes to increased lung cancer incidence. The aim of this study was to establish connections between aging-associated changes in the lungs and cancer risk. We analyzed public databases of gene expression for normal and cancerous human lungs and used mouse models to understand which changes were dependent on inflammation, as well as to assess the impact on oncogenesis. Analyses of GTEx and TCGA databases comparing gene expression profiles from normal lungs, lung adenocarcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma of subjects across age groups revealed upregulated pathways such as inflammatory response, TNFA signaling via NF\u03baB, and interferon-gamma response. Similar pathways were identified comparing the gene expression profiles of young and old mouse lungs. Transgenic expression of alpha 1 antitrypsin (AAT) partially reverses increases in markers of aging-associated inflammation and immune deregulation. Using an orthotopic model of lung cancer using cells derived from EML4-ALK fusion-induced adenomas, we demonstrated an increased tumor outgrowth in lungs of old mice while NLRP3 knockout in old mice decreased tumor volumes, suggesting that inflammation contributes to increased lung cancer development in aging organisms. These studies reveal how expression of an anti-inflammatory mediator (AAT) can reduce some but not all aging-associated changes in mRNA and protein expression in the lungs. We further show that aging is associated with increased tumor outgrowth in the lungs, which may relate to an increased inflammatory microenvironment.",

While well-known Ras-related oncogenes, such as KRAS, have been extensively explored, the role of other Ras-related genes in cancer remains poorly studied. Dexamethasone-induced Ras-related protein 1 (RASD1), a member of the Ras superfamily, is widely expressed across various tissues and is involved in inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis, suggesting a potential role as a tumor suppressor. Here, we investigated RASD1 expression across multiple tissues and cancers, utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Human Protein Atlas, and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases. Our analysis revealed a significant downregulation of RASD1 mRNA expression in several cancer types compared to normal tissues, correlating with low levels of promoter methylation. Interestingly, high RASD1 expression correlated with a favorable prognosis in multiple cancers. Immune cell infiltration analysis indicated that elevated RASD1 expression is associated with an increased infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and myeloid-derived dendritic cells in cancer. Furthermore, the expression of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns as RASD1 suggest that RASD1 may play a role in interleukin-4-mediated apoptosis and could regulate the transcription of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene. Overall, these findings suggest that RASD1 may modulate immune signaling and tumor suppressive pathways.",

          "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the malignancies with the worst prognosis, and there have been no major breakthroughs in its treatment for a long time. The majority of patients are diagnosed at the extensive stage, where the only option is chemotherapy, and even the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors results in only modest benefits. The characterization of the molecular mechanisms behind therapy resistance has relevance in finding novel therapeutic approaches. Previous studies showed the possibility of annexin A1's (ANXA1) involvement in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in SCLC, and there are studies showing the direct effects of ANXA1 modulation on cancer cell aggressiveness. We aimed to characterize the roles of ANXA1 expression using publicly available transcriptomic data, the RNA-seq-based predictive algorithms EPIC and ESTIMATE, and immunohistochemistry on patient samples. For the in vitro studies, we silenced ANXA1 expression with short hairpin RNA in three SCLC cell lines, measured the growth rate with the trypan blue exclusion assay, assessed the chemosensitivity to cisplatin and etoposide with the Presto Blue<sup>TM</sup> viability assay, and performed Western blots to assess changes in the levels of metabolic and mesenchymal markers and transcriptional drivers. ANXA1-high tumors are associated with significantly increased immune infiltrates, stromality, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). The ANXA1 protein is expressed on tumor cells and TAMs at the tissue level. ANXA1 silencing in H841 cells did not affect the growth rate; in SW1271 cells, shANXA1 cells grew significantly slower than shCTRL cells. Meanwhile, in H1048 cells, proliferation was significantly faster. Despite the different growth rates of the tested cell lines, ANXA1 silencing decreased the chemosensitivity to both cisplatin and etoposide in all three cell lines. Gene expression changes in mesenchymal markers, metabolic markers, dominant transcriptional drivers, and immune-relevant molecules were also characterized. This is the first comprehensive characterization of ANXA1 in SCLC to reveal its role in the tumor's cell biology and the TME, aiming to boost further research in the field.",

Here, we provide genetic evidence supporting that CHD1 loss accelerates disease progression and confers resistance to castration in males with SPOP-mutated PCa. By leveraging genetic engineering and multiomics, we uncovered a noncanonical function of CHD1 in lipid metabolism reprogramming via repressing the SREBP2 transcriptome. Loss of CHD1 induces cholesterol production, supplies intratumoral androgen biosynthesis and enhances AR activity, leading to castration resistance of SPOP-mutated PCa. Combining anti-androgen therapy with cholesterol-lowering drugs showed synergistic and durable activity against CRPC harboring CHD1 loss and SPOP mutations.

The present study aimed to analyze the clinical and genetic characteristics of RIMs to increase understanding of the tumorigenesis and prognosis of RIMs. We investigated a database of 24 patients who met the RIM criteria between January 2000 and April 2023. Genetic analysis through next-generation sequencing with a targeted gene panel was performed on 10 RIM samples. Clinical, radiological, and pathological parameters were evaluated with genetic analyses. The median ages for receiving radiotherapy (RT) and RIM diagnosis were 8.0 and 27.5 years, respectively, with an interval of 17.5 years between RT and RIM diagnosis. RIMs tended to develop in non-skull bases and multifocal locations. Most primary pathologies included germ cell tumors and medulloblastoma. The tumor growth rate was 3.83 cm\u00b3 per year, and the median doubling time was 0.8 years. All patients underwent surgical resection of RIMs. The histological grade of RIMs was World Health Organization grade 1 (64%) or 2 (36%). RIMs showed higher incidences in young-age (63%), high-dose (75%), and extended-field (79%) RT groups. The recurrence rate was 21%. Genetic analysis revealed <i>NF2</i> one copy loss in 90% of the patients, with truncating <i>NF2</i> mutations and additional copy number aberrations in grade 2 RIMs. <i>TERT</i> promoter mutation and <i>CDKN2A/B</i> deletion were not identified. Notably, loss of H3K27me3 was identified in 26% of RIMs. H3K27me3 loss was associated with a higher prevalence of grade 2 RIMs (67%) and high recurrence rates (33%). The study reveals a higher prevalence of high-grade tumors among RIMs with more rapid growth and higher recurrences than SMs. Genetically, RIMs are primarily associated with <i>NF-2</i> alterations with chromosomal abnormalities in grade 2 tumors, along with a higher proportion of H3K27me3 loss.",

Finally, we conducted <i>in vitro</i> experiments to validate the effects of SF3B6 on the proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression of liver cancer cells.

The elevated expression of SF3B6 demonstrated predictive value for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and responses to immunotherapy. Functional enrichment analysis suggests that SF3B6 was closely associated with pathways related to tumor immunity, tumor metabolism, and cell cycle. Additionally, high SF3B6 expression was an independent risk factor for overall survival and correlated with poor alpha-fetoprotein levels, pathological grading, clinical staging, and reduced responses to sorafenib and transarterial chemoembolization treatment in HCC. Interestingly, SF3B6 was associated with variant splicing isotypes of genes involved in the G2M checkpoint and DNA repair pathways, including NEIL3, NEK2, KIF4A, TROAP, and FANCD2. Moreover, SF3B6 was highly expressed in liver cancer cells, promoting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells, inhibiting apoptosis, and regulating the transition from the S phase to the G2M phase of the cell cycle. We emphasize that SF3B6 has the potential to serve as a biomarker for predicting cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and immunotherapy responses, especially in HCC. SF3B6 and its related alternative splicing isoforms promote the occurrence and progression of HCC and may serve as potential therapeutic targets.",

          "abstract": "The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains challenging, and immune activation plays a critical role in cancer treatment. Identifying reliable immune activation-related prognostic markers is critical for predicting HCC patient outcomes. A six-gene signature was developed. The prognostic value was assessed by correlating the signature and survival. The robustness of the signature was validated in three independent Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Associations with clinical, genomic, and transcriptomic features were also evaluated. Additionally, single-cell sequencing data were analyzed to explore cell-cell interaction heterogeneity reflected by the signature. The biological role of candidate gene RORC was investigated, including chemotherapy resistance and detailed regulatory mechanism in affecting progression. The clinical potential role of RORC and its downstream gene was also evaluated by immunohistochemical (IHC) microarray. The six-gene signature stratified patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, with high-risk samples exhibiting significantly shorter overall survival (median: 23.8 months, 95% CI: 20.6-41.8) than low-risk samples (median: 83.2 months, 95% CI: 69.6-NA, p < 0.001). Validation in independent GEO datasets confirmed the robustness of the signature. The signature was significantly associated with the pathological stage and negatively correlated with PD-L1 expression, outperforming clinical indicators in predicting 3-year survival. The signature was significantly associated with TP53 mutations, genomic stability, and canonical cancer-related pathways. Single-cell sequencing data indicated that the signature revealed cell-cell interaction heterogeneity in HCC. Candidate gene RORC promotes proliferation and migration by regulating CDC6 gene expression as a transcription factor. Furthermore, RORC is also associated with multiple drug resistance, especially docetaxel and paclitaxel. IHC revealed that RORC and candidate gene CDC6 were valuable predictive biomarkers for prognosis. The six-gene signature provides valuable insights into the biological status of HCC patients and is a robust tool for clinical application.",

Our analyses identified sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1), a novel protein regulated by 183- and 1000-kDa HA. Utilising online databases and high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patient tissue microarray cohorts, we assessed the relationship between SPHK1 expression and ovarian cancer metastasis, recurrence and patient outcome. We assessed the effects of the HA synthesis inhibitor 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) on SPHK1 expression in ovarian cancer cells and HGSOC patient tissues using ex\u00a0vivo tissue explant assays. SPHK1 was significantly increased in ovarian cancer compared to normal tissues, elevated in metastatic and recurrent HGSOC tissues and associated with poor patient outcome. 4-MU significantly inhibited SPHK1 expression in ovarian cancer cells (ES-2, CaOV3 and A2780) and HGSOC patient tissues. This study highlights a link between HA and SPHK1 expression in ovarian cancer. Our findings confirm an adverse effect on ovarian cancer prognosis.

However, how U2AF1 contributes to the formation and regulation of different categories of chimeric RNAs remains elusive. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the involvement of U2AF1 in chimeric RNA formation and its regulatory impact on different categories of chimeric RNA. Employing knockdown and overexpression strategies in leukemia and esophageal cancer cell lines, we conducted paired-end RNA sequencing following U2AF1 knockdown to assess transcriptomic alterations and their influence on alternative splicing patterns. Subsequently, we utilized the SOAPfuse algorithm to detect and characterize chimeric RNAs from the paired-end RNA sequencing data. Our findings unveiled significant changes in the landscape of chimeric RNA upon U2AF1 knockdown, highlighting its critical role in chimeric RNA formation. This study provides novel insights into how U2AF1 mediates chimeric RNA formation and regulates distinct categories of chimeric RNA within leukemia cell lines.

However, its functional characterization and clinical significance remain insufficiently explored in cancers such as Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC). Therefore, comprehensive pan-cancer analysis and mechanistic investigation are necessary for optimizing LMO2-targeted immunotherapy strategies. We conducted comprehensive multi-omics analyses and clinicopathological correlation studies across all cancers using TCGA data and specialized bioinformatics tools. Immune microenvironment associations were evaluated through Pearson correlation coefficients and TIMER algorithm validation. Subsequent functional enrichment analyses and predictive regulator identification were performed to delineate signaling pathways in ccRCC. Mechanistic insights were validated through in vitro models and xenograft experiments. LMO2 demonstrates significant deregulation across multiple malignancies, with its mRNA expression exhibiting distinct correlations with clinical staging, survival outcomes, and tumor immune microenvironment characteristics. Systematic analysis further confirmed it as a potentially novel immunotherapeutic target. Mechanistic investigations revealed that ZC3H13 depletion mediates LMO2 downregulation through N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-dependent epigenetic modifications. Through comprehensive functional validation in ccRCC, we established LMO2's tumor-suppressive properties using both in vitro models and xenograft assays. Subsequent pathway investigation demonstrated that LMO2 exerts its anti-tumor effects through direct modulation of the NF-\u03baB signaling cascade via the GATA2-BEX1 regulatory axis. Our findings establish substantial evidence for LMO2 as both a potential therapeutic candidate in cancer immunotherapy and a significant prognostic modulator in ccRCC pathogenesis. The mechanistic characterization of LMO2's tumor-suppressive functions warrants heightened translational consideration in both clinical management strategies and molecular etiology research.",

In the HHM cohort, 57 probands had germline P/LP CHEK2 variants, mostly p.I157T (53%, 30/57).

This study also investigated Gper1 signalling in the CRC cell lines DLD1 and LoVo, which differ in the p53 pathway. In cancer tissue, Gper1 becomes by far the most abundant E2 receptor due to an increase in Gper1 and a decrease in ESR2 expression. These changes are more prominent in males than in females. More pronounced differences in <i>Gper1</i> expression between cancer and adjacent tissues were observed in males in lower stages compared with those in higher stages of disease and females. High expression of <i>Gper1</i> was associated with worse survival in males without nodal involvement but not in females. The expression of E2 receptors in the CRC cell lines DLD1 and LoVo resembles that of human cancer tissue. Silencing of Gper1 (siGper1) caused an increase in the rate of metabolism in LoVo cells with wild-type <i>tp53</i>. In DLD1 cells with the mutated form of <i>tp53</i>, siGper1 did not exert this effect. High levels of Gper1 were associated with worse survival and could contribute to sex-dependent changes in the CRC prognosis. Tumour suppressor effects of Gper1 were, at least to some extent, dependent on signalling downstream of p53, which was more frequently deficient in males than in females. Overall, this suggests that up-regulation of Gper1 (or administration of a Gper1 agonist) would be more beneficial for patients with wild-type <i>tp53</i>.",

However, their molecular role in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) has not been systematically explored. Using bioinformatic tools, we systematically analyzed the expression, prognostic value and drug sensitivity of the PRDX gene family members in LUAD. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to verify the expression of PRDX1 in both LUAD tissues and cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was applied to detect the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of osimertinib in LUAD. A series of cellular drug assays, including 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), colony formation, and apoptosis assays, were performed to explore the correlation of PRDX1 with epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) sensitivity by using EGFR-mutant and wild-type LUAD cell lines. Among all the PRDX family members, PRDX1 has a promising prognostic value and is associated with EGFR mutations, as verified by experiments conducted on collected LUAD specimens. In addition, pathway enrichment analysis suggested that PRDX1 expression positively correlated with DNA repair, which is often considered to be inextricably linked to drug resistance in tumor cells. Thus, we validated the correlation between PRDX1 and EGFR-TKI sensitivity through a series of <i>in vitro</i> experiments and found that PRDX1 inhibition along with osimertinib treatment resulted in synergistic inhibition of tumor growth. Moreover, we found that PRDX1 was negatively correlated with the immune infiltration of dendritic cells (DCs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of LUAD, further suggesting an oncogenic role of PRDX1. This study demonstrates that high PRDX1 expression could be a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker of LUAD, and the strategy of PRDX1 knockdown provides new insights into improving the therapeutic sensitivity of EGFR-TKI in patients with LUAD.",

However, there no reports describing its prognostic and immunological roles in pan-cancer. This study evaluated the association of GJB5 in various cancer types by a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis. The differential GJB5 expression in tumor and adjacent tissues acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases was compared. Furthermore, univariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to assess the influence of GJB5 on the disease-specific survival (DSS), disease-free interval (DFI), clinical stage, progression-free interval (PFI), and overall survival (OS) in various cancers. Moreover, the levels of GJB5 and its activity in the tumor microenvironment were assessed via the Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub (TISCH). In addition, the biological importance of GJB5 levels in various cancers was further assessed via Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Tumor-Immune System Interactions Database (TISIDB) and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource Database 2.0 (TIMER2.0) tools indicated that GJB5 affected the tumor's immune infiltration potential. This research also evaluated the association of GJB5 with immune features: immune modulatory genes, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI). The data indicated that enhanced GJB5 level was linked to worse DFI, OS, PFI, and DSS in some cancers. Additionally, GJB5 level was positively related to immune modulatory genes, TMB, immune cell infiltration, immunological checkpoints, and MSI in malignancies. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that GJB5 was upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. We also assessed GJB5 expression across various pancreatic cell lines. Notably, GJB5 was highly expressed in pancreatic cancer cells relative to normal pancreatic epithelial cells. Additionally, GJB5 knockdown in pancreatic cancer cells resulted in a significant reduction in cell proliferation.

Beyond its role in axonal guidance and angiogenesis, NRP1 is increasingly recognized for its significant impact on tumor progression and therapeutic outcomes. This review explores the diverse functions of NRP1 in cancer, encompassing its influence on tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis. NRP1 interacts with several key signaling pathways, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), semaphorins, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), modulating the tumor microenvironment and promoting angiogenesis. Moreover, NRP1 expression correlates with poor prognosis in various malignancies, underscoring its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Therapeutically, targeting NRP1 holds promise as a novel strategy to inhibit tumor growth and enhance the efficacy of regular treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Strategies involving NRP1-targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibodies, small molecule inhibitors, and gene silencing techniques, are being actively investigated in preclinical and clinical settings. Despite challenges in specificity and delivery, advances in understanding NRP1 biology offer new avenues for personalized cancer therapy. Although several types of cancer cells can express NRPs, the role of NRPs in tumor pathogenesis is largely unknown. Future investigations are needed to enhance our understanding of the effects and mechanisms of NRPs on the proliferation, apoptosis, and migration of neuronal, endothelial, and cancer cells. The novel frameworks or multi-omics approaches integrate data from multiple databases to better understand cancer's molecular and clinical features, develop personalized therapies, and help identify biomarkers.

          "abstract": "Glioma is a major cause of mortality among central nervous system tumors, with a generally poor prognosis. The lysyl oxidase (LOX) family, a group of copper-dependent amine oxidases, has been implicated in the progression of various cancers, but its specific role in glioma and its relationship with immune infiltration remains insufficiently explored. This study aims to investigate the LOX family's expression, prognostic significance, and immune infiltration dynamics in glioma to identify potential therapeutic targets. A comprehensive analysis was conducted using public databases to assess gene expression, mutation frequency, and immune infiltration patterns related to the LOX family in glioma. The results were validated through survival analysis and immunohistochemistry. Functional assays, including EdU, Transwell, and flow cytometry, were used to evaluate glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Co-culture experiments with immune cells, ELISA, and a glioma transplantation model were employed to study the immune-modulatory effects of the LOX family. Gene and protein expression levels were further analyzed using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The LOX family was significantly upregulated in low-grade gliomas and strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Although mutation frequencies were low, the LOX family contributed to glioma progression through pathways involving metastasis, hypoxia response, angiogenesis, and immune cell infiltration. LOX expression correlated with increased infiltration of macrophages and eosinophils and decreased presence of Treg and CD8+ T cells. Knockdown of LOX genes impaired glioma cell functions, induced apoptosis, and altered immune cell behavior by reducing M2 macrophage polarization and enhancing CD8+ T cell activity. The LOX family is overexpressed in glioma and is associated with poor prognosis and altered immune infiltration patterns. These findings highlight the LOX family as a promising prognostic marker and therapeutic target, particularly for enhancing the effectiveness of immunotherapy in glioma treatment.",

Of particular interest is the potential cancer-specific MX35 epitope of NaPi2b, as it serves as a target for monoclonal antibodies studied at various stages of preclinical and clinical trials. However, variations in the NaPi2b protein structure may limit the efficacy of therapeutic antibodies by affecting the accessibility of the MX35 epitope. <b>Methods:</b> An in silico analysis was performed using data from 101,562 tumor samples. Genomic DNA sequencing was conducted on blood samples from patients with ovarian carcinoma, breast cancer, and renal carcinoma to access the frequency of germline mutations in the <i>SLC34A2</i> gene region encoding the MX35 epitope. To assess the impact of the selected mutation, we generated a model cell line through site-directed mutagenesis carrying the mutant NaPi2b variant. <b>Results:</b> Using in silico analysis, we identified 17 unique variants in the <i>SLC34A2</i> gene leading to amino acid substitutions within the MX35 epitope of the NaPi2b. Among these, the most prevalent mutation, c.989C>T, resulting in p.T330M substitution, was detected in 5 out of 64 patients through genomic DNA sequencing. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we created the OVCAR-8/NaPi2b<sup>p.T330M</sup> model cell line. L3 (28/1) monoclonal antibodies specific to the MX35 epitope failed to recognize the mutant NaPi2b<sup>p.T330M</sup> variant compared to the wild-type of the NaPi2b in both Western blot and confocal microscopy experiments. <b>Conclusions:</b> The obtained data may serve as a basis for predicting the efficacy of monoclonal antibody-based targeted therapy binding to the MX35 epitope of NaPi2b in the treatment of oncological diseases.",

          "abstract": "Mutations in genome maintenance factors drive sporadic and hereditary breast cancers. Here, we searched for potential drivers based on germline DNA analysis from a cohort consisting of patients with early-onset breast cancer negative for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. This revealed candidate genes that subsequently were subjected to RNA interference-based (RNAi-based) phenotype screens to reveal genome integrity effects. We identified several genes with functional roles in genome maintenance, including Glucose-6-Phosphatase Catalytic Subunit 3 (G6PC3), SMC4, and CCDC108. Notably, G6PC3-deficient cells exhibited increased levels of \u03b3H2AX and micronuclei formation, along with defects in homologous recombination (HR) repair. Consistent with these observations, G6PC3 was required for the efficient recruitment of BRCA1 to sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). RNA-Seq analysis revealed that G6PC3 promotes the expression of multiple homologous recombination repair genes, including BRCA1. Through CRISPR-Select functional-genetic phenotype analysis of G6PC3 germline mutations, we identified 2 germline G6PC3 variants displaying partial loss of function. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that G6pc3 deficiency accelerates mammary tumor formation induced by Trp53 loss in mice. In conclusion, our cohort-based functional analysis has unveiled genome maintenance factors and identified G6PC3 as a potential candidate tumor suppressor in breast cancer.",

          "abstract": "Cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been a cornerstone of therapy for advanced/metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC). However, no genomic characteristics have been validated as prognostic biomarkers for this therapy. We sought to identify prognostic biomarkers using plasma cell-free (cf)DNA collected in a phase 3 cooperative group trial. We analyzed pretreatment cfDNA from a cohort nested in CALGB 90601 (Alliance), a first-line trial of gemcitabine/cisplatin with bevacizumab or placebo in mUC. We examined associations between cfDNA features and overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and treatment response. Baseline cfDNA was sequenced from 201 patients with mUC. There was no statistically significant association between alterations in DNA damage response (DDR) genes and response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy (12/24; 50% response rate in DDR+ vs 60/145; 41% response rate in DDR-; <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.4), OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-1.22; <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.3) or PFS (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.48-1.22; <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.3), although the DDR analysis was underpowered owing to the low frequency of DDR gene alterations. Higher variant allele frequency (VAF) in circulating tumor (ct)DNA was associated with shorter OS (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.26-5.00; <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.009) and PFS (HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.02-4.67; <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.045). Shorter OS was associated with cfDNA alterations in <i>TERT</i> (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.15-2.19; <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.005), <i>PIK3CA</i> (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.20-3.04; <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.006), and <i>ERBB2</i> (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.08-2.49; <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.019). Among patients with mUC treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, high pretreatment VAF in ctDNA and alterations in the <i>TERT</i> promoter, <i>PIK3CA</i>, and <i>ERBB2</i> were associated with poor prognosis. We looked at the link between tumor DNA present in blood and outcomes after chemotherapy for patients with advanced bladder cancer. Higher amounts of tumor DNA in blood and mutations in specific cancer genes were linked to worse survival. The results may help in the design of new studies to improve survival for patients with advanced bladder cancer.This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00942331.",

However, there is no systematic assessment of the role of TRIP13 in the immunotherapy response across human cancers. Therefore, a pan-cancer analysis involving expression, prognosis, immune-related mechanisms, and biomarker values was performed to explore the associations between TRIP13 expression and the immunotherapy response. TRIP13 is highly expressed in various types of cancer, increasing patient outcomes in eight types of cancer. TRIP13 expression was correlated with significant tumor mutation burden and microsatellite instability, and its mutations were linked with poor prognosis in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma. TRIP13 promoted endothelial cell and hematopoietic stem cell infiltration in human cancers. Additionally, TRIP13 mutation significantly increased the infiltration of CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, which might contribute to poor prognosis. Furthermore, three key genes that interact with TRIP13 were identified: CDC20, RAD1, and MAD2L1, which are related to the cell cycle and ultimately promote tumorigenesis and proliferation. The expression of TRIP13 was significantly greater in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells than in corresponding normal cells according to qPCR. Taken together, these findings indicate that TRIP13 is associated with poor prognosis in eight human cancers and serves as a novel biomarker for predicting immunotherapy efficacy. Our first pan-cancer study contributes to personalized precision medicine in cancer immunotherapy, promoting subsequent clinical management and improving patient prognosis.",

Prolyl 4-hydroxylase, alpha polypeptide I (P4HA1), a key enzyme in collagen synthesis, comprises two identical alpha subunits and two beta subunits. Studies on the expression and impact of P4HA1 in GC\u00a0cells are limited. The expression and prognosis of P4HA1 in GC were analyzed using bioinformatics. To confirm the P4HA1 level in GC tissues and cells, Western blot (WB) and RT-qPCR experiments were conducted. The signaling pathways related to P4HA1 in GC were examined using the DAVID database. Moreover, the expression of P4HA1 was downregulated by transfecting GC cell lines (HGC-27 and SGC-7901) with siRNA technology. Furthermore, GC proliferation, migration, and invasion were detected via plate cloning, CCK-8, and Transwell assays. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin) and the stemness marker CD44 protein expression in GC cells were detected using WB. The sphere-forming ability of GC cells was analyzed using a sphere-forming assay to determine the effect of P4HA1. Bioinformatics and experimental analyses demonstrated that P4HA1 expression was extensively detected in GC tissues and cells, and strongly related to a poor prognosis for GC. In vitro studies demonstrated that P4HA1 suppression hindered the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells and suppressed EMT characteristics. Both sphere-forming and WB assays revealed that the sphere-forming potential of GC cells and the level of CD44 protein decreased after knocking down the expression of P4HA1, indicating that suppression of P4HA1 could inhibit the stemness of GC cells. The study concluded that P4HA1 has the potential to be expressed substantially in GC tissues and\u00a0cells and is capable of enhancing the proliferation, metastasis, and stemness of GC.",

Oncolytic virotherapy represents a promising option for bladder cancer and received in 2024 FDA therapy designation for the treatment of non-invasive high-grade bladder cancer (BLCA). For muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), preclinical studies demonstrated high efficacy of the oncolytic adenovirus XVir-N-31 in urothelial carcinoma (UC). We analyzed the potency of XVir-N-31 virotherapy as a novel treatment option in SCC. Replication of XVir-N-31 has been described to be facilitated by high expression level of Y-Box binding protein 1 (YB-1). Increased YB-1-mRNA expression was detected in basal/squamous subtype in TCGA BLCA cohort compared to urothelial and luminal BLCA and correlated with patient outcomes. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of 89 SCC on a tissue microarray confirmed strong YB-1 expression in squamous BLCA (sq-BLCA). In vitro, XVir-N-31 showed in subtype-specific cell cultures high rates of infection, replication and cell-killing capacity. In a novel in ovo xenograft model, XVir-N-31 impaired growth of xenografts of patient-derived ex vivo cell lines (p-SCC, p-UC) with growth suppression rates of 39-49%.

This study evaluates the diagnostic and clinical relevance of CDCA genes in breast cancer. Breast cancer and normal breast cell lines were cultured and analyzed for CDCA gene expression using RT-qPCR and further validated using public databases. Functional assays, including cell proliferation, colony formation, and wound healing, were performed following siRNA-mediated knockdown of CDCA2 and CDCA3. Mutational, CNV, methylation, and survival analyses, along with miRNA regulation and PPI network construction, were conducted to explore the role of CDCA genes in breast cancer progression. Our findings revealed significant upregulation of CDCA genes in breast cancer cell lines compared to normal controls, with all these genes exhibiting the highest diagnostic potential based on AUC values in ROC analysis. Pathological stage analysis indicated that CDCA5 and CDCA7 expression significantly varied across different breast cancer stages. Mutational analysis showed that CDCA2 had the highest mutation rate, with missense mutations being the most common. CNV analysis revealed amplification events in several CDCA genes, particularly CDCA2, CDCA3, CDCA4, and CDCA7. Promoter methylation analysis revealed significant hypomethylation in the CDCA genes in breast cancer, which correlated negatively with their expression. Survival analysis demonstrated that high expression of CDCA2, CDCA3, CDCA4, CDCA5, CDCA7, and CDCA8 was associated with worse overall survival, highlighting their prognostic significance. Furthermore, immune infiltration analysis revealed significant correlations between CDCA gene expression and immune cell types, suggesting a role in immune modulation. miRNA analysis identified specific miRNAs targeting CDCA genes, with several showing potential as diagnostic biomarkers. Lastly, the knockdown of CDCA2 and CDCA3 in breast cancer cells significantly reduced cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration, indicating their critical roles in tumor growth and metastasis. This study highlights CDCA genes as promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in breast cancer. Their upregulation correlates with poor survival, and the knockdown of CDCA2 and CDCA3 impairs tumor growth, emphasizing their potential as therapeutic targets. These findings suggest that CDCA genes could be integrated into clinical practice for improved breast cancer management. Not applicable.",

The development of predictive biomarkers and therapeutic approaches is an area of unmet need. p73, a member of the p53 family of transcription factors, has essential functions during DNA repair, proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis. The role of p73 in ovarian cancer pathogenesis and response to therapy is largely unknown. The clinicopathological significance of p73 protein expression was evaluated in 278 human ovarian cancers. <i>TP73</i> transcripts were investigated in publicly available clinical data sets (n = 522) and bioinformatics analysis was completed in the ovarian TCGA cohort (n = 182). Preclinically, p73 was overexpressed in A2780 platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer cells or depleted in platinum-resistant A2780cis cells and investigated for aggressive phenotypes, as well as platinum sensitivity. High p73 protein expression was linked with high grade (<i>p</i> < 0.001), advanced-stage disease (<i>p</i> = 0.002), and shorter progression-free survival (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). <i>TP73</i> transcripts were significantly higher in tumours compared to normal tissue (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) and linked with shorter PFS (<i>p</i> = 0.047). Preclinically, p73 overexpression in A2780 cells increased proliferation, invasion, spheroid formation, and DNA repair capacity, and was associated with the upregulation of multiple DNA repair and platinum resistance-associated genes. In contrast, p73 deletion in A2780cis led to reduced proliferation and enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin, along with DNA double-strand break accumulation, G2/M cell cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis. We conclude that p73 is a predictor of platinum resistance. p73 can be exploited for targeted ovarian cancer therapy.",

To investigate this, we retrospectively analyzed 283 adults treated with commercial CD19 CAR-T therapy, assessing 958 PET-CT scans across four time points: pre-apheresis, pre-lymphodepletion, best response, and relapse. EN involvement prior to CAR-T therapy was common (76%). Outcomes for patients with exclusive EN disease were similar to those with nodal (ND) disease alone; however, patients with concomitant EN and ND disease (EN\u2009+\u2009ND) had lower complete response rates and shorter progression-free survival. Site-specific outcomes varied: lungs/pleura/pericardium and gastrointestinal/peritoneum involvement had the lowest local response rates (48% and 51%, respectively).

Resistance to BRCA treatment may be counteracted by the induction of ferroptosis in combination with immunotherapy. The study aims develop iron death-related prognostic models to predict prognosis and immunotherapy effects in BRCA patients. We collected and organized 22 ferroptosis-related pathways and quantified their pathway activities using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a pathway associated with prognosis in patients with BRCA. We compared the differences between patients with different CoQ10 expressions in terms of prognosis, biological function, mutational profile, immune infiltration, immunotherapy, and chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity. Patients with high CoQ pathway activity had a worse prognosis. In addition, patients with high CoQ activity showed greater cell cycle activation and lower immune infiltration. Based on different CoQ10 expression patterns, we developed a CoQ10-related prognostic model. The accuracy and stability of CoQ10-related prognostic models were well validated in the training set and multiple validation sets. High-risk patients showed a propensity for immune depletion and tolerance to immunotherapy. There were also some differences in the sensitivity to different chemotherapeutic agents between high- and low-risk patients. We have constructed and validated a CoQ10-related gene model that can predict the prognosis of BRCA. Critically, it may serve as a reference standard to guide outcome prognostication in patients with BRCA.",

Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) provides unprecedented access to various types of molecular data, ranging from typical DNA mutations and RNA expressions to more deeply analyzed or whole-genomic features, such as HLA haplotypes and structural variations. We analyzed the PCAWG data of 13 cancer types from 1,514 patients to identify prognosis markers belonging to 17 molecular features in the survival analysis based on the Cox and Lasso regression methods. We found that germline features including HLA haplotypes, neoantigens, and the number of structural variations were associated with overall survival; however, mutational signatures were not. Measuring a few markers provided a sufficient prognostic performance evaluated by c-index for each cancer type. DNA markers demonstrated better or comparable prognostic performance compared to RNA markers in some cancer types. \"Universal\" markers strongly associated with overall survival across cancer types were not identified.

          "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common form of cancer globally, and arises from the hyperproliferation of epithelial cells in the intestine. The architecture and maintenance of these cells is governed by two major signalling pathways working in a counter-gradient: the stem cell WNT signalling pathway, and the prodifferentiation bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway. It has long been known that this WNT-BMP balance is disrupted in CRC, with hyperactive WNT signalling leading to increased proliferation of epithelial cells and tumour progression. BMP signalling, and its prodifferentiation effects, have increasingly become a focus for CRC research. Loss of BMP signalling, and that of its receptors, has been shown to increase WNT signalling and cancer stem cells in CRC. BMP signalling is further modulated through secreted BMP antagonists localised to the intestinal crypts, which create a niche ensuring that sustained WNT signalling can maintain stem-cell self-renewal capacity. A number of studies combine to demonstrate the effects of overexpression of these BMP antagonists, showing that hyperactivity of the stem-cell-supporting WNT signalling pathway ensues, leading to deregulation of the intestinal epithelium. Cellular hyperproliferation, the emergence of ectopic crypts, and an increase in stem cell numbers and characteristics are common themes, contributing to disrupted epithelial homeostasis, an increase in CRC risk and progression, and resistance to therapy. This review aims to compile the current knowledge on BMP antagonists, their role in CRC development, and how we can utilise this information for biomarker research and novel therapeutics. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

However, its contribution to kidney function decline and the underlying molecular mechanism(s) remains unclear. Here, we show that kidney-specific deletion of Fbxw7, the recognition receptor of the SCF<sup>FBW7</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase, results in a juvenile-adult NPHP-like pathology characterized by slow-progressing corticomedullary cysts, tubular degeneration, severe fibrosis, and gradual loss of kidney function. Expression levels of SOX9, a known substrate of FBW7, and WNT4, a potent pro-fibrotic factor and downstream effector of SOX9, were elevated upon loss of FBW7. Heterozygous deletion of Sox9 in compound mutant mice led to the normalization of WNT4 levels, reduced fibrosis, and preservation of kidney function without significant effects on cystic dilatation and tubular degeneration. These data suggest that FBW7-SOX9-WNT4-induced fibrosis drives kidney function decline in NPHP and, possibly, other forms of autosomal recessive kidney disorders.",

Since it is not possible to directly target a TSG, no treatment options are available for these patients. Here, we identify <i>SRP19</i> and the protein secretion machinery as a unique vulnerability in cancers with heterozygous <i>APC</i> loss. <i>SRP19</i> is located 15 kb from <i>APC</i> and is almost always codeleted in these tumors. Heterozygous <i>APC/SRP19</i> loss leads to lower levels of <i>SRP19</i> mRNA and protein. Consequently, cells with <i>APC/SRP19</i> loss are vulnerable to partial suppression of <i>SRP19</i>. Moreover, we show that <i>SRP19</i> is rate limiting for the formation of the Signal Recognition Particle, a complex that mediates ER-protein translocation, and thus, heterozygous <i>SRP19</i> loss leads to less protein secretion and higher levels of ER-stress. As a result, low-dose arsenic trioxide induces ER-stress and inhibits proliferation in cultured cell lines and animal models.

Although gains and losses of chromosomal position have been reported, the association between copy number alteration and lung cancer patient survival has not been extensively investigated. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of public cBioPortal datasets spanning 25 lung cancer studies to identify putative cancer driver genes with copy number alterations associated with overall patient survival. Ten copy-number altered genes enriched in deceased lung cancer patients were identified. Seven of these putative driver genes were located in the 7p11.2 chromosomal location, and two were in the 9p21.3 cytoband. Among these genes, the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S17 (MRPS17) amplification was significantly associated with a lower patient survival rate (<i>P</i> = 1.47e-7). To investigate the functional role of MRPS17, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown was performed in two non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, A549 and NCI-H460. MRPS17 knockdown significantly reduced cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth in both cell lines. Furthermore, knockdown of MRPS17 decreased the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathway, suggesting its role in driving lung cancer progression through this critical oncogenic pathway. Our findings highlight MRPS17 as a potential cancer therapy target and a prognostic biomarker that may improve the survival rates of lung cancer patients. Future studies should explore its inhibition as a therapeutic strategy as well as elucidate its molecular mechanisms in cancer progression.",

FTase attaches farnesyl to the K-Ras C-terminal CVIM tetrapeptide, enabling membrane binding. However, K-Ras can also undergo compensatory geranylgeranylation by geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I), making FTase inhibition alone ineffective. Dual inhibition of FTase and GGTase I is necessary to fully block K-Ras localization and its cancer activity. We developed bivalent inhibitors targeting both FTase and GGTase I by binding to the CVIM (C = cysteine, V = valine, I = isoleucine, M = methionine) site and an adjacent acidic surface. A nonthiol CVIM peptidomimetic based on a piperidine scaffold showed potent FTase inhibition (K<sub>i</sub> = 2.1\u00a0nM) with less effect on GGTase I (K<sub>i</sub> = 210\u00a0nM). Adding cationic modules to this compound produced dual inhibitors with enhanced potency (K<sub>i</sub> = 2-5\u00a0nM), significantly improving upon previous agents. These bivalent inhibitors effectively reduced mutant K-Ras cancer cell viability and inhibited K-Ras farnesylation and geranylgeranylation in cells. This dual-targeting approach shows promise for treating K-Ras-driven cancers.",

Herein, using genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening and multiple functional studies, this work identifies COP9 signalosome subunit 5 (COPS5) as a driver of sorafenib resistance and a suppressor of ferroptosis in HCC. Consistently, the amplification and overexpression of COPS5 are frequently observed in clinical HCC samples, which are associated with poor patient prognosis and might predict patient response to sorafenib therapy. Mechanistically, COPS5 stabilized mitogen-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) through deubiquitination and, in turn, induced the activation of heat shock protein beta-1 (HSPB1), a ferroptosis repressor, thereby protecting HCC cells from ferroptosis and consequently leading to sorafenib resistance and tumor progression, while its own expression could be induced by sorafenib treatment via activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-activated transcription. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of COPS5/MK2 synergize with sorafenib to induce ferroptosis and suppress HCC progression. This data reveals the crucial role of COPS5 in triggering ferroptosis defense and sorafenib resistance through the activation of the MK2-HSPB1 axis in HCC and highlights the potential of targeting COPS5/MK2 combined with sorafenib as a promising strategy for treating HCC.",

These analyses identified <i>KRAS</i> as a key target modulated by U2AF1<sup>S34F</sup>.

Finally, the oncogenic effect of EFNA5 was verified in vivo and in vitro. The expression levels of EFNA1-5 were significantly upregulated in PAAD. The expression of EFNA1/3/4/5 were significantly associated with overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) in PAAD patients. The high expression of EFNA2-5 were related to poor clinical features, such as higher tumor stage or grade and a wider range of lymph node metastasis. EFNA1-5 were closely associated with immune cell infiltration, CAFs, and MDSCs expression. Furthermore, EFNA5 is an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in PAAD patients, and it can promote the malignant progression of pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo.

In a Japanese cohort, we compared the clinical backgrounds and prognoses of molecular glioblastoma (mGBM) and conventional glioblastoma (histological glioblastoma, hGBM). We included 270 patients with glioblastoma treated at five institutions during 2011-2023. Driver gene analysis was performed using a brain tumor-specific custom gene panel to verify the association between molecular and clinical information. Patients with mGBM had better preoperative KPS, lower Ki-67, and lower removal rates than did those with hGBM. Overall survival was longer in patients with mGBM than in those with hGBM (1207 vs 599\u00a0days, p\u2009=\u20090.037). TP53 mutation (hazard ratio: 5.33, 95% confidence interval: 0.26-108.7, p\u2009=\u20090.012) and histological grade 3 (p\u2009=\u20090.051) were poor prognostic factors for mGBM. Patients with mGBM had better preoperative KPS, worse removal rates, lower Ki-67 labeling index, and better overall survival than did those with hGBM. In addition, the histological grade of mGBM is potentially useful for estimating prognosis. In the WHO CNS5 2021, glioblastoma patients remain a heterogeneous population, and prognostic stratification based on the patient's clinical background and molecular information is desirable.",

These genes are known for their involvement in various cancer-related processes, but their precise contributions to breast cancer remain unclear. We employed an integrative analysis combining transcriptomics, proteomics, DNA methylation profiling, immune infiltration analysis, and single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the expression patterns, regulatory mechanisms, and functional impacts of CCNB1, PLK1, and HPSE in breast cancer. Functional assays using si-RNA knockdown of CCNB1 and PLK1 were performed to assess their roles in cell proliferation. CCNB1, PLK1, and HPSE are upregulated in breast tumors at the mRNA and protein levels. CCNB1 and PLK1 promote tumor growth and metastasis, while HPSE is linked to immune pathways. DNA methylation in BRCA correlates with prognosis, with PLK1 alterations protective for recurrence-free survival. High expression of these genes worsens prognosis, with CCNB1 as a risk factor for overall survival. Immune infiltration analysis associates these genes with tumor-infiltrating immune cells, highlighting HPSE's immunotherapeutic potential. Single-cell RNA sequencing confirms CCNB1 and PLK1 drive malignant proliferation and an immunosuppressive environment. Functional assays demonstrated that silencing CCNB1 and PLK1 significantly reduced breast cancer cell proliferation, indicating regulatory interactions among PLK1, CCNB1, and MKI67. This study provides evidence that CCNB1, PLK1, and HPSE are key players in breast cancer progression and potential biomarkers for prognosis. Furthermore, their roles in immune regulation suggest they could be promising targets for immunotherapy.",

However, its precise function in oncogenesis and immune infiltration remains incompletely understood. To investigate this, we utilized multiple databases to assess the mRNA and protein expression levels of CLEC12A across normal tissues and a broad spectrum of cancers. We also evaluated its prognostic and diagnostic significance in pan-cancer contexts. Furthermore, the relationship between CLEC12A expression and immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoints, and immune predictors was explored. In addition, Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and differential expression analysis were performed to examine the biological relevance of CLEC12A in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We also leveraged various databases to predict CLEC12A's response to immunotherapy and drug sensitivity. Finally, in vitro experiments validated the functional role of CLEC12A in LUAD. Our comprehensive pan-cancer analysis revealed that CLEC12A exhibited distinct expression patterns across different cancer types, suggesting its potential as both a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. Notably, CLEC12A expression was strongly correlated with immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoints, and immune predictors. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted that increased CLEC12A expression in LUAD was associated with a variety of immune-related biological processes and pathways. Moreover, CLEC12A showed significant predictive value for immunotherapy outcomes, and several drugs targeting CLEC12A were identified. In vitro experiments further demonstrated that CLEC12A overexpression inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of LUAD cells. Taken together, our findings position CLEC12A as a promising candidate for cancer detection, prognosis, and as a therapeutic target, particularly in LUAD, where it may serve as a potential target for both immunotherapy and targeted therapy.",

The prevalence of the MSI-H/dMMR phenotype is highest in endometrial and colorectal cancers, and this phenotype is associated with a distinct tumour biology, prognosis and responsiveness to various anticancer treatments. In a minority of patients, MSI-H/dMMR cancers result from an inherited pathogenic variant in the context of Lynch syndrome, which has important implications for familial genetic screening. Whether these hereditary cancers have a different biology and clinical behaviour to their sporadic counterparts remains uncertain. Interest in this tumour molecular subtype has increased following the discovery of the high sensitivity of metastatic MSI-H/dMMR cancers to immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in a histology-agnostic manner, which reflects the genomic hypermutation resulting from dMMR that renders these tumours highly immunogenic and immune infiltrated. This vulnerability is now also being exploited in early stage disease settings. Despite this common biological foundation, different MSI-H/dMMR cancers have histotype-specific features that correspond to their particular cell or tissue of origin, which might be associated with differences in prognosis and sensitivity to ICIs. In this Review, we provide an overview of the epidemiology, biology, pathogenesis, clinical diagnosis and treatment of MSI-H/dMMR tumours as a histology-agnostic cancer phenomenon. We also highlight peculiarities associated with specific pathogenetic alterations and histologies of MSI-H/dMMR tumours.",

Despite extensive investigation, the precise pathophysiology remains elusive.This article explores new autophagy-related DEG genes between EM and EAOC, and investigates CXCL12's expression and prognostic relevance across pan-cancer. From Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), we retrieved gene sequencing data to uncover DEGs. We carried out enrichment analysis, PPI network construction and explored CXCL12's multi-database expression and prognostic significance employing the analytical tools of ONCOMINE, PrognoScan, GEPIA, and Kaplan-Meier Plotter. Subsequently, assessing the relationship between CXCL12 expression and immune presence in cancer utilizing GEPIA and TIMER. Lastly, CXCL12, IL17, STAT3, and FOXP3 protein expressions were determined through immunohistochemistry analysis in EAOC, EM, and normal endometrial tissues. Two DEGs were discovered and enrichment analysis indicated virus-cytokine/receptor interactions, chemokine signaling, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interplay as pivotal in EAOC. Notably, cancerous tissues exhibited reduced CXCL12 levels compared with non-malignant tissues across cancers. CXCL12, IL17, STAT3, Th17/Treg ratio, and FOXP3 expressions were also lower in EAOC than EM and normal tissues. Additionally, CXCL12 expression was related to stage, survival, immune subtype, and molecular classification across cancers. In conclusion, our study implicates CXCL12 and altered Th17/Treg balance in progression from EM to EAOC.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which includes adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), accounts for the majority of these deaths. Due to the lack of early clinical symptoms and late-stage diagnosis, there is an urgent need for precise and targeted therapeutic strategies. Cyclin-dependent kinase regulatory subunit 1B (<i>CKS1B</i>), a key regulator of the cell cycle, has been implicated in various human cancers. Emerging evidence suggests that its upregulation is associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for early detection and targeted therapy. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis to evaluate the role of <i>CKS1B</i> in LUAD and LUSC. Differential gene expression analysis, survival analysis, immune infiltration correlation, and pathway enrichment analysis were performed using publicly available transcriptomic datasets. Additionally, gene interaction networks were analyzed to assess the functional significance of <i>CKS1B</i> in lung cancer progression. Our findings indicate a significant overexpression of <i>CKS1B</i> in LUAD and LUSC compared to normal lung tissues. Survival analysis demonstrated that higher <i>CKS1B</i> expression correlates with poor prognosis in NSCLC patients. Immune infiltration analysis revealed a potential role of <i>CKS1B</i> in modulating the tumor microenvironment, further supporting its relevance in lung cancer progression. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted its involvement in critical oncogenic pathways, including cell cycle regulation and immune modulation. The results suggest that <i>CKS1B</i> serves as a potential biomarker for early detection and prognosis in NSCLC. Its association with immune response pathways underscores its possible role in immunotherapy.

While the structure of WNT ligands has been elucidated, little is known about how mutations in these proteins affect colorectal cancer. Here, we show that mutations in WNT ligands found in colorectal cancer show regional specificity and selectivity for particular conserved sequences. We further show that mutations in colorectal cancer are not selecting for changes in the binding affinity of the ligands to their receptor. We use clinical data to identify mutations to WNT5A as under selection and correlating with patient outcomes in colorectal cancer, and by combining mutational data and folding energy calculations, elastic network modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that these mutations alter its structural dynamics and flexibility. Thus, we predict a novel structure-function relationship for mutations in WNT ligands in human cancers.",

TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusions were observed more frequently in tumors from European American compared to African American patients (41% vs. 11%, P\u2009=\u20090.015). Asian patients (N\u2009=\u20099) and other racial groups comprised a small minority of our cohort. No differences in overall survival were noted across racial groups. Despite demonstrating similar clinical outcomes, cancers from African Americans display distinct tumor biology. Specifically, we observed racial differences in expression of prostate cancer driver gene pathways (including potential clinically actionable pathways of IFN-\u03b3 and JAK/STAT) and DNA alterations, including TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion. Our findings highlight the importance of racial diversity in future genomic profiling and clinical trials efforts.",

MHC molecule expression facilitates T cell recognition and activation to permit the eradication of metastatic tumor cells. We identified nuclear corepressor 2 (NCOR2) as a key epigenetic regulator of MHC class I molecule expression on breast tumor cells. Patients with triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) that expressed high levels of NCOR2 also exhibited reduced metastasis free survival and decreased MHC class I expression, and the metastatic lesions in patients with TNBC had high nuclear NCOR2 and reduced CD8 T cell levels and activity. Genetically and experimentally reducing NCOR2 expression in tumor cells permitted interferon gamma upregulation of MHC class I, and potentiated CD8 T cell activity and induction of apoptosis to repress metastatic progression of disseminated breast cancer cells. These studies provide evidence to support NCOR2 as a targetable epigenetic regulator of metastasis towards which therapies could be developed to reduce patient mortality.",

We aim to develop a DRP model toward the repurposing of chemotherapy, requiring only information from clinical-grade NGS (cNGS) panels of restricted gene sets. Data sparsity and limited patient drug response information make this challenging. We firstly show that existing DRPs perform equally with whole-exome versus cNGS (\u223c300 genes) data. Drug IDentifier (DruID) is then described, a DRP model for restricted gene sets using transfer learning, variant annotations, domain-invariant representation learning, and multi-task learning.

The aim of this study was to understand the prognostic and immunological significance of nicotinamide metabolism-related genes in pan-cancer. We downloaded The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype Tissue Expression pan-cancer datasets for NMNAT1 from the UCSC database. We analyzed the differential expression, prognosis, genetic alterations, DNA methylation, immune infiltration, and co-expression with RNA modification-related genes and immune checkpoint-related genes. Genes with expression patterns similar to NMNAT1 were identified using the GEPIA library. The GSCA database was used to investigate the correlation between gene expression and drug sensitivity, as assessed by GDSC and CTRP. The CancerSEA database was employed to examine the association of NMNAT1 expression at the single-cell level across different tumors and its relation to 14 functional states. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess the clinical significance of NMNAT1 expression. NMNAT1 exhibited differential expression across 25 tumor types, including colorectal cancer (CRC), and its expression was significantly associated with the prognosis of 11 tumors. Furthermore, NMNAT1 expression correlated significantly with clinicopathological features. NMNAT1 was strongly associated with immune cells, RNA modification-related genes, and immune checkpoint-related genes in most tumors, affecting immune responses. The expression of NMNAT1 also correlated with sensitivity and resistance to several drugs. Single-cell analysis revealed that NMNAT1 is involved in the progression of retinoblastoma, uveal melanoma, and CRC. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that NMNAT1 expression is an independent prognostic factor in patients with CRC. NMNAT1 is a crucial prognostic and immune marker gene for nicotinamide metabolism, particularly in CRC. It has potential as a clinical biomarker and a therapeutic target for cancer treatment.",

ATRA suppresses \u03b2-catenin activity in patients and leukemic mice. Consequently, it inhibits the growth and survival of MDS/AML cells from patients with active \u03b2-catenin-JAG1 signaling and promotes their differentiation. This occurs independently of cytogenetics and mutational profile. ATRA also improves disease outcome in mice with no evidence of relapse and a superior safety profile to SOC. A human anti-JAG1 antibody improves efficacy in leukemic mice and patient-derived MDS/AML cells. \u03b2-catenin activation provides an explanation for the differential response to ATRA and a mechanistic biomarker for ATRA repurposing in myeloid malignancies, potentially evading relapse and extending across a broad range of cancers.",

This study aimed to determine the prognostic or predictive impact of both subtyping marker panels in two large cohorts of advanced and resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients.

Transcriptional subtypes widely overlapped in both marker panels (\u03c7<sup>2</sup><i>p</i> < 0.001) but switched during disease progression in up to 31.6% of patients. They had a modest impact on the patients' prognosis in both cohorts, with longer overall survival (OS) for patients with KRT81-/HNF1A+ or GATA6+ tumors but better progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with KRT81+/GATA6- tumors treated with palliative or adjuvant gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.

We previously reported the increased activated form of 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (phospho-p70S6K1) in a triple-negative BC (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-231 exposed to glycated albumin (GA) and in invasive ductal carcinoma tissues from T2DM patients, compared to untreated cells and their non-diabetic counterparts, respectively. <b>Objective:</b> We aimed to explore the function of p70S6K1 in GA-promoted TNBC progression. <b>Methods:</b> By employing small interference (si)RNA technology or blocking its kinase activity using its specific pharmacological inhibitor, we monitored cell invasion using Transwell<sup>\u00ae</sup> inserts and the expression levels of activated signaling proteins and cancer-related proteins using Western blot. <b>Results:</b> In silico analysis revealed that high mRNA levels of p70S6K1 were associated with an unfavorable prognosis and progression to advanced stages of TNBC in DM patients. The downregulation/blockade of p70S6K1 inhibited GA-promoted MDA-MB-231 cell invasion and the phosphorylation of protein S6 and ERK1/2, the p70S6K1 downstream effector, and the key oncogenic signaling protein, respectively. The suppression of the expression of GA-upregulated cancer proteins, including enolase-2, capping protein CapG, galectin-3, and cathepsin D, was observed after p70S6K1 downregulation/blockade. Further in silico validation analyses revealed increased gene expression of galectin-3 in DM TNBC patients, resulting in poor overall survival and disease-free survival. <b>Conclusions:</b> Targeting p70S6K1 may present a valuable therapeutic strategy, while galectin-3 could serve as a potential prognostic biomarker for invasive BC progression in DM patients.",

Prior research supports the use of IHC for the detection of p53 overexpression to predict the presence of <i>TP53</i> alterations known to be associated with adverse outcomes. However, to reach a consensus definition of p53 overexpression in PCa, further insights are needed. This study aimed to compare two fundamental approaches of evaluating p53 expression across a variety of specimens regarding PCa progression. This study included 84 patients (75% self-identified as African American) diagnosed with PCa between 1996 and 2021 at the DC VA Medical Center. Representative sections of core biopsies, radical prostatectomies, transurethral prostate resections, and metastatic deposits were examined. p53 nuclear expression was scored according to the highest intensity observed (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) and the percentage (0%, <1%, 1-5%, >5%) of tumor cells expressing any level of intensity in the aggregate tumor area. All slides were reviewed by two independent pathologists. Pertinent clinical data were collected. A total of 34 patients (40%) exhibited p53 nuclear expression, of which 18 (21%) showed the maximum (3+) intensity. The presence of maximum intensity, regardless of percentage, was found to be associated with Grade Group (<i>p</i> < 0.001), higher PSA at biopsy (<i>p</i> < 0.001), BCR (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and metastasis (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Importantly, maximum p53 intensity was identified only in patients who developed metastatic disease.

Extensive research has highlighted the significance of Galectins in the context of cancer, aiding in the identification of biomarkers for early detection, personalized therapy, and predicting treatment responses. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the structural characteristics, ligand-binding properties, and interacting proteins of Galectins. We delve into their biological functions and examine their roles across various cancer types. Galectins, characterized by a conserved carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), are divided into prototype, tandem-repeat, and chimera types based on their structural configurations. Prototype Galectins contain a single CRD, tandem-repeat Galectins contain two distinct CRDs linked by a peptide, and the chimera-type Galectin-3 features a unique structural arrangement. The capacity of Galectins to engage in multivalent interactions allows them to regulate a variety of signaling pathways, thereby affecting cell fate and function. In cancer, Galectins contribute to tumor cell transformation, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis, making them critical targets for therapeutic intervention. This review discusses the multifaceted roles of Galectins in cancer progression and explores current advancements in the development of Galectin-targeted therapies. We also address the challenges and future directions for integrating Galectin research into clinical practice to enhance cancer treatment outcomes. In brief, understanding the complex functions of Galectins in cancer biology opens new avenues for therapeutic strategies. Continued research on Galectin interactions and their pathological roles is essential for developing effective carbohydrate-based treatments and improving clinical interventions for cancer patients.",

Despite advances in treatment, the molecular mechanisms driving DLBC progression remain incompletely understood, necessitating the identification of novel biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. In this study, we analyzed two publicly available datasets (GSE32018 and GSE56315) from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO) to identify overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Later on, a comprehensive in silico and in vitro methodology was adopted to decipher the role of identify DEGs in DLBC. DEGs analysis of GSE32018 and GSE56315 datasets identified five overlapping gene: SP3, CSNK1A1, STYX, SIRT5, and MGEA5. Expression validation using the GEPIA2 database confirmed the upregulation of SP3, CSNK1A1, STYX, and SIRT5, and the downregulation of MGEA5 in DLBC tissues compared to normal controls. Furthermore, mutational analysis revealed that CSNK1A1 was the only gene among these DEGs to exhibit mutations, with a 2.7% mutation frequency in DLBC patients. Methylation analysis highlighted a negative correlation between DEGs methylation levels and mRNA expression, while survival analysis identified high STYX expression as significantly associated with poorer overall survival in DLBC patients. Functional assays demonstrated that STYX knockdown in U2932 cells led to reduced cell proliferation, colony formation, and enhanced wound healing, indicating STYX's pivotal role in DLBC cell survival and migration. Additionally, gene enrichment analysis revealed the involvement of these DEGs in key biological processes, including intracellular trafficking and myeloid progenitor cell differentiation. These findings emphasize the potential of SP3, CSNK1A1, STYX, SIRT5, and MGEA5 as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in DLBC, particularly highlighting STYX as a promising prognostic marker and potential target for therapeutic intervention.",

          "abstract": "Aging is a known risk factor for melanoma, yet mechanisms underlying melanoma progression and metastasis in older populations remain largely unexplored. Aging might alter phenotypes of cells in the melanoma microenvironment, selecting for populations that support metastatic progression. In this study, we have demonstrated that age engenders the development of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which is linked to phenotypes associated with melanoma metastasis. Among cellular populations enriched by aging were macrophages with a tolerogenic phenotype expressing TREM2 and dysfunctional CD8+ T cells with an exhausted phenotype, whereas macrophages with a profibrotic phenotype expressing TREM1 were depleted. Notably, TREM1 inhibition decreased melanoma growth in young but not in old mice, whereas TREM2 inhibition prevented lung metastasis in aged mice. These data identify age-related targets associated with melanoma metastasis and may guide age-dependent immunotherapeutic strategies. TREM2 is elevated in melanoma-associated macrophages of aged mice and humans and can be inhibited to block melanoma metastasis, highlighting the role of the microenvironment in promoting aging-related metastasis.",

CTCF's impact depends on the genomic context of bound sites and the unique binding properties of WT and mutant CTCF proteins. Specifically, CTCF's signal strength is linked to changes in accessibility, and the ability to block cohesin is linked to its binding stability. Multivariate modeling reveals that both CTCF and accessibility contribute independently to cohesin binding and insulation, but CTCF signal strength has a stronger effect. CTCF and chromatin have a bidirectional relationship such that at CTCF sites, accessibility is reduced in a cohesin-dependent, mutant-specific fashion. In addition, each mutant alters TF binding and accessibility in an indirect manner, changes which impart the most influence on rewiring transcriptional networks and the cell's ability to differentiate. Collectively, the mutant perturbations provide a rich resource for determining CTCF's site-specific effects.",

This retrospective, single-center study aims to describe relevant genomic and clinical features of patients with <i>BRCA</i>-altered uterine sarcoma and the efficacy of PARPis in this population. Eligible patients included all histopathologically confirmed uterine sarcoma with pathogenic <i>BRCA</i> alterations identified through Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center-integrated mutation profiling of actionable cancer targets, excluding carcinosarcoma. Genomic, pathologic, and treatment information was extracted from the cBioPortal database and chart review. Thirty-five patients were identified with uterine sarcoma harboring pathogenic <i>BRCA</i> alterations, including 33 <i>BRCA2</i> alterations (70% homozygous deletions, 3% structural variants, 27% mutations) and two <i>BRCA1</i> mutations. Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) was the most common histology (86%). Thirteen patients with uterine LMS were treated with PARPis in the recurrent/metastatic therapy setting (54% combination therapy regimens) with an overall response rate (ORR) of 46% (1 of 6 for PARPi monotherapy, 5 of 7 for PARPi combination regimens), a clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 62%, and a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 13.2 months (range, 1.0-71.9). The median PFS ratio compared with previous systemic therapy was 1.9 (range, 0.4-53.9), and 58% had a PFS ratio of \u22651.3. The median time on PARPi was 14.5 months (range, 1.3-71.9). The ORR for patients with somatic <i>BRCA2</i> deletions was 60% (n = 6 of 10), with a CBR of 80% (n = 8 of 10).

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor characterized by poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving GBM progression is essential for developing more effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Specifically, investigating Cell Division Cycle-Associated (CDCA) genes offers new perspectives on cell cycle regulation and the proliferation of GBM cells, which are key factors in tumor growth and resistance to treatment. These genes have not been extensively studied in GBM, making them a promising area for targeted research and potential therapeutic interventions. This project was launched to elucidate the pathogenic, diagnostic, and therapeutic roles of CDCA genes in GBM. Total RNA was extracted from GBM cell lines followed by RT-qPCR to analyze the expression of CDCA genes. The expression validation, prognostic significance, and mutational analysis of CDCA genes were performed using various databases. Functional assays, including gene knockdown, colony formation, proliferation, and wound healing, were conducted in U87MG cells to assess the role of CDCA7 and CDCA8 in GBM. The expression analysis of CDCA genes in 12 GBM cell lines and 6 normal brain cell lines revealed significant overexpression of these genes in GBM. ROC curve analysis demonstrated excellent diagnostic potential, with AUC values of 1 for most genes. This indicates that CDCA gene expression effectively distinguishes GBM cells from normal brain cells. Validation using additional TCGA data confirmed the upregulation of these genes in GBM tumors, with significant association to key cancer-related pathways. Survival analysis showed that higher expression of CDCA genes correlated with poor prognosis in GBM patients. Mutation, CNV, and methylation analyses revealed alterations in these genes, further supporting their role in GBM. Additionally, CDCA gene expression was linked to immune modulation and cell cycle-related functions, suggesting their involvement in immune evasion and tumor proliferation. Knockdown experiments of CDCA7 and CDCA8 in U87MG cells demonstrated a reduction in cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. Overall, our findings suggest that CDCA genes could serve as both diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for GBM.",

This study aims to investigate the potential of FA pathway genes as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in breast cancer. In this study, the Oncomine Cancer Microarray (ONCOMINE), University of ALabama at Birmingham Cancer (UALCAN), Kaplan-Meier plotter, cBio Cancer Genomics Portal (cBioPortal), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), Gene Multi-Association Network Integration Algorithm (GeneMANIA), the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) databases were used to investigate the transcriptional and survival data of FA pathway genes in patients with breast cancer. Most of the FA pathway genes were found to be significantly upregulated in breast cancer tissues when compared to normal tissues. Additionally, the elevated expression levels of FA pathway genes were significantly associated with poor survival outcomes in breast cancer patients. Through functional enrichment analysis, the FA pathway genes were positively associated with cell cycle and nucleoplasm and negatively correlated with signal recognition particle-dependent co-translational protein targeting to membrane and ribosome. Furthermore, the expression levels of FA pathway genes exhibited a significant positive association with immune infiltration.

We integrated multiple publicly available databases, including TCGA, TISIDB, TISCH2, and UALCAN, to comprehensively investigate the role of NSUN7 in pan-cancer across various omics data types. The research included examining survival rates, genetic mutations, immune cell presence in tumors, analyzing differences in gene expression, and studying individual cells, among other things. NSUN7 expression showed an increase across 12 cancer types and a decrease in another 12 types. NSUN7 was discovered to be linked with enhanced survival rates in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG), skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), and uveal melanoma (UVM).On the other hand, NSUN7 seemed to have a detrimental impact on the prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme/brain lower grade glioma (GBMLGG), adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC),acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), and brain lower grade glioma (LGG). Furthermore, our experimental validation confirmed the inhibitory effect of NSUN7 on proliferation of renal clear cell carcinoma while elucidating its specific part in blocking cell cycle progression.

However, its influence on the tumor immune microenvironment and its potential as a prognostic indicator regarding immunotherapy responses have yet to be systematically evaluated. This study leverages data retrieved from multiple databases to address these questions. PLIN3 mRNA and protein expressions were analyzed across a diverse range of normal and cancerous tissues, utilizing data retrieved from multiple databases. The potential of PLIN3 as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in cancers was assessed. Advanced computational algorithms were employed to examine the impact of PLIN3 on immune cell infiltration. The association between PLIN3 expression and the presence of M2 macrophages was validated through analyses incorporating bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and multicolor fluorescence staining techniques. Furthermore, the effects of PLIN3 on tumor malignancy and growth were investigated in vitro in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells. Potential compounds targeting PLIN3 were identified using the Connectivity Map (cMap) web tool, and their efficacy was further assessed through molecular docking. PLIN3 was predominantly upregulated in various cancers, correlating with adverse prognostic outcomes. A strong positive association was observed between PLIN3 levels and M2 macrophage infiltration in several cancer types, establishing it as a potential pan-cancer marker for M2 macrophage presence. This was confirmed by integrative multi-omics analysis and multiple fluorescence staining. Additionally, PLIN3 knockdown in LUAD cells diminished their malignant traits, resulting in decreased proliferation and migration. In LUAD, clofibrate was identified as a potential inhibitor of PLIN3's pro-oncogenic functions. PLIN3 may serve as a potential biomarker and oncogene, particularly in LUAD.

This study uncovers LDHB's role in countering mitochondria-associated ferroptosis independently of lactate's function as a carbon source. LDHB silencing alters mitochondrial morphology, causes lipid peroxidation, and reduces cancer cell viability, which is potentiated by the ferroptosis inducer RSL3. Unlike LDHA, LDHB acts in parallel with glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) to suppress mitochondria-associated ferroptosis by decreasing the ubiquinone (coenzyme Q, CoQ) to ubiquinol (CoQH2) ratio. Indeed, supplementation with mitoCoQH2 (mitochondria-targeted analogue of CoQH2) suppresses mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and cell death after combined LDHB silencing and RSL3 treatment, consistent with the presence of LDHB in the cell fraction containing the mitochondrial inner membrane. Addressing the underlying molecular mechanism, an in vitro NADH consumption assay with purified human LDHB reveals that LDHB catalyzes the transfer of reducing equivalents from NADH to CoQ and that the efficiency of this reaction increases by the addition of lactate. Finally, radiation therapy induces mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and reduces tumor growth, which is further enhanced when combined with LDHB silencing. Thus, LDHB-mediated lactate oxidation drives the CoQ-dependent suppression of mitochondria-associated ferroptosis, a promising target for combination therapies.",

          "abstract": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCA) is a type of cancer that starts in the cells lining the esophagus, the tube connecting the throat to the stomach. It is known for its aggressive nature and poor prognosis. Understanding the key factors that drive this cancer is crucial for developing better diagnostic tools and treatments. Gene expression profiles of ESCA were analyzed using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets (GSE23400, GSE29001, GSE92396, and GSE1420) from the GEO database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database. Hub genes were identified based on the degree method. Further validation was performed through reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), mutational and copy number variation (CNV) analysis via the cBioPortal database, promoter methylation analysis using the OncoDB and GSCA databases, survival analysis, immune infiltration analysis through the GSCA database, and functional assays, including knockdown of key genes. We identified four key hub genes, COL3A1, COL4A1, COL5A2, and CXCL8 that play significant roles in ESCA. These genes were highly expressed in ESCA tissues and cell lines, with expression levels significantly (p-value\u2009<\u20090.001) elevated compared to normal controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed exceptional diagnostic performance for all four genes, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 1.0, indicating perfect sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing ESCA from normal controls. Mutational analysis revealed that COL3A1 was altered in 67% of ESCA samples, primarily through missense mutations, while COL5A2 exhibited alterations in 50% of the samples, including splice site and missense mutations. Additionally, gene amplification patterns were observed in all four hub genes, further validating their oncogenic potential in ESCA progression. A significant (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05) promoter hypomethylation was detected in these genes, suggesting a potential regulatory role in their expression. Functional assays demonstrated that knocking down COL3A1 and COL4A1 led to decreased cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration, indicating their critical roles in tumor progression. Additionally, these genes were involved in pathways related to the extracellular matrix and immune system modulation. COL3A1, COL4A1, COL5A2, and CXCL8 are crucial in ESCA development and progression, particularly in remodeling the extracellular matrix, modulating the immune system, and promoting metastasis. These findings suggest that these genes could serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosing ESCA and targets for future therapies. Future research should focus on in vivo validation of these findings and clinical testing to assess the therapeutic potential of targeting these genes in ESCA treatment.",

          "abstract": "FAT1 cadherin exhibits dual tumor suppressor and oncogenic roles across various cancers, but its function in breast cancer remains unclear due to conflicting reports of mutational loss and overexpression. In this study, we demonstrate that FAT1 mRNA and protein levels are reduced during mammary transformation, an effect linked to promoter methylation rather than mutational events. Subtype-specific analysis reveals that high FAT1 expression correlates with poor outcomes in basal-like/triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), while elevated FAT1 expression in luminal A/estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers is associated with improved patient prognosis. Functional studies in TNBC models using knockdown and overexpression approaches confirm that FAT1 promotes both cell proliferation and motility. High-throughput sequencing and biochemical assessments establish strong links between FAT1 phenotypes and the activation of PI3K-AKT signaling. Additionally, FAT1 manipulation induces significant changes in matrisome-related genes, extracellular matrix components, and integrin switching. Together, these findings define an oncogenic role for FAT1 in TNBC, providing mechanistic insights into how its regulation influences AKT signaling, cell proliferation, and motility.",

We investigated BUB1B's role in pan-cancer using TCGA data, analyzing it with platforms like HPA, TIMER, TISIDB, GEPIA, cBioPortal, GDC, LinkedOmics, and CancerSEA. Additionally, we assessed BUB1B's impact on lung adenocarcinoma proliferation and migration through CCK-8, wound healing, transwell assays and Western blot analysis. This study found that BUB1B was upregulated in most cancers and was significantly linked to patient prognosis. Its expression correlated with immune cell infiltration and genetic markers of immunomodulators across different cancers. BUB1B was involved in the acute inflammatory response and IgA production pathways but negatively correlated with inflammation in lung adenocarcinoma. Moreover, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of BUB1B resulted in the inhibition of proliferation and migration of lung cancer cells in vitro.

          "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma, a malignancy originating from the bile ducts, poses significant treatment challenges due to its typically late diagnosis and limited therapeutic options. However, recent advances in molecular genetics enable more personalized treatment approaches. A notable breakthrough in this context is the identification of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations, particularly <i>IDH1</i> and <i>IDH2</i>, which occur in a subset of cholangiocarcinoma patients. Those with <i>IDH1/2</i> mutations may benefit from targeted therapies. For instance, Ivosidenib, an IDH1 inhibitor, has shown efficacy in clinical trials, offering a new therapeutic option for patients with <i>IDH1</i>-mutant cholangiocarcinoma. Developing and implementing standardized protocols for testing and reporting mutation status are crucial for consistency and accuracy in clinical practice. Both the Idylla\u2122 IDH1-2 Mutation Assay Kit as a FastTrack method and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) panels play critical roles in molecular characterization of cholangiocarcinoma. Under this aspect, a set of cholangiocarcinomas was tested using the Idylla\u2122 platform regarding the respective recommended guidelines and standards of DIN EN ISO:17020 and DIN EN ISO:15198. Overall, 25 clinically diagnosed intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas or Adeno-CUPs were analyzed. <i>IDH1/2</i> mutations were identified in 68% (17/25) of cases using both methods, with high concordance between NGS and Idylla\u2122 results. Discrepancies were observed in two samples, where Idylla\u2122 detected no mutations, but NGS reported <i>IDH1</i> and <i>IDH2</i> mutations, respectively. Idylla<sup>TM</sup> offers a rapid, user-friendly, and specific method for detecting <i>IDH1/2</i> mutations, ideal for immediate clinical needs. NGS, while more time-consuming and costly, provides comprehensive genetic profiles valuable for personalized medicine and research. The choice between these methods should be guided by the clinical context, resource availability, and individual patient needs. For routine diagnostics, we recommend an algorithmic approach starting with the FastTrack method followed by NGS for wildtype cases.",

This study aims to elucidate the biological and clinical relevance of RBIS in PCa progression. We analyzed RNA-sequencing data from the TCGA database and three GEO datasets to compare RBIS expression in normal versus tumor tissues. The relationship between RBIS expression and clinicopathological features, including tumor stage, Gleason score, and progression-free survival (PFS), was assessed. Co-expression and functional enrichment analyses identified key biological processes involving RBIS, while genetic alterations, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity were also evaluated. RBIS expression was significantly higher in PCa tissues and correlated with advanced tumor stage, higher Gleason scores, and poorer PFS. Multivariate analysis confirmed RBIS as an independent prognostic marker. Functional analysis implicated RBIS in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. Moreover, RBIS expression was associated with immune cell infiltration and drug sensitivity, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. RBIS represents a promising biomarker for PCa diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Further research is required to validate these findings and advance RBIS's clinical application, offering novel insights into PCa management.",

Notably, SPATA2 was also linked to immune suppression, exhibiting positive correlations with immune checkpoint genes and immune suppressive cells such as regulatory T cells and MDSCs. Furthermore, SPATA2 interacted and co-expressed with proteins involved in DNA repair mechanisms, indicating its potential role in maintaining genomic stability. Finally, we conducted biological experiments to investigate the role of SPATA2 in LIHC. SPATA2\u00a0knockdown enhances the migration and proliferation capabilities of Hep-G2 and HuH7 cell lines.

Here we show that scarcity of VDAC2, and the consequent lack of Bak recruitment to mitochondria, renders hepatocyte mitochondria resistant to permeabilization by truncated Bid (tBid), a Bcl-2 Homology 3 (BH3)-only, Bcl-2 family protein. Increased VDAC2 and Bak is found in most human liver cancers and mitochondria from tumors and hepatic cancer cell lines exhibit VDAC2- and Bak-dependent tBid sensitivity. Exploring potential therapeutic targeting, we find that combinations of activators of the tBid pathway with inhibitors of the Bcl-2 family proteins that suppress Bak activation enhance VDAC2-dependent death of hepatocarcinoma cells with little effect on normal hepatocytes. Furthermore, in vivo, combination of S63845, a selective Mcl-1 inhibitor, with tumor-nectrosis factor-related, apoptosis-induncing ligand (TRAIL) peptide reduces tumor growth, but only in tumors expressing VDAC2. Thus, we describe mitochondrial molecular fingerprint that discriminates liver from hepatocarcinoma and allows sparing normal tissue while targeting tumors.",

In this research, multiple public and in-house patient cohorts were collected to demonstrate the clinical and immune correlations of tumor-stroma proportion (TSP) in BRCA. In addition, in vitro assays uncovered the oncogenic role of TSP-related collagen in BRCA. High TSP status based on hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was associated with positive hormone receptor status, advanced clinical stages, and poor immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response. In addition, we developed a RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)-based stromal score based on four critical genes expression (AEBP1, COL6A3, CTSK, and PLAC9). Both TSP status and stromal score were positively associated with increased M2 macrophage abundance in BRCA. Moreover, tumor collagen has been found to be enriched in samples with the high TSP status, and collagen promoted BRCA cells aggressiveness and macrophage M2 polarization. The tumor stroma was found to be notably related to poor ICB response in patients with BRCA as a result of tumor stroma-macrophage interactions. Thus, the TSP status could predict the clinical outcomes of BRCA patients receiving ICB therapy.",

          "abstract": "Alternative end-joining (alt-EJ) is an error-prone DNA repair pathway that cancer cells deficient in homologous recombination rely on, making them vulnerable to synthetic lethality via inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Targeting alt-EJ effector DNA polymerase theta (POL\u03b8), which synergizes with PARP inhibitors and can overcome resistance, is of significant preclinical and clinical interest. However, the transcriptional regulation of alt-EJ and its interactions with processes driving cancer progression remain poorly understood. Here, we show that alt-EJ is suppressed by hypoxia while positively associated with MYC (myelocytomatosis oncogene) transcriptional activity. Hypoxia reduces <i>PARP1</i> and <i>POLQ</i> expression, decreases MYC binding at their promoters, and lowers PARylation and alt-EJ-mediated DNA repair in cancer cells. Tumors with <i>HIF1A</i> mutations overexpress the alt-EJ gene signature. Inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 or <i>HIF1A</i> expression depletion, combined with PARP or POL\u03b8 inhibition, synergistically reduces the colony-forming capacity of cancer cells. Deep learning reveals the anticorrelation between alt-EJ and hypoxia across regions in tumor images, and the predictions for these and MYC activity achieve area under the curve values between 0.70 and 0.86. These findings further highlight the critical role of hypoxia in modulating DNA repair and present a strategy for predicting and improving outcomes centered on targeting alt-EJ.",

While genome editing technologies have increased the rate and precision of model development, predicting and installing specific types of mutations in mice that mimic the native human genetic context is complicated. Computational tools can identify and align orthologous wild-type genetic sequences from different species; however, predictive modeling and engineering of equivalent mouse variants that mirror the nucleotide and/or polypeptide change effects of human variants remains challenging. Here, we present H2M (human-to-mouse), a computational pipeline to analyze human genetic variation data to systematically model and predict the functional consequences of equivalent mouse variants. We show that H2M can integrate mouse-to-human and paralog-to-paralog variant mapping analyses with precision genome editing pipelines to devise strategies tailored to model specific variants in mice. We leveraged these analyses to establish a database containing > 3 million human-mouse equivalent mutation pairs, as well as <i>in silico</i>-designed base and prime editing libraries to engineer 4,944 recurrent variant pairs. Using H2M, we also found that predicted pathogenicity and immunogenicity scores were highly correlated between human-mouse variant pairs, suggesting that variants with similar sequence change effects may also exhibit broad interspecies functional conservation. Overall, H2M fills a gap in the field by establishing a robust and versatile computational framework to identify and model homologous variants across species while providing key experimental resources to augment functional genetics and precision medicine applications.

The identified genes and lncRNAs are putative therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers. For instance, CRISPR/Cas9 editing systems can be designed in order to modulate expression of these genes, or edit them for the purpose of inducing sensitivity to conventional therapies. Besides, these genes can be incorporated into clinical prognostic models, offering panels of genes to choose appropriate personalized methods of treatment. Together, these genes represent novel markers and possible therapeutic targets for CRC.",

          "abstract": "TMEM9, a transmembrane protein, has emerged as a significant player in tumor progression, yet its comprehensive role across various cancers remains unclear. This study investigates the expression patterns, genetic alterations, immune associations, and prognostic implications of TMEM9 across multiple cancer types using large-scale bioinformatics approaches. TMEM9 expression was analyzed in normal and tumor tissues using data from the TCGA and GTEx databases, with protein expression verified via CPTAC datasets. The prognostic impact of TMEM9 was assessed using overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) analyses across various cancers. Genetic alterations, including mutation types and copy number alterations, were explored using the cBioPortal platform. We also examined DNA methylation, RNA modifications, and immune infiltration correlations using bioinformatics tools, including TIMER2 and UALCAN. TMEM9's relationship with tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) was analyzed, and gene enrichment analyses were performed using the STRING database and GO/KEGG pathway analyses. TMEM9 was significantly overexpressed in several cancers, including ACC, BLCA, BRCA, CHOL, COAD, GBM, and others. Elevated TMEM9 expression correlated with worse OS and DFS in ACC, CESC, KICH, UVM, and additional tumor types. Genetic alterations, predominantly amplifications, were frequent in BRCA, LIHC, and UCEC. DNA methylation analysis revealed hypermethylation in tumors like HNSC and KIRC, while RNA modification analyses showed TMEM9 associations with m6A and m1A-related genes. TMEM9 expression was strongly correlated with immune infiltration, particularly cancer-associated fibroblasts in tumors like THYM and HNSC. Positive associations between TMEM9 and TMB/MSI were observed in several cancers, suggesting genomic instability. Enrichment analyses identified TMEM9 involvement in pathways related to the endoplasmic reticulum, Wnt signaling, and protein processing. TMEM9 plays a crucial role in cancer progression, influencing gene expression, immune modulation, and genomic instability. These findings highlight TMEM9 as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target across multiple cancer types.",

Unlike previous surveys on mass spectrometry-based neoantigen discovery, this survey summarizes the key advancements in de novo peptide sequencing approaches that utilize artificial intelligence. From a comparative study on a dataset of the HepG2 cell line and nine mixed hepatocellular carcinoma proteomics samples, we demonstrated the potential of proteomics for the identification of cancer neoantigens and conducted comparisons of the existing methods to illustrate their limits.

          "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) has increased at an alarming rate amongst younger (< 50 years) individuals. Such early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) has been particularly notable within the Hispanic/Latino population. Yet, this population has not been sufficiently profiled in terms of two critical elements of CRC -- the MYC proto-oncogene and WNT signaling pathway. Here, we performed a comprehensive multi-omics analysis on 30 early-onset and 37 late-onset CRC (\u2265 50 years) samples from Hispanic/Latino patients. Our analysis included DNA exome sequencing for somatic mutations, somatic copy number alterations, and global and local genetic similarity. Using RNA sequencing, we also assessed differential gene expression, cellular pathways, and gene fusions. We then compared our findings from early-onset Hispanic/Latino patient samples with publicly available data from Non-Hispanic White cohorts. Across all early-onset patients, which had a median 1000 Genomes Project Peruvian-in-Lima-like (1KG-PEL-like) genetic similarity proportion of 60%, we identified 41 WNT pathway genes with significant mutations. Six important examples were APC, TCF7L2, DKK1, DKK2, FZD10, and LRP5. Notably, patients with mutations in DKK1 and DKK2 had the highest 1KG-PEL-like proportion (79%). When we compared the Hispanic/Latino cohort to the Non-Hispanic White cohorts, four of these key genes -- DKK1, DKK2, FZD10, and LRP5 -- were significant in both risk association analyses and differential gene expression. Interestingly, early-onset tumors (vs. late-onset) exhibited distinct somatic copy number alterations and gene expression profiles; the differences included MYC and drug-targetable WNT pathway genes. We also identified a novel WNT gene fusion, RSPO3, in early-onset tumors; it was associated with enhanced WNT signaling. This integrative analysis underscores the distinct molecular features of EOCRC cancer in the Hispanic/Latino population; reveals potential avenues for tailored precision medicine therapies; and emphasizes the importance of multi-omics approaches in studying colorectal carcinogenesis. We expect this data to help contribute towards reducing cancer health disparities. This study offers multi-omics profiling analysis of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) in an underserved community, explores the implications of <i>MYC</i> gene and WNT pathway alterations, and provides critical insights into cancer health disparities.",

Elevated FOXM1 gene expression is strongly associated with poor patient survival in GBM. Furthermore, FOXM1 gene expression is correlated with stemness-related factors, such as SOX2 and SOX9, which act as key drivers in the progression of cancer stem cells. Moreover, we specifically look into the direct associations of the FOXM1 gene with angiogenetic-related factors, metabolic genes, metastatic genes, pluripotency-related factors, immune cell infiltration, transcriptional networks, and functional category enrichment analysis, shedding light on the intricate molecular mechanisms involved in GBM initiation and progression. Additionally, our research identifies FOXM1-targeting miRNAs, revealing their potential as therapeutic candidates with implications for patient survival rates and DNA methylation patterns of the FOXM1 gene, uncovering insights into its epigenetic regulation.

This study investigates the clinical significance and prognostic value of CDH18, a calcium-dependent adhesion protein linked to tumor progression, in UCEC. Clinical data from UCEC patients were sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Pan-cancer analysis, differential expression examination, and survival analysis were conducted to investigate the differential expression of the calcium associated protein-CDH18 and its prognostic relevance. CDH18 mutations in UCEC were examined using the cBioPortal database. Additional analyses included functional enrichment, tumor mutational burden, tumor microenvironment (TME) estimates via ESTIMATE, and immune infiltration assessment to clarify CDH18's potential mechanisms in UCEC. Drug sensitivity testing was utilized to identify more suitable therapeutic options for patients. Immunofluorescence staining (IF) and Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction techniques (RT-PCR) confirmed CDH18 expression in UCEC tumor. CDH18 expression was markedly increased in UCEC and showed a significant association with poorer prognosis, which was confirmed by our IF and RT-PCR results. Thirteen mutation sites were identified, and survival analysis showed that patients with higher CDH18 expression had shorter overall survival. The expression of CDH18 was confirmed to be an independent predictor of overall survival by multivariate COX regression analysis. Additionally, a predictive nomogram model was developed to accurately forecast outcomes for individuals with UCEC. Correlation analysis revealed that CDH18 expression exhibited a negative correlation with CD8 T cell levels and a positive correlation with resting NK cell and macrophage M2 levels. In the group with high CDH18 expression, the IC50 values for (5Z)-7-Oxozeaenol, AG-014699, CEP-701, Mitomycin C, PD-0325901, PD-0332991, PHA-665752, SL 0101-1, and SN-38 were notably elevated.

          "abstract": "The protein kinase ERK2 is recurrently mutated in human squamous cell carcinomas and other tumors. ERK2 mutations cluster in an essential docking recruitment site that interacts with short linear motifs found within intrinsically disordered regions of ERK substrates and regulators. Cancer-associated mutations do not disrupt ERK2 docking interactions altogether but selectively inhibit some interactions while sparing others. However, the full scope of disrupted or maintained interactions remains unknown, limiting our understanding of how these mutations contribute to cancer. We recently defined the docking interactome of wild-type ERK2 by screening a yeast two-hybrid library of proteomic short linear motifs. Here, we apply this approach to the two most recurrent cancer-associated mutants. We find that most sequences binding to WT ERK2 also interact with both mutant forms. Analysis of differentially interacting sequences revealed that ERK2 mutants selectively lose the ability to bind sequences conforming to a specific motif. We solved the co-crystal structure of ERK2 in complex with a peptide fragment of ISG20, a screening hit that binds exclusively to the WT kinase. This structure demonstrated the mechanism by which cancer hotspot mutations at Glu81, Arg135, Asp321, and Glu322 selectively impact peptide binding. Finally, we found that cancer-associated ERK2 mutations had decreased activity in phosphorylating GEF-H1/ARHGEF2, a known ERK substrate harboring a WT-selective docking motif. Collectively, our studies provide a structural rationale for how a broad set of interactions are disrupted by ERK2 hotspot mutations, suggesting mechanisms for pathway rewiring in cancers harboring these mutations.",

However, its role across different cancer types is not well understood. Utilizing multi-omics data, we comprehensively evaluated ITGA4's expression, clinical relevance, diagnostic and prognostic value, functions, mutations, and methylation status, along with its impact on immunity, mismatch repair (MMR), heterogeneity, stemness, immunotherapy responsiveness, and drug resistance in pan-cancer, with partial validation in gastric cancer (GC) using transcriptomic analysis, single-cell data, western blot (WB), wound-healing assay, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (IHC). We further investigated its correlation with clinicopathology and serological markers on tissues from 80 GC patients. ITGA4 expression was generally low in normal tissues but varied significantly across tumor types, with higher levels in advanced stages and grades. It demonstrated diagnostic value in 20 cancer types and effectively predicted 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates as part of a prognostic model. ITGA4 played roles in cell adhesion, migration, immune regulation, and pathways like PI3K-Akt and TSC-mTOR. It showed alterations in 22 cancer types, with methylation at 9 sites inhibiting its expression. ITGA4 positively correlated with immune cell infiltration, immune regulatory genes, chemokines, and might reduce microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutation burden (TMB) by promoting MMR gene expression. It could also predict immunotherapy efficacy and chemotherapy sensitivity. In GC, high ITGA4 expression was related to poor prognosis, promoted tumor proliferation and migration, and enhanced immune cell infiltration. ITGA4 expression was higher in GC cells and tissues than normal ones. Its downregulation inhibited GC cell migration and promoted apoptosis. Moreover, ITGA4 was correlated with N stage, pathological stage, neural and vascular invasion, serum levels of Ki-67, immune cells, CRP and CA125.

Active compounds and targets of SR were identified through the TCMSP and Pharmmapper databases, while LC-related targets were sourced from GEO, GeneCards, OMIM, and PharmGkb databases. A Venn diagram generated from these datasets highlighted 58 overlapping targets. The STRING database and Cytoscape 3.9.1 software facilitated the construction of a protein-protein interaction network for these targets, and R language analysis revealed 15 core targets. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, conducted with the ''clusterProfiler'' package, identified relevant biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions associated with LC treatment. KEGG analysis suggested SR primarily regulates pathways such as TNF, IL-17, and P53. Molecular docking confirmed SR's ability to bind effectively to the 15 core targets. Molecular dynamics simulations further validated stable protein-ligand interactions for MAPK1, GSK3B, and MAPK14. Core target validation across transcriptional, translational, and immune infiltration levels was performed using GEPIA, HPA, cBioPortal, and TIMER databases.

Similarly, high-podoplanin (n\u00a0= 31) versus low-podoplanin (n\u00a0= 62) expression in CAFs was not associated with worse disease-free survival after surgery (<i>p</i>\u00a0= 0.65), but was significantly associated with worse PFS and showed a trend towards worse overall survival following osimertinib treatment (<i>p</i> < 0.001, <i>p</i>\u00a0= 0.11). In the multivariable analysis, solid predominant histology and high-podoplanin expression in CAFs were independently associated with worse PFS. In the cohorts of The Cancer Genome Atlas Program and Singapore Oncology Data Portal, <i>EGFR</i>-mutated lung adenocarcinoma with solid predominant histology or high-podoplanin expression exhibited significantly higher HGF expression. Solid predominant histology and high-podoplanin expression in CAFs predicted osimertinib resistance, potentially guiding the selection of patients for more intensive treatments beyond osimertinib monotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) is primarily recognized for its role in retinoid transport, but has recently been implicated in cancer progression and prognosis. However, a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of RBP4's expression, prognostic significance, and functional associations across various cancers is lacking. We conducted a pan-cancer analysis of RBP4 using data from public databases. RBP4 expression levels were examined in 33 tumor types, and correlations with clinical outcomes, immune cell infiltration, DNA methylation, and gene mutations were assessed. Enrichment analyses of RBP4 and its co-expressed genes were performed to explore associated biological pathways. Additionally, in vitro experiments were conducted to assess the effects of RBP4 on cell migration and proliferation. RBP4 showed differential expression between tumor and normal tissues, with downregulation in 21 cancer types and upregulation in 6. High expression levels of RBP4 were associated with poor overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free interval (PFI) in specific cancers, notably in BRCA, HNSC, and STAD, whereas it was a favorable prognostic factor in cancers such as KIRP and MESO. RBP4 expression was also associated with immune cell infiltration, particularly with CD4+ Th2 cells and immune checkpoint genes. DNA methylation analysis suggested that the methylation of RBP4 may play a role in its regulatory mechanisms across cancer types. Enrichment analyses revealed that RBP4 and its co-expressed genes are involved in metabolism-related pathways and immune regulation. Functional assays indicated that RBP4 knockdown promoted tumor cell migration and proliferation. This study provides a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of RBP4, identifying its prognostic potential and possible involvement in tumor immunity and metabolism. Our findings suggest that RBP4 could serve as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer, although further experimental studies are required to elucidate its precise mechanisms in specific cancer types.",

While therapeutic inhibition of oncogene-encoded kinases has shown clinical success, restoring TS functions remains challenging due to conceptual and technical limitations. E3 ubiquitin ligases that ubiquitinate TS proteins for accelerated degradation in cancers emerge as promising therapeutic targets. Unlike proteasomal inhibitors with a broad spectrum, inhibitors of an E3 ligase would offer superior selectivity and efficacy in enhancing expression of its substrate TS proteins as far as the TS proteins retain wild-type structures. Recent advances in developing E3 inhibitors, including MDM2 inhibitors, highlight their potential and ultimately guide the framework to establish E3 inhibition as effective strategies to treat specific types of cancers. This review explores E3 ligases that negatively regulate bona fide TS proteins, the developmental status of E3 inhibitors, and their promise and pitfalls as therapeutic agents for anti-cancer precision medicine.",

Comparative analysis reveals a distinct genomic alteration between younger and elder patients with NSCLC, with ERBB2 mutations and ALK-rearrangement strikingly more frequent in younger group. Transcriptome profiling indicates altered cellular metabolism and immune-related genes in tumors from younger patients. Immunological analysis reveals a decreased infiltration of immune cells (notably T cells) in tumors from younger patients. Cellular and mechanistic studies show that the prevalent ERBB2 mutants in cancer from younger patients can indeed drive tumorigenesis by elevating AKT signaling. Importantly, meta-analysis of clinical trials and our clinical practice further validate the promise of HER2-targeted therapy to treat early-onset NSCLC in East Asian patients. Our comprehensive and integrative analysis not only reveal multiple unrecognized characteristics of early-onset lung cancer, but also inform actionable therapeutics to manage this type of cancer.",

This process is orchestrated by mitochondria and is under the control of several genes, such as PPRC1 (PRC), a member of the PGC-1 family, which is a key player in the transcription control of mitochondrial biogenesis. We have shown here that eugenol inhibits cell growth and promotes apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway in AML cell lines as well as in cells from AML patients but not in cells from healthy donors. Similar effects were also observed on cytarabine-resistant AML cells. Interestingly, eugenol downregulated PPRC1 at both the protein and mRNA levels and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in AML cells. We have also shown that PPRC1 expression is higher in cancer cells from blood, breast, and other types of cancer relative to normal cells, and high PPRC1 levels correlate significantly with short overall survival (OS). In addition, PPRC1 gene mutations significantly correlate with short OS and/or disease-free survival in several cancers. PPRC1 mutations also correlated significantly with poor OS (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) when tested in a total of 23,456 cancer patients. These findings suggest an oncogenic role of PPRC1 in various types of cancer and the possible eugenol-targeting of this gene for the treatment of AML patients, especially those exhibiting resistance to cytarabine.",

To identify regulators of TNBC, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in both three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroid and two-dimensional cell culture models. The 3D spheroid model displayed unique potential in identifying putative tumor suppressors because of its closer mimicry of in vivo tumor growth conditions. Notably, the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex emerged as a potent suppressor of tumor spheroid growth. Specifically, loss of the SWI/SNF ATPase subunit SMARCA4 promoted tumor spheroid growth with reduced compactness and enhanced primary tumor growth and metastasis across multiple TNBC models. SMARCA4 was required for the transcription of the Rho GTPase-activating factor ARHGAP29 by enhancing DNA accessibility through direct binding to its promoter. SMARCA4 loss resulted in reduced ARHGAP29 levels and hyperactive RHOA signaling, subsequently disrupting cell adhesion, facilitating the formation of a loose spheroid structure in vitro, and enhancing breast cancer growth and metastasis in vivo. These results establish SMARCA4 and SWI/SNF as tumor suppressors of TNBC through suppression of RHOA activity. Significance: CRISPR-knockout screen in 3D tumor spheroid revealed that SMARCA4, a SWI/SNF ATPase subunit, suppresses triple-negative breast cancer growth and metastasis by increasing ARHGAP29 transcription and inhibiting the RHOA signaling pathway.",

Finally, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to validate the expression levels of the key genes. A total of 323 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. From the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, 37 hub genes were selected.

A comprehensive analysis of the expression and prognostic relevance of CBX1-8 in BC was conducted comprehensively using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and multiple databases. High mRNA expression of CBX2, CBX3, and CBX5 in BC patients was significantly associated with reduced overall survival (OS). Results from univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the mRNA expression level of CBX2 in BC patients served as an independent prognostic factor. In Luminal A and Luminal B BC subtypes, high expression of CBX2 correlated with unfavorable prognosis. Subsequent Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses indicated a strong association between CBX2 and the cell cycle as well as DNA replication processes. CCK-8 and EdU assays demonstrated that silencing CBX2 inhibited the proliferation of T47D and MCF7 cell lines. Moreover, the cell cycle assay indicated that CBX2 silencing led to cell cycle arrest, accompanied by a significant decrease in the levels of CDK4 and CyclinD1. Elevated CBX2 expression significantly correlated with the infiltration of T cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells in BC.

          "abstract": "The Homeobox (HOX) gene family are conserved transcription factors that are essential for embryonic development, oncogenesis, and cancer suppression in biological beings. Abnormally expressed HOX genes in cancers are directly associated with prognosis. Public databases such as TCGA and the R language were used to perform pan-cancer analyses of the HOX family in terms of expression, prognosis, and immune microenvironment. The HOX score was defined, and potential target compounds in cancers were predicted by Connective Map. Immunohistochemistry was employed to validate protein expression levels. Gene knockdowns were used to verify the effects of HOXB7 and HOXC6 on the proliferation and migration of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells. HOX genes play different roles in different cancers. Many HOX genes, especially HOXB7 and HOXC6, have higher expression and lower overall survival in specific cancers and are predicted as risk factors. The high expression of most HOX genes is mainly related to immune subtypes C1-C4 and C6. Potential anti-tumor compounds for down-regulating HOX gene expression were identified, such as HDAC inhibitors and tubulin inhibitors. LUAD Cell migration and proliferation were inhibited when HOXB7 or HOXC6 was knocked down. Many HOX genes may act as both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, necessitating precision medicine based on specific cancers. The HOX gene family plays a crucial role in the development of certain cancers, and their expression patterns are closely related to cancer prognosis and the tumor microenvironment (TME), which may affect cancer prognosis and response to immunotherapy. Compounds that are negatively correlated with the expression levels of the HOX family in various cancers, such as HDAC inhibitors, are potential anti-cancer drugs. HOXB7 and HOXC6 may serve as potential targets for cancer treatment and the development of targeted compounds in the future.",

          "abstract": "Mitochondria-associated paraplegin dysfunction is primarily linked to spastic paraplegia; however, genetic alterations in SPG7 have been associated with a broader spectrum of clinical symptoms. To identify disease-causing variants in the SPG7 gene, 437 patients with spastic ataxia, mitochondrial dysfunction-associated symptoms, or motoneuron lesions detected by EMG have been tested. We aimed to assess the clinical spectrum and determine the frequency of damaging variants within patient groups, particularly those less studied. Using ACMG criteria, we identified 10 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, 5 variants of uncertain significance with predicted damaging effects, and a probable risk factor variant in 58 patients. We identified 25 biallelic and 33 monoallelic cases. The most common variant was p. Leu78Ter (N\u2009=\u200923), followed by p. Ala510Val (N\u2009=\u200921). The point prevalence of SPG7-associated conditions in Hungary in 2024 is 0.46 per 100\u2009000. In addition to well-characterized cohorts, SPG7 alterations were frequently identified in cohorts with multisystemic mitochondrial disease and lower motoneuron lesions. Multiple mtDNA deletions and histological abnormalities were consistently observed across all groups. In monoallelic cases, no evidence of a digenic effect involving AFG3L2 was found. Both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance patterns were documented, with monoallelic cases typically presenting with a milder phenotype.",

The aim of this study is to find the biological and prognostic significance of necroptosis in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Integrated clinical datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HNSCC cohort underwent analysis. R package \"DESeq2\" was used to conduct differential gene expression analysis between normal and tumor tissues in the cohort, resulting in the identification of 2,172 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A total of 159 necroptosis-related genes (NRGs) were extracted and performed a Venn analysis to identify the optimal necroptosis-related DEGs, resulting in the selection of 25 genes specifically associated with necroptosis in HNSCC. Then prognostic analyze, Cox regression analysis and prognostic model were demonstrated the ability to predict the extent of immunological infiltration in HNSCC. Among these DEGs, five genes (<i>FADD, H2AZ1, PYGL, JAK3</i>, and <i>ZBP1</i>) were found to have prognostic value (P<0.05). Then, bioinformatic analyses were conducted, and the biological and clinical significance of these five genes were demonstrated. Furthermore, Cox regression analysis was performed to develop a prognostic gene model based on these genes, which effectively classified HNSCC patients into low- or high-risk groups. The prognostic model also demonstrated the ability to predict the extent of immunological infiltration in HNSCC. Additionally, a predictive nomogram based on the clinicopathological features of these five prognostic DEGs was constructed. We performed a systematic bioinformatic analysis to identify necroptosis-related prognostic genes in HNSCC patients. These genes' prognostic value was synthesized into a predictive nomogram for forecasting HNSCC progression.",

Here, we elucidate the role of MLL3 mutations as early, clonal genomic events in UASCC tumorigenesis, highlighting their role as foundational drivers of cancer development. Utilizing CRISPR-edited, cross-species organoid modeling, we demonstrate that loss of MLL3 contributes to early squamous neoplastic evolution. Furthermore, we identify an MLL3/GRHL2 protein complex that regulates the UASCC epigenome, particularly impacting immune response pathways. Notably, a novel MLL3/GRHL2-IRF1 axis promotes the expression of Th1 chemokines, enhancing anti-tumor immunity by facilitating T cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment. Consequently, MLL3 regulates the in vivo efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, corroborated by the strong association between MLL3 expression and human patients' clinical response to ICB therapy. Our work underscores the significance of MLL3 in UASCC pathogenesis and highlights the interplay between MLL3/GRHL2 and immune response pathways as potential therapeutic targets for UASCC treatment.",

          "abstract": "The goal of this study was to investigate the role and therapeutic targeting of T-type calcium channels in medulloblastoma, a common and deadly pediatric brain tumor that arises in the cerebellum. T-type calcium channel expression was assessed in publicly available bulk and single cell RNA-seq datasets. The effects of T-type calcium channel blocker mibefradil on cell growth, death and invasion were assessed with cell counting, alamar blue, trypan blue and transwell assays. Proteomic-based drug target and signaling pathway mapping was performed with Reverse Phase Protein Arrays (RPPA). Co-expression modules of single cell RNA-seq data were generated using high dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis (hdWGCNA). Orthotopic xenografts were used for therapeutic studies with the T-Type calcium channel blocker mibefradil. T-type calcium channels were upregulated in more than 30% of medulloblastoma tumors and patients with high expression associated with a worse prognosis. T-type calcium channels had variable expression across all the subgroups of medulloblastoma at the bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq level. Mibefradil treatment or siRNA mediated silencing of T-type calcium channels inhibited tumor cell growth, viability and invasion. RPPA-based protein/phosphoprotein signal pathway activation mapping of T-type calcium channel inhibition and single cell hdWGCNA identified altered cancer signaling pathways. Oral administration of mibefradil inhibited medulloblastoma xenograft growth and prolonged animal survival. Our results represent a first comprehensive multi-omic characterization of T-type calcium channels in medulloblastoma and provide preclinical data for repurposing mibefradil as a treatment strategy for these relatively common pediatric brain tumors.",

A few studies suggest that liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) may be associated with TACE refractoriness. This study aims to explore the potential correlation between TACE refractoriness and HCC stemness, highlighting its clinical significance. This research encompassed the analysis of diverse HCC datasets, including RNA-sequencing, microarray, single-cell RNA-sequencing, and clinical cohorts. We identified common genes between TACE refractoriness and tumor stemness (TSGs). Unsupervised clustering was employed to classify HCC patients into different clusters based on TSGs (TRS clusters). The study explored the differences in clinical prognosis, biological characteristics, genomic variations, immune landscapes, and treatment responses among the TRS clusters. Patients with TACE-refractoriness demonstrated significantly higher tumor stemness. Our study identified 33 TSGs and established two TRS clusters, including C1 and C2. C1 was associated with TACE refractoriness, elevated tumor stemness, and poorer prognosis. Genomic alterations were found to be significantly different between the TRS clusters. The C1 exhibited signs of immunosuppression and lower activity of immune effector cells, while the C2 had a more robust immune response and higher level of immune cell presence. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed distinct cell type characteristics in each subtypes, with the C1 showing a higher proportion of stem cells and malignant cells. Our findings establish a connection between TACE refractoriness and tumor stemness in HCC, proposing a novel subtype classification to guide personalized treatment. Insights gained may facilitate overcoming TACE refractoriness and the development of innovative therapies.",

          "abstract": "Cancer is a significant global health problem characterized by increased incidence and large disparities in outcomes. There is a compelling\u00a0need to identify novel biomarkers to enhance early detection, prognosis, and tailored therapies. Growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) is a long noncoding RNA\u00a0(lncRNA) with potential as a tumor suppressor in a subset of cancers. Its roles in the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy across cancer types remain underexplored. In this study, a pan-cancer comprehensive analysis of the expression status of GAS5 was conducted using various bioinformatics tools and genomic datasets, including Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Data Analysis Portal (UALCAN), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The expression of GAS5 in different types of cancers was determined and then evaluated for its correlation with clinicopathological parameters, immune cell infiltration, survival outcome, and the methylation status of its promoter. Additionally, the Kaplan-Meier plotter (KMP) was used for overall survival assessment, and the cBioPortal tool was applied for genetic alteration and radiation therapy response assessment. Functional analyses were performed using data from the Long Noncoding RNA Cancer Arrays (lnCAR) database, which included coexpression networks, competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) interactions, and pathway\u00a0enrichment. Our analysis, based on three large datasets, showed that GAS5 was significantly upregulated mainly in cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) (p < 0.05). On the contrary, it was downregulated in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), kidney chromophobe (KICH), and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). High GAS5 expression was associated with poor overall survival in LIHC and KIRC (p < 0.05). Promoter hypomethylation was identified as a key regulatory mechanism in CHOL, KIRC, and LIHC\u00a0(p < 0.05). GAS5 expression exhibited positive correlations with immune cell infiltration (e.g., CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and macrophages) in LIHC and negative correlations (e.g., B cells, dendritic cells) in KIRC. Our network analysis has established GAS5 as a ceRNA\u00a0that interacts with 36 miRNAs and 95 protein-coding genes, affecting pathways like metabolism, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions in LIHC\u00a0(p < 0.05). The genetic alterations may have an impact on GAS5 expression levels and how it functions during radiation treatment. Furthermore, the epigenetic control of GAS5 by DNA methylation suggests possible targets for personalized treatment methods. This comprehensive analysis across various cancers offers a significant foundation for GAS5 as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, especially prominent in LIHC, with additional relevance in KIRC. Identification of tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms and correlations with immune cells opens new perspectives into the context-dependent functionality of GAS5. These findings highlight the potential of GAS5 for developing targeted therapies and advancing personalized medicine, paving the way for future research into GAS5-based treatment strategies in cancer.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of HSPG2 in pan-cancer and to analyze its possible mechanisms. We used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) to explore the expression of HSPG2 in 33 tumors and corresponding controls. Univariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were applied to detect the effects of HSPG2 on overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free interval (PFI) in patients with these tumors, and to analyze the relationship between HSPG2 and clinical characteristics. And we further analyzed the relationship between HSPG2 and immune infiltration, DNA methylation and single cell function. And GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed using HSPG2 co-expressed genes. Finally, we explored the diagnostic efficacy of HSPG2 for diseases of interest and validated it using qPCR experiment. HSPG2 was lowly expressed in 17 cancers and highly expressed in 11 cancers, and was correlated with patient's clinical characteristics in many cancers. Multivariate regression analysis showed that HSPG2 was an independent prognostic factor for DSS, OS, and PFI in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) and Mesothelioma (MESO). HSPG2 was correlated with DNA methylation, single-cell function, and immune infiltration in a variety of cancers. HSPG2 exhibited a good diagnostic efficacy for BLCA and MESO. qPCR and western blot results showed that HSPG2 expression was increased in mesothelioma compared to normal controls. These findings suggest that HSPG2 could be considered as a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for BLCA and MESO.",

In addition, the biological function of RIPK3 in leukemic development was further verified through in vitro experiments. Based on the GEPIA database, we screened that RIPK3 overexpression among RIPK family was associated with poor prognosis in AML. Afterwards, another independent cohort from our research center further confirmed the expression pattern of RIPK3 in AML patients. Clinically, increased RIPK3 expression was closely related to specific subtypes of AML, such as FAB-M4/M5, normal karyotype and NPM1 mutation. The significant association of RIPK3 overexpression with FAB-M4/M5 was further validated in AML cell lines. Notably, AML patients with RIPK3 overexpression received transplantation presented a markedly longer survival than those just receiving chemotherapy, whereas those with RIPK3 underexpression showed similar survival between transplantation and chemotherapy group. Bioinformatics analysis showed the significant association of RIPK3 expression with diverse oncogenes/tumor suppressor genes and tumor-related biological processes in AML. Subsequently, we further performed functional experiments in vitro confirmed the potential oncogenic role of RIPK3 in AML. Overexpression of RIPK3 was associated with specific subtypes of AML, such as FAB-M4/M5, normal karyotype and NPM1 mutation, and may facilitate the leukemic development. Moreover, RIPK3 overexpression was associated poor prognosis, and may guide treatment choice in AML.",

          "abstract": "Invasive growth and metastatic dissemination represent the primary cause of death in cancer patients. In order to successfully detach from the primary tumour and establish metastases in distant tissues, cancer cells need to dynamically rewire their cell adhesion machinery. Here we revisit the potential association of MCAM, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that was initially identified as a melanoma antigen, with disease progression. Using immunohistochemical stainings and bioinformatic analyses of published datasets, we find abundant MCAM expression both in primary and metastatic human melanomas. In additional bioinformatic analyses, we show that MCAM is highly expressed in foetal melanocytes and subsequently downregulated during melanocyte maturation. Bioinformatic inference of cellular communication networks reveals that melanoma cells with high MCAM expression more actively engage in signalling crosstalk with endothelial cells. Experimental investigations demonstrate that disruption of MCAM in melanoma cells inhibits their migration on endothelial cell surfaces in\u00a0vitro and decreases their ability to develop spontaneous lung metastases in\u00a0vivo. Taken together, our results could not confirm the notion that MCAM expression represents a useful biomarker for disease progression but provide evidence that MCAM expression might represent part of a reactivated embryonal transcriptional program that facilitates melanoma-endothelial cell interactions during metastatic progression.",

          "abstract": "For most colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, expanding the benefits of immunotherapy, particularly through blocking programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), is crucial, especially in cases with limited response to neoadjuvant therapy. This study investigates the role of Myoferlin (MYOF) as a novel target in CRC immunotherapy. Human CRC cell lines (RKO, HCT116), normal intestinal epithelial cells (HIEC-6), and the murine CRC cell line MC38 were used to study the effects of apatinib and MYOF in CRC cells. RNA sequencing, the CPTAC and TCGA databases, and other molecular and cellular methods were applied to disclose the mechanisms involved. A series of mouse models were established to assess the effects of apatinib and MYOF knockdown on tumor progression, immune cell infiltration, and immune checkpoint protein response. We found that MYOF is overexpressed in CRC and linked to immune cell infiltration and checkpoint expression. Suppression of MYOF expression significantly inhibited CRC cell proliferation and migration, as well as reduced PD-L1 protein levels. Integrative analysis showed that apatinib modulates MYOF expression via VEGFR2, resulting in decreased PD-L1 expression, increased CD8+ T cell infiltration, and reduced pro-tumor M2 macrophages. Animal experiments further revealed that apatinib treatment or MYOF knockdown enhanced the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in CRC. These findings highlight novel antitumor mechanisms of MYOF and suggest that combining apatinib with ICB therapy may improve CRC treatment outcomes, offering a promising strategy to enhance immune responses.",

          "abstract": "<i>Background.</i> The Hippo pathway is the most frequently altered signaling in pleural mesothelioma (PM). Epithelioid PM (ePM) is associated with better outcome than non-epithelioid subtypes, but its prognosis can be heterogeneous. Here, we tried to stratify ePM using the expression levels of the Hippo-TEAD network. <i>Methods.</i> Thirty patients with ePM were included in this study. Tumors were stratified using the expression levels of 74 genes belonging to the Hippo-TEAD network and using the non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. Results were validated using ePM cases from the TCGA cohort. Alterations associated with the molecular subgroups were investigated using mutation and copy number alteration data from TCGA. <i>Results.</i> Two groups of ePM (i.e., HP1 and HP2) were identified and validated using TCGA data. HP2 comprises about one-third of tumors. These tumors are frequently high-grade (73% vs. 35%), have higher levels of downstream Hippo effectors (i.e., <i>YAP1</i>, <i>WWTR1</i> and <i>TEADs</i>), lower levels of <i>VSIR</i>-which encodes for VISTA-and poorer PFS and OS. HP2 tumors commonly harbor homodeletions in Hippo core suppressors (25% vs. 3%), while no specific gene mutation or copy number alterations of Hippo genes was associated with the two groups. <i>Conclusions.</i> ePM can be stratified in prognostic subtypes based on the expression levels of the Hippo-TEAD network. Higher levels of downstream Hippo effectors are associated with poor response to platinum-pemetrexed doublet and worse OS. The stratification of ePM based on the activation of the YAP/TAZ-TEAD axis is an intriguing approach in the light of the inhibitors of this signaling that are currently under investigation.",

          "abstract": "The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (Rb) is a multifunctional protein that primarily regulates the cell cycle but also has roles in cellular differentiation, DNA damage response, and apoptosis. The loss of Rb is a key event in the development or progression of many cancers. Essential functions of Rb occur through its pocket domain, which is necessary for regulating binding interactions with E2F transcription factors and transcription repressors that bind via an LxCxE motif. The pocket domain is the most highly conserved region of the multidomain protein, as well as the most frequent site of mutations. To understand what effects cancer missense mutations have on Rb's pocket domain, we used fluorescence polarization and differential scanning fluorimetry to quantify changes caused by 75 cancer-associated missense variants to E2F transactivation domain (E2F<sup>TD</sup>) binding, LxCxE binding, and the thermostability of the pocket domain. We find that 43% of the missense variants tested reduce Rb-E2F<sup>TD</sup> binding. Many of these variants are not located at the E2F<sup>TD</sup>-binding site, yet they destabilize the fold of the protein and show temperature-sensitive binding effects. We also find that 21% of tested mutations reduce LxCxE binding, and several mutations selectively disrupt either E2F<sup>TD</sup> or LxCxE binding. Protein X-ray crystallography of four missense variants reveals how mutations destabilize the protein fold and inhibit E2F<sup>TD</sup> or LxCxE binding. Taken together, this work provides the first understanding of the multiple ways through which stability, structure, and function of Rb's pocket domain are altered by common missense mutations seen in cancer.",

This study aimed to validate the association between FGFR-related profile of the stroma and FGFR2 prognostic value in oestrogen receptor-positive invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). An <i>in silico</i> gene expression analysis identified 12 stromal factors (<i>FAP, CXCL12, PDGFRA, COL1A1, HSPG2, CCL2, MMP14, S100A4, MMP9, PDGFA, MCAM, IL6</i>) forming an \"FGFR-related profile of the stroma\". A cohort of 257 ER+ IDC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was analysed. Tumours were clustered using k-means based on stromal gene expression, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association between FGFR2 and overall survival (OS). Two clusters of ER+ IDC tumours were identified based on the stromal gene expression profile. While both clusters had similar tumour stages and hormone receptor statuses, multivariable analysis adjusted for clinical factors revealed a significant association between <i>FGFR2</i> expression and cluster assignment.

Benzo[a]pyrene metabolizes in cells to benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) and reacts with guanine nucleotides to form bulky BPDE adducts. These DNA adducts block transcription and replication, compromising cell function and survival, and are repaired in human cells by the nucleotide excision repair pathway. Here, we applied high-resolution genomic assays to measure BPDE-induced damage formation and mutagenesis in human cells. We integrated the new damage and mutagenesis data with previous repair, DNA methylation, RNA expression, DNA replication, and chromatin component measurements in the same cell lines, along with lung cancer mutagenesis data. BPDE damage formation is significantly enhanced by DNA methylation and in accessible chromatin regions, including transcribed and early-replicating regions. Binding of transcription factors is associated primarily with reduced, but also enhanced damage formation, depending on the factor. While DNA methylation does not appear to influence repair efficiency, this repair was significantly elevated in accessible chromatin regions, which accumulated fewer mutations. Thus, when damage and repair drive mutagenesis in opposing directions, the final mutational patterns appear to be dictated by the efficiency of repair rather than the frequency of underlying damages.",

Although aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of cancer, emerging evidence suggest OXPHOS is frequently enhanced, providing metabolic advantages for cell proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance in a variety of aggressive cancer types including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here it is reported that POU-domain containing family protein POU3F3 is translocated into the nuclei of NSCLC cell lines harboring mutant RAS, where it activates transcription of ATP5PF, an essential component of mitochondrial ATP synthase and consequent ATP production, leading to enhanced NSCLC proliferation and migration. Moreover, it is further found out that ERK1 phosphorylates POU3F3 at the S393 site in the cytoplasm and promotes the nuclear translocation of POU3F3 via receptor importin \u03b21 in RAS mutant NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing analysis combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that POU3F3 binds to the promoter of ATP5PF, leading to enhanced ATP5PF transcription and ATP production. Together, this study uncovers a novel RAS-POU3F3-ATP5PF axis in facilitating NSCLC progression, providing a new perspective on the understanding of molecular mechanisms for NSCLC progression.",

We also discover an association between UCK2 expression and immune cells by CIBERSORT algorithm, ESTIMATE algorithm and ssGSEA algorithm, especially, related to T cell, monocytes, mast cells, and macrophages. This study aims to shed light on the role and possible mechanism of UCK2 in pan-cancer. We used the R programming language for pan-cancer bulk sequencing data analysis, which were obtained from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) datasets. UCSC database is a very useful for explore data from TCGA and other cancer genomics datasets, The data we explored at the UCK2 transcriptome level came from TCGA data in the UCSC database. We explored differential UCK2 expression between tumor and normal samples. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was utilized to validate the expression of UCK2 in different types cancers using tumor tissue chips. The correlations of UCK2 with prognosis, genetic instability, DNA repair, cancer stem cell characteristics, and immune cell infiltration were investigated. Furthermore, single-cell datasets, acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, were used to validate the relationship between UCK2 and immune cells. GEO is a famous public genomics database supporting freely disseminates microarray data. Finally, we analyzed the correlation between UCK2 and drug sensitivity. UCK2 expression was observed to be high in most cancers and was remarkably related to the prognosis of pan-cancers. We found that the increased UCK2 expression was associated with higher genetic instability. Additionally, positive relationships were observed between UCK2 expression and mismatch repair genes, homologous recombination repair genes, and cancer stemness across different cancer types. There were significant correlations between UCK2 and T cells, monocytes, mast cells, and macrophages. Moreover, as expected, the immune checkpoint human leucocyte antigen (HLA) was found to be negatively related to UCK2. Similarly, UCK2 was also observed to have a negative association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. We noted that UCK2 had significant correlations with the sensitivity to various anti-cancer drug. We have observed that UCK2 plays pivotal roles in prognosis and tumor immunity, and it is associated with DNA repair and cancer stemness. The UCK2 gene exhibits a strong correlation with the immune checkpoints HLA. This study highlights its potential impact on drug sensitivity.",

This study employed a detailed in silico and in vitro experiments-based methodology. RT-qPCR assays reveal significantly elevated mRNA levels of CDCA2, CDCA3, CDCA4, CDCA5, CDCA7, and CDCA8 genes in COAD cell lines compared to controls. Bisulfite sequencing indicates reduced promoter methylation of CDCA gene promoters in COAD cell lines, suggesting an epigenetic regulatory mechanism. Analysis of large TCGA datasets confirms increased CDCA gene expression in COAD tissues. Survival analysis using cSurvival database demonstrates negative correlations between CDCA gene expression and patient overall survival. Additionally, Lasso regression-based models of CDCA genes predict survival outcomes in COAD patients. Investigating immune modulation, CDCA gene expression inversely correlates with immune cell infiltration and immune modulators. miRNA-mRNA network analysis identifies regulatory miRNAs targeting CDCA genes, validated by RT-qPCR showing up-regulation of has-mir-10a-5p and has-mir-20a-5p in COAD cell lines and tissues. Drug sensitivity analysis suggests resistance to specific drugs in COAD patients with elevated CDCA gene expression. Furthermore, CDCA gene expression correlates with crucial functional states in COAD, including \"angiogenesis, apoptosis, differentiation, hypoxia, inflammation, and metastasis.\" Additional in vitro experiments revealed that CDCA2 and CDCA3 knockdown in SW480 and SW629 cells significantly reduced cell proliferation and colony formation while enhancing cell migration.

TIMER and TISIDB databases investigated the correlation between ACSLs expression and immune infiltration and checkpoint genes. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were computed, and net reclassification index and integrated discrimination improvement were estimated to evaluate the predictive capability of the prognosis model.

High ACSL1 (HR\u2009=\u20092.352, 95%CI: 1.647-3.359, P\u2009=\u20099.00E-06), ACSL3 (HR\u2009=\u20092.367, 95%CI: 1.547-3.624, P\u2009=\u20092.92E-04) and ACSL5 (HR\u2009=\u20092.329, 95%CI: 1.611-3.367, P\u2009=\u20092.80E-05) expression correlated with poor prognosis, while increased ACSL6 (HR\u2009=\u20090.449, 95%CI: 0.290-0.696, P\u2009=\u20091.02E-03) expression related to better survival rates. Furthermore, these associations were also confirmed in the validation datasets and our external cohort. Negative correlation between ACSL1 and ACSL3 gene expression and methylation was found. Functional enrichment analyses highlighted the roles of ACSL1 and ACSL5 in glioma mechanisms and immune function, with significant associations between somatic CNVs and immune cell infiltration. ACSL1 and ACSL5 exhibit prognostic significance in gliomas and influence tumor immunity and immune cell migration, providing valuable insights into LGG prognosis and therapeutic targets.",

          "abstract": "Proliferation-associated protein 2G4 (PA2G4), also known as ErbB3-binding protein 1 (EBP1), is an evolutionarily conserved, ubiquitously expressed, multifunctional factor in health and disease. In recent decades, its role as a sophisticated regulator in a broad range of biological processes has drawn widespread attention from researchers. We introduce the molecular structure, functional modules, and post-translational modifications of PA2G4. We further elaborate on its role and function in immune microenvironment modulation, cell growth, neural homeostasis and embryonic development. In particular, we summarize its relevance to tumorigenesis and cancer progression and describe its molecular mechanisms in regulating the hallmarks of cancers. This review aims to provide a comprehensive blueprint of PA2G4 functions and to inspire further basic and translational studies. Owing to its versatile domains and motifs, PA2G4 regulates a variety of molecular processes, including transcription, translation, proteostasis and epigenetic modulation, suggesting its critical roles in maintaining homeostasis. There are two isoforms of the PA2G4 protein: PA2G4-p42 and PA2G4-p48. While both isoforms regulate cellular activities, they often exert distinct or even contradictory effects. Dysfunction and aberrant expression of PA2G4 isoforms lead to the occurrence and progression of various diseases, indicating their role as predictive markers or therapeutic targets.",

          "abstract": "There has been significant progress in understanding the molecular landscape of pediatric differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) over the past 2 decades. Classification of pediatric DFC into 3 tiers, RAS-like mutant, BRAF mutant, and kinase fusions, accurately reflects an increasing risk for invasive behavior, including regional and distant metastasis. In clinical practice, somatic oncogene testing for nodules with indeterminate cytology per the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology provides objective data to optimize surgical planning. In addition, knowledge of the somatic oncogene for widely invasive carcinomas allows for incorporation of oncogene-specific inhibitory therapy both in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting. In the present review, we review the risk factors, clinical presentation, and evaluation of pediatric DTC, highlighting the correlation among ultrasound features, cytology, and oncogenic driver of the tumor. We subsequently propose an integrated, multimodal approach that can be used to improve diagnostic accuracy and reliability for preoperative planning as well as identify and discuss which pediatric patients may benefit from systemic oral targeted therapy.",

          "abstract": "The homeobox (HOX) genes especially for HOXA cluster play crucial roles in leukemogenesis. HOXA overexpression caused by genetic alterations, such as KMT2A rearrangements, NUP98- fusions and FLT3-ITD mutations, is frequently identified in AML. However, very few studies determined the DNA methylation-mediated epigenetic regulation of the HOXA cluster genes in AML. We systematically first screened the prognostic value of HOXA cluster genes methylation in AML from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. Afterwards, the candidate prognosis-related gene HOXA9 were selected for clinical relevance analysis and were further validated in another independent cohort from our research center. The methylation of HOXA9, among HOXA cluster genes, negatively correlated with adverse prognosis and expression were screened and identified in AML among TCGA datasets. Clinically, HOXA9 hypomethylation was positively correlated with specific subtypes of AML, such as French-American-British (FAB)-M5/M7, normal karyotype and FLT3, NPM1 and DNMT3A mutation, whereas negatively associated with FAB-M3, t(15;17), t(8;21) and t(16;16). Importantly, AML patients with HOXA9 hypomethylation may profit from transplantation, whereas AML patients with HOXA9 hypermethylation could not, suggesting that HOXA9 methylation may be used to guide therapeutic selection between transplantation and chemotherapy. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated the association of HOXA9 expression with diverse leukemia-related genes (HOXAs, SOSTDC1, MEG3, miR-10a, miR-381 and miR-193b) and signaling pathways (PI3K-Akt signaling) in AML. Subsequently, we further validate the hypomethylation pattern of HOXA9 in AML patients and the epigenetic regulation of HOXA9 methylation in AML cell-lines. HOXA9 methylation linked to HOXA9 expression correlates with diverse genetic abnormalities of AML, such as normal karyotype, t(15;17), t(8;21), t(16;16) and FLT3, NPM1 and DNMT3A mutations. Moreover, HOXA9 hypomethylation may be associated with adverse prognosis, and may guide treatment choice in AML.",

In this study, we employed an integrative multi-omics approach, including targeted proteomics, transcriptomics, genomics, and DNA methylation profiling, to investigate the response of a representative panel of GBM patient-derived cancer stem cells (CSCs) to astrocytic differentiation and RT and TMZ treatments. Differentiated CSC progenies retained the expression of key stemness genes and survival pathways, while activating the BMP-Smad signaling pathway and upregulating extracellular matrix components. This was associated with increased resistance to TMZ, though not to RT, across all models. We identified TP53 status as a critical determinant of transcriptional response to both RT and TMZ, which was also modulated by the differentiation state and treatment modality in wildtype (wt) p53 GBM cells. Both mutant and wt p53 models exhibited significant activation of the DNA-damage associated interferon (IFN) response in CSCs and differentiated cells, implicating this pathway in the GBM response to therapy. We observed that activation of NF-\u03baB was positively correlated with the levels of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) protein, a direct DNA repair enzyme leading to TMZ resistance, regardless of MGMT promoter methylation status, further supporting the clinical potential for inhibition of NF-kB signaling in GBM treatment. Our integrative analysis of the impact of GBM cell developmental states, in the context of genomic and molecular diversity of patient-derived models, provides valuable insights for pre-clinical studies aimed at optimizing treatment strategies.",

This study analyzed 696 breast cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Text Information Extraction System (TIES) database, with complete information available for staging according to both the AJCC seventh- and eighth-edition criteria. The study indicated an increase in the number of patients classified as stage I in the eighth edition compared with the seventh edition, particularly in hormone-positive breast cancers. Furthermore, the eighth edition demonstrated improved discrimination in overall survival between stages I and II cancers. The eighth edition was able to distinguish significant differences in cell proliferation, intratumor heterogeneity, homologous recombination deficiency, and neoantigen load between stages I and II cancers. Moreover, the eighth edition more clearly differentiated immune cell infiltration between stages II and I cancer than the seventh edition. Finally, immune activity and gene expression of immune checkpoints such as PDCD1, PDL1, CTLA4, LAG3, TIGIT, and IDO1 and 2 showed a more pronounced difference between stages I and II cancers in the eighth edition than in the seventh edition.

Given the clinical efficacy of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) in solid tumor treatment, we aimed to identify a novel ADC target and suitable payload for GEJ-targeted therapy. In this study, we conducted bioinformatic analyses of multi-omics data, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics, to identify CD66c as a promising ADC target for GEJ cancer. We then engineered a CD66c-directed antibody-drug conjugate (CD66c-DXd) incorporating a GGFG linker. The preclinical efficacy of CD66c-DXd was determined in multi GEJ xenograft models. Proteomic analyses of 103 cases of GEJ cancer revealed that CD66c expression was significantly higher in tumoral tissues compared to normal tissues. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses identified deruxtecan (DXd) as a potentially potent payload for ADCs targeting GEJ cancer. Furthermore, high CD66c expression in GEJ was associated with a significantly lower proportion of plasma cells. The drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of CD66c-DXd was determined to be 3.6. CD66c-DXd effectively and selectively ablated multiple human GEJ cell lines (OE-19, OE33 and SK-GT-4) without affecting non-malignant cells (GES-1) in vitro. Eventually, CD66c-DXd mediated potent and durable tumor regression in vivo with excellent safety profiles. This preclinical study provides a strong rationale for the further development of CD66c-DXd as promising therapeutic candidates to treat advanced GEJ cancer. Additionally, the study demonstrates the robustness of the multi-omics data in identifying novel potential ADC targets and payloads.",

This transcription factor is a member of the family of transcription factors and highly expressed in a variety of cancer types. As of now, there are few reports on the relationship between the expression of SREBF1 and colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). Hence, this study utilizes databases and a range of experiments to explore the relationship between the expression of SREBF1 and tumor immune infiltration, as well as the occurrence and development of tumors. The expression of SREBF1 in pan-cancers was retrieved through databases such as TIMER, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), and UALCAN. The expression of SREBF1 in HCT-116 and SW480 cells was detected using western blot. Furthermore, we also found that knockdown SREBF1 can inhibit the proliferation and migration of COAD cells. The correlation between SREBF1 and autophagy in COAD cells was detected using acridine orange (AO) staining, western blot, and immunofluorescence (IF). The databases of TIMER, GEPIA and UALCAN revealed that SREBF1 is overexpressed in pan-cancer tissues, and closely associated with the prognosis of the patients with cancer. Further immunohistochemical staining showed that SREBF1 was overexpressed in COAD, and closely related to the clinical stage and lymph node metastasis. Western blot revealed that SREBF1 was significantly expressed in both HCT-116 and SW480 COAD cells; knockdown of SREBF1 could inhibit the proliferation, DNA replication, and migration of COAD cells. The AO staining, western blot, and IF experiments also showed that silencing SREBF1 could promote the autophagy of COAD cell. Meanwhile, the TIMER database indicates a significant positive correlation between the presence of immune cells in COAD and variations in copy number alteration of SREBF1. SREBF1 might serve as a potential prognostic marker for COAD and be associated with immune cell infiltration.",

To validate these findings, DDIT4 protein expression levels and their prognostic significance were examined in tissue microarrays from glioma patients using immunohistochemistry in clinical samples. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that DDIT4 overexpression in glioma tumors and its high mRNA expression levels are associated with poor outcomes, likely through mTOR signaling. At the protein level, positive nuclear DDIT4 expression was linked to higher histological grades and temozolomide treatment. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that positive nuclear DDIT4 expression is a significant predictor of poor disease-specific survival (DSS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Additionally, nuclear DDIT4 expression was identified as an independent prognostic factor for DSS.

Here we analysed large-scale CRISPR knockout screening data from the Cancer Dependency Map and identified a new synthetic lethal target, PELO, for two independent molecular subtypes of cancer: biallelic deletion of chromosomal region 9p21.3 or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H). In 9p21.3-deleted cancers, PELO dependency emerges from biallelic deletion of the 9p21.3 gene FOCAD, a stabilizer of the superkiller complex (SKIc). In MSI-H cancers, PELO is required owing to MSI-H-associated mutations in TTC37\u00a0(also known as\u00a0SKIC3), a critical component of the SKIc. We show that both cancer subtypes converge to destabilize the SKIc, which extracts mRNA from stalled ribosomes. In SKIc-deficient cells, PELO depletion induces the unfolded protein response, a stress response to accumulation of misfolded or unfolded nascent polypeptides. Together, our findings indicate PELO as a promising therapeutic target for a large patient population with cancers characterized as MSI-H with deleterious TTC37 mutations or with biallelic 9p21.3 deletions involving FOCAD.",

          "abstract": "Metastasis accounts for the overwhelming majority of cancer deaths. In prostate cancer and many other solid tumors, progression to metastasis is associated with drastically reduced survival outcomes, yet the mechanisms behind this progression remain largely unknown. ATPase family AAA domain containing 2 (ATAD2) is an epigenetic reader of acetylated histones that is overexpressed in multiple cancer types and usually associated with poor patient outcomes. However, the functional role of ATAD2 in cancer progression and metastasis has been relatively understudied. Here, we employ genetically engineered mouse models of prostate cancer bone metastasis, as well as multiple independent human cohorts, to show that ATAD2 is highly enriched in bone metastasis compared with primary tumors and significantly associated with the development of metastasis. We show that ATAD2 expression is associated with MYC pathway activation in patient datasets and that, at least in a subset of tumors, MYC and ATAD2 can regulate each other's expression. Using functional studies on mouse bone metastatic cell lines and innovative organ-on-a-chip bone invasion assays, we establish a functional role for ATAD2 inhibition in reducing prostate cancer metastasis and growth in bone. Implications: Our study highlights ATAD2 as a driver of prostate cancer progression and metastasis and suggests it may constitute a promising novel therapeutic target.",

We developed a framework to count cell divisions with DNA replication-related mutations in polyguanine homopolymers. Analyzing 505 samples from 37 patients, we studied the milestones of colorectal cancer evolution. Primary tumors diversify at ~250 divisions from the founder cell, while distant metastasis divergence occurs significantly later, at ~500 divisions. Notably, distant but not lymph node metastases originate from primary tumor regions that have undergone surplus divisions, tying subclonal expansion to metastatic capacity. Then, we analyzed a cohort of 73 multifocal lung cancers and showed that the cell division burden of the tumors' common ancestor distinguishes independent primary tumors from intrapulmonary metastases and correlates with patient survival. In lung cancer too, metastatic capacity is tied to more extensive proliferation. The cell division history of human cancers is easily accessible using our simple framework and contains valuable biological and clinical information.",

The Myc oncogene is a paradigm of an exquisitely regulated oncogene and a driver of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Here we use a CRISPR interference screen in PDAC cells to identify activators of selective MYC translation. The top hit, the RNA-binding protein RBM42, is highly expressed in PDAC and predicts poor survival. We show that RBM42 binds and selectively regulates the translation of MYC and a precise suite of pro-oncogenic transcripts, including JUN and EGFR. Mechanistically, we find that RBM42 binds and remodels the MYC 5' untranslated region structure, facilitating the formation of the translation pre-initiation complex. Importantly, RBM42 is necessary for PDAC tumorigenesis in a Myc-dependent manner in vivo. This work transforms the understanding of the translational code in cancer and illuminates therapeutic openings to target the expression of oncogenes.",

The role of CDC6 in cancer was analyzed using multiple web platforms and software, including R, cBioPortal, UALCAN, SangerBox and others. Finally, CCK-8, EdU assays and Transwell assays were used to verify the effects of CDC6 knockdown on HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CDC6 expression was upregulated in most cancers and was associated with poorer prognosis. RNA methylation may play an important role in CDC6 epigenetic modification. CDC6 was significantly positively associated with CD4+ Th2 cells and MDSC in a variety of tumors. Furthermore, immunomodulatory genes are strongly associated with CDC6 expression in most tumor types. CDC6 has higher predictive value than B. Clonality and TMB, and its expression is significantly positively correlated with TMB/MSI and DNAss/RNAss, and is closely related to cell cycle events. Down-regulation of CDC6 can inhibit proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells. CDC6 is associated with the occurrence and progression of multiple cancer types by regulating the cell cycle.

Systems biologists aim to understand such complexity at a quantitative level. However, these ambitious efforts are often limited by access to a variety of high-density intra-, extra- and multi-cellular measurements resolved in time and space and across a variety of perturbations. The advent of automation, OMICs and single-cell technologies now allows high dimensional multi-modal data acquisition from the same biological samples multiplexed at scale (multi-OMICs). As a result, systems biologists -theoretically- have access to more data than ever. However, the mathematical frameworks and computational tools needed to analyze and interpret such data are often still nascent, limiting the biological insights that can be obtained without years of computational method development and validation. More pressingly, much of the data sits in silos in formats that are incomprehensible to other scientists or machines limiting its value to the vaster scientific community, especially the computational biologists tasked with analyzing these vast amounts of data in more nuanced ways. With the rapid development and increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for the life sciences, improving how biologic data is organized and shared is more pressing than ever for scientific progress. Here, we outline a practical approach to multi-modal data management and FAIR sharing, which are in line with the latest US and EU funders' data sharing policies.

We report that mutations that convert histone H3 amino acid 50 from a glutamate to a lysine (H3E50K) support an oncogenic phenotype. Expression of H3E50K is sufficient to transform human cells as evidenced by an increase in cell migration and invasion, and an increase in proliferation and clonogenicity. H3E50K also increases the invasive phenotype in the context of co-occurring <i>BRAF</i> mutations, which are present in patient tumors characterized by H3E50K. H3E50 lies on the globular domain surface in a region that contacts H4 within the nucleosome. We find that H3E50K selectively increases chromatin accessibility and perturbs proximal H3 post-translational modifications including H3K27me3; together these changes to chromatin dynamics dysregulate gene expression to support the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Functional studies using <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> reveal that, while yeast cells that express H3E50K as the sole copy of histone H3 show sensitivity to cellular stressors, including caffeine, H3E50K cells display some genetic interactions that are distinct from the characterized H3K36M oncohistone yeast model.

          "abstract": "A hypoxic metabolism environment in the tumors is often associated with poor prognostic events such as tumor progression and treatment resistance. In gastric cancer, the mechanism of how hypoxia metabolism affects the tumor microenvironment and immunotherapy efficacy remains to be elucidated. We used the bulk-mapping method to analyze the signatures correlated with the response of immunotherapy in the single-cell dataset. Cellular, pathway, and gene were systematically analyzed in both single-cell and bulk validation datasets. The most significant cell proportion difference between the response and non-response groups was in endothelial cells, which represent the malignant cells. VWF was specifically overexpressed in endothelial cells and was the hub gene of differential genes. EPAS1 was a VWF trans-regulated gene and highly positively correlated with VWF in expression. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that siVWF reduced the expression of VWF, EPAS1, and HIF1A, as well as the synthesis of lactate and adenosine which are indicators of hypoxic metabolism. These results suggest that the overexpression of core malign endothelial genes such as VWF drives hypoxic metabolism in tumors and creates an immunosuppressive environment that reduces the efficacy of immunotherapy. The adverse prognosis of the hypoxia signature was validated in the bulk cohort and significance was further enhanced after selecting core genes and combined survival weight scoring. In summary, high expression of the malignant endothelial cell driver genes VWF and EPAS1 enhances hypoxic metabolism, and malignant cell-immune cell interactions suppress the immune response. Therefore, the two core genes of hypoxic metabolism might represent potential therapeutic and predicting biomarkers for immunotherapy of gastric cancer in the future.",

In this study, we investigated the expression profiles and clinical implications of MAP3K genes in GC using in silico and in vitro experiments. Utilizing RT-qPCR analysis, we observed significant up-regulation of MAP3K1, MAP3K4, MAP3K5, MAP3K6, MAP3K7, MAP3K8, MAP3K9, and MAP3K10 in GC cell lines, while MAP3K2, MAP3K3, MAP3K11, MAP3K12, MAP3K13, MAP3K14, and MAP3K15 exhibited down-regulation. Prognostic evaluation revealed that elevated expression of MAP3K1, MAP3K4, MAP3K7, MAP3K8, MAP3K9, and MAP3K10 was associated with shorter overall survival (OS), emphasizing their clinical significance. Furthermore, the diagnostic potential was demonstrated through robust Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, indicating the strong discriminatory power of these genes in distinguishing GC patients. Proteomic analysis further confirmed the higher expression of MAP3K1, MAP3K4, MAP3K7, MAP3K8, MAP3K9, and MAP3K10 genes in GC. Methylation profiling further supported the idea that promoter hypomethylation of MAP3K1, MAP3K4, MAP3K7, MAP3K8, MAP3K9, and MAP3K10 genes was associated with their up-regulation. Single-cell functional analysis elucidated the involvement of MAP3K genes in shaping the tumor microenvironment. miRNA-mRNA network analysis revealed intricate regulatory mechanisms, with hsa-mir-200b-3p emerging as a key regulator. Finally, the MAP3K1 knockdown has shown significant impacts on the cellular behavior of the BGC823 cells.

To address this challenge, researchers have developed feature selection methods to enhance performance, reduce overfitting, and ensure resource efficiency. However, applying feature selection models to survival analysis, particularly in clinical datasets characterized by substantial censoring and limited sample sizes, introduces unique challenges. We propose a robust ensemble feature selection approach integrated with group Lasso to identify compelling features and evaluate its performance in predicting survival outcomes. Our approach consistently outperforms established models across various criteria through extensive simulations, demonstrating low false discovery rates, high sensitivity, and high stability. Furthermore, we applied the approach to a colorectal cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas, showcasing its effectiveness by generating a composite score based on the selected genes to correctly distinguish different subtypes of the patients. In summary, our proposed approach excels in selecting impactful features from high-dimensional data, yielding better outcomes compared to contemporary state-of-the-art models.",

Store operated calcium entry (SOCE) is a major intracellular signaling module, wherein calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum triggers transmembrane STIM1 proteins to conformationally shift and oligomerize to prompt calcium influx from the extracellular environment. STIM1 senses ER calcium concentrations with its canonical EF-hand domain, and missense variants can dysregulate SOCE and cause Tubular Aggregate Myopathy, Stormorken Syndrome or immunodeficiency. Few STIM1 EF-hand variants are characterized, obscuring how STIM1 sequence controls its function, and hampering clinical interpretation of STIM1 variants observed in patients. We leveraged fitness costs caused by overexpression of STIM1 variants in cultured human cells to functionally characterize 706 of the 720 possible single amino acid variants of the STIM1 canonical EF-hand. The calcium-coordinating EF-hand residues exhibited varying mutational patterns. The trailing helix possessed a core of immutable residues, even depleting during library propagation in bacteria, implicating residues normally restraining STIM1 aggregation. The leading helix only exhibited toxicity in cells with endogenous STIM1, implicating a multimerization-dependent STIM1 regulatory module. No cytotoxic STIM1 variants were observed in healthy human populations. Some disease-associated variants had low scores, but most pathogenic variants were not overtly cytotoxic in our assay. We demonstrate that orthogonal measurements for STIM1 oligomerization, cytoplasmic calcium influx, and cellular stress complement the cytotoxicity phenotypes to enhance variant understanding. Collectively, these data reveal the complex molecular roles embedded in the STIM1 canonical EF-hand sequence for its function in promoting calcium signaling through SOCE.",

However, a detailed evaluation of the expression patterns and the prognostic value of markers relevant for endometrial cancer is lacking. As organoid models are suggested to be enriched in cancer stem cells, such models may prove valuable to define tissue-specific cancer stem cells. To address this, imaging mass cytometry and multiplex single-cell analyses were performed on an endometrial cancer patient series including both tumor biopsies and corresponding patient-derived organoids. An antibody panel focused on cancer stem cell markers was used to identify cancer stem cell phenotypes. Over 70% of epithelial cells in the tumor biopsies expressed at least one putative cancer stem cell marker. We identified distinct cancer cell phenotypes with heterogeneous expression within individual patients and between patient samples. Few differences in the distribution of cancer cell phenotypes were observed between tumor biopsies and corresponding organoids. Cells expressing aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) were more prevalent in high-grade tumors, while expression of CD44 was more prevalent in grade 1 tumors. Spatial analysis revealed significantly less interaction between ALDH1- and CD44-expressing cells. Gene expression data was used to further investigate selected markers.

MARCH8 expression showed cancer-specific dysregulation and was associated with the prognosis of patients in various cancers. MARCH8 was related to the tumor microenvironment and participated in tumor immune regulation. Furthermore, low expression of MARCH8 was associated with poor prognosis and might serve as an independent prognostic biomarker for NSCLC patients.

Stark racial disparities are present in EC outcomes in which Black women have significantly higher EC-related mortality than White women. The social and biologic factors that contribute to these disparities are complex and may include racial differences in epigenetic landscapes. To investigate race-specific epigenetic differences in EC tumor characteristics and outcomes, we utilized the most recent data within the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Genome-wide CpG methylation data for more than 850 000 CpG sites were analyzed across 245 tumor samples, including 52 from Black women and 181 from White women. Race-adjusted and race-stratified associations among CpG methylation in ECs and molecular subtypes and disease-free survival were examined. Race-specific analysis identified subtype-associated CpGs within 9572 genes in tumors from White women and only 10 genes in tumors that were from Black women. Race-specific analyses also identified survival-associated CpGs with 1119 unique genes identified in tumors from White women and none identified in tumors from Black women. Genes identified with differential methylation among subtypes included those involved in oxidative stress (HIF3A), and DNA repair (MLH1). Data from a replication cohort highlighted genes overlapping with those identified within the TCGA, such as G Protein Subunit Beta 1 (GNB1), involved in G-protein signaling, and Interleukin 37 (IL37), involved in cytokine signaling. Identification of these racial differences in EC tumor epigenetic landscapes and associated changes in gene expression may provide insight into strategies to improve outcomes and reduce disparities.",

Although all three RAF isoforms share a conserved RAS binding domain and bind to GTP-loaded RAS, only ARAF uniquely enhances RAS activity. Here we uncovered the molecular basis of ARAF in regulating RAS activation. The disordered N-terminal sequence of ARAF drives self-assembly, forming ARAF-RAS condensates tethered to the plasma membrane. These structures concentrate active RAS locally, impeding NF1-mediated negative regulation of RAS, thereby fostering receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-triggered RAS activation. In RAS-mutant tumors, loss of the ARAF N terminus sensitizes tumor cells to pan-RAF inhibition. In hormone-sensitive cancers, increased ARAF condensates drive endocrine therapy resistance, whereas ARAF depletion reverses RTK-dependent resistance. Our findings delineate ARAF-RAS protein condensates as distinct subcellular structures sustaining RAS activity and facilitating oncogenic RAS signaling. Targeting ARAF-RAS condensation may offer a strategy to overcome drug resistance in both wild-type and mutant ARAF-mediated scenarios.",

HER2 positive rates and hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival (OS) were combined using Metaprop. The prevalence of HER2\u2009+\u2009MBC was 10.0% (95% CI: 8.0-13.0%).

In this study, we demonstrated that the RNA-regulatory functions of NOC1 are conserved in vertebrates, where the reduction of the CEBPZ homolog of NOC1 leads to the accumulation of unprocessed 45S pre-rRNA, a reduction in protein synthesis, and inhibition of cell growth. Gene Ontology and bioinformatic analyses of CEBPZ, NOC2L, and NOC3L in tumors highlight a significant correlation between their expression and processes that regulate rRNA processing and ribosomal maturation. Moreover, comparative analysis of TCGA datasets from tumor databases revealed that CEBPZ, NOC2L, and NOC3L exhibit contrasting expression patterns across tumor types. This context-dependent behavior suggests that overexpression of these proteins may promote tumor growth, whereas reduced expression could exert tumor-suppressive effects, underscoring their complex and unexpected regulatory roles in cancer.",

However, the expression profiles, prognostic relevance, and diagnostic value of its subunits across cancers remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the clinical relevance of Arp2/3 complex subunits, particularly ARPC1A, in pan-cancer, and to further analyze the potential biological mechanisms of ARPC1A, as well as its association with immune infiltration and chemotherapy drug sensitivity. To explore the differential expression of Arp2/3 complex subunits and their clinical relevance across cancers, we analyzed data from TCGA and GTEx databases. The relationship between ARPC1A and immune infiltration, as well as its interactions with functional proteins, was examined using the TCPA and TIMER2.0 databases. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify ARPC1A-associated signaling pathways. Chemotherapy drug sensitivity correlated with ARPC1A expression was assessed using CellMiner, GDSC, and CTRP databases. The effect of ARPC1A on c-Myc expression was validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blot. Finally, the biological role of ARPC1A in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells was further validated using CCK-8, EdU incorporation, colony formation, and Transwell assays. The Arp2/3 complex subunits, particularly ARPC1A, are frequently overexpressed in a majority of cancers, correlating with poor prognostic outcomes and demonstrating significant diagnostic utility. Copy number variations may play a role in the dysregulation of Arp2/3 complex subunit expression. The small molecule X4.5.dianilinophthalimide has shown promise as a targeted therapeutic agent in a pan-cancer context. Functional predictions indicate that ARPC1A is implicated in oxidative phosphorylation pathways and cell proliferation-related signaling pathways, including those mediated by MYC, with ASNS potentially acting as an upstream regulator. Furthermore, ARPC1A has been implicated in the resistance to chemotherapy drugs, including gefitinib. <i>In vitro</i> experiments corroborate that ARPC1A may enhance malignant phenotypes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells through the regulation of c-Myc expression.

Cox and logistic regression analyses were also conducted. Functional assays, including wound healing, CCK-8, and Transwell migration assays, were employed to investigate the role of the THRB gene. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that low THRB expression was significantly associated with reduced overall survival (OS), 5-year OS and disease-specific survival (DSS) in HCC patients (<i>P</i> < 0.05), while no significant association was found with THRA expression. Both Cox regression and logistic regression identified low THRB expression as an independent risk factor for HCC. THRB expression was significantly downregulated in tumor tissues compared to non-tumorous tissues in 3 GEO datasets and the TCGA profile. Functional assays confirmed that THRB inhibited HCC cell proliferation and migration.

Previous research has established a significant connection between NTN1 and nervous system development. In recent years, mounting evidence indicates that NTN1 also plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. For instance, inhibiting Netrin-1 has been shown to suppress tumor growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) characteristics in endometrial cancer. To further elucidate the influence of genes on tumors, we utilized a variety of machine learning techniques and found that NTN1 is strongly linked to multiple cancer types, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic target. This study aimed to elucidate the role of NTN1 in pan-cancer using multi-omics data and explore its potential as a prognostic biomarker in SKCM. Analysis of the TCGA, GTEx, and UALCAN databases revealed significant differences in NTN1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Prognostic value was evaluated through univariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier methods. Mutation and methylation analyses were conducted using the cBioPortal and SMART databases. We identified genes interacting with and correlated to NTN1 through STRING and GEPIA2, respectively. Subsequently, we performed GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. The results suggested that NTN1 might be involved in crucial biological processes and pathways related to cancer development and progression, including cell adhesion, axon guidance, immune response, and various signaling pathways. We then explored the correlation between NTN1 and immune infiltration as well as immunotherapy using the ESTIMATE package, TIMER2.0, TISIDB, TIDE, TIMSO, and TCIA. The relationship between NTN1 and tumor heterogeneity, stemness, DNA methyltransferases, and MMR genes was also examined. Lastly, we constructed a nomogram based on NTN1 in SKCM and investigated its association with drug sensitivity. NTN1 expression was significantly associated with tumor immune infiltration, molecular subtypes, and clinicopathological features in various cancers. Genetic analysis revealed that Deep deletions were the most common type of NTN1 alteration. Additionally, a positive correlation was observed between NTN1 CNAs and its expression levels. In most cancers, NTN1 showed positive correlations with immune and stromal scores, as well as with specific immune cell populations. Its predictive value for immunotherapy response was comparable to that of tumor mutational burden. Furthermore, NTN1 exhibited positive correlations with tumor heterogeneity, stemness, DNA methyltransferase genes, and MMR genes. In SKCM, NTN1 was identified as an independent risk factor and demonstrated potential associations with multiple drugs. NTN1 exhibits substantial clinical utility as a prognostic marker and indicator of immune response across various tumor types. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into its potential implications in pan-cancer research.",

This study investigated the expression of B7-H3 across various solid tumors and developed novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting B7-H3 for CAR T cell therapy. Expression of B7-H3 across various solid tumors was evaluated using RNA-seq data from TCGA, TARGET, and GTEx datasets and by flow cytometry staining. B7-H3-specific mAbs were developed by immunizing mice with human B7-H3, screening with ELISA, and analyzing kinetics with surface plasmon resonance. These mAbs were used to create second-generation CAR constructs, which were evaluated in vitro and in vivo for their antitumor function. We identified four mAb clones from immunized mice, with three demonstrating high specificity and affinity. The second-generation B7-H3 CAR T cells derived from these mAbs exhibited robust cytotoxicity against B7-H3-positive targets and successfully infiltrated and eliminated tumor spheroids in vitro. In a xenograft mouse model of glioblastoma, these CAR T cells, particularly those derived from clone A2H4, eradicated the primary tumor, and effectively controlled rechallenge tumor, resulting in prolonged survival of the xenograft mice. In vivo T cell trafficking revealed high accumulation and persistence of A2H4-derived CAR T cells at the tumor site. Our results provide novel B7-H3-targeted CAR T cells with high efficacy, paving the way for clinical translation of solid tumor treatment.",

          "abstract": "Site-directed mutagenesis is a fundamental tool indispensable for protein and plasmid engineering. An important technological question is how to achieve the ideal efficiency of 100%. Based on complementary primer pairs, the QuickChange method has been widely used, but it requires significant improvements due to its low efficiency and frequent unwanted mutations. An alternative and innovative strategy is to utilize primer pairs with 3'-overhangs, but this approach has not been fully developed. As the first step toward reaching the efficiency of 100%, we have optimized this approach systematically (such as use of newly designed short primers, test of different Pfu DNA polymerases, and modification of PCR parameters) and evaluated the resulting method extensively with >100 mutations on 12 mammalian expression vectors, ranging from 7.0 to 13.4 kb in size and encoding ten epigenetic regulators linked to cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. We have also tested the new method with two expression vectors for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Compared to the QuickChange method, the success rate has increased substantially, with an average efficiency of \u223c50%, with some at or close to 100%, and requiring much less time for engineering various mutations. Therefore, we have developed a new site-directed mutagenesis method for efficient and economical generation of various mutations. Notably, the method failed with a human KAT2B expression plasmid that possesses extremely GC-rich sequences. Thus, this study also sheds light on how to improve the method for developing ideal mutagenesis methods with the efficiency of \u223c100% for a wide spectrum of plasmids.",

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters function as drug transporters and have been touted to be the main culprits in developing resistance to xenobiotic drugs in GBM. <b>Methods</b>: This review systematically analyzed the efficacy of ABC transporters against various anticancer drugs from 16 studies identified from five databases (PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, and ScienceDirect). <b>Results</b>: Inhibition of ABC transporters, especially ABCB1, improved drug efficacies. Staple GBM phenotypes, such as GBM stem cells and increased activation of the PI3K/Akt/NF-\u03baB pathway, have been implicated in the expression of several ABC transporters. Using the datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus, we found upregulated ABC transporters that either negatively impacted survival in univariate analyses (ABCA1, ABCA13, ABCB9, ABCD4) or were independent negative prognosis factors for patients with GBM (ABCA13, ABCB9). Our multivariate analysis further demonstrated three ABC transporters, ABCA13 (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 1.31, <i>p</i> = 0.017), ABCB9 (HR = 1.26, <i>p</i> = 0.03), and ABCB5 (HR = 0.77, <i>p</i> = 0.016), with the administration of alkylating agents (HR = 0.41, <i>p</i> < 0.001), were independent negative prognosis factors for patients with GBM. Conclusions: These findings reinforce the important role played by ABC transporters, particularly by ABCA13, ABCB9, and ABCB1, which could be potential targets that warrant further evaluations for alternate strategies to augment the effects of existing alkylating agents and xenobiotic drugs.",

Studies have not yet been performed to determine what vulnerability may be created in cancer cells with low metallothionein expression. Here, a screen of FDA-approved cancer small molecule drugs for those best targeting low metallothionein ovarian cancer was completed. Screening methods were tested and compared using vehicle-treated negative controls and cadmium chloride, a positive control for cell loss selective for low metallothionein cells. CAOV3 cells, which are unique in their expression of only two metallothionein isoforms, were used, with or without shRNA knockdown of the predominantly expressed <i>MT2A</i> gene. A library of FDA-approved molecules was then screened. The optimal assay utilized Hoechst 33342 nuclear staining and mechanized fluorescent microscope counting of cell content. Encorafenib, an RAF inhibitor, was identified as the most selective for enhanced cytotoxicity in <i>MT2A</i> knockdown cells compared to scrambled controls. The nuclear stain Hoechst 33342, assessed by fluorescence microscopy, provides a low variance, moderate throughput platform for cancer cell loss screens.

          "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) represents approximately 3% of all gastrointestinal cancers and is a highly heterogeneous and aggressive malignancy originating from the epithelial cells of the biliary tree. CCA is classified by anatomical location into intrahepatic (iCCA), extrahepatic (eCCA), gallbladder cancer (GBC), and ampullary cancers. Although considered a rare tumor, CCA incidence has risen globally, particularly due to the increased diagnosis of iCCA. Genomic and immune profiling studies have revealed significant heterogeneity within CCA, leading to the identification of molecular subtypes and actionable genetic alterations in 40-60% of cases, particularly in iCCA. Among these, <i>FGFR2</i> rearrangements or fusions (7-15%) and <i>IDH1</i> mutations (10-20%) are common in iCCA, while <i>HER2</i> amplifications/overexpression are more frequent in eCCA and GBC. The tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME) of CCAs plays an active role in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease, creating a complex and plastic environment dominated by immune-suppressive populations. Among these, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a key component of the TIME and are associated with worse survival due to their role in maintaining a poorly immunogenic landscape through the deposition of stiff extracellular matrix and release of pro-tumor soluble factors. Improved understanding of CCA tumor biology has driven the development of novel treatments. Combination therapies of cisplatin and gemcitabine with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have replaced the decade-long standard doublet chemotherapy, becoming the new standard of care in patients with advanced CCA. However, the survival improvements remain modest prompting research into more effective ways to target the TIME of CCAs. As key mechanisms of immune evasion in CCA are uncovered, novel immune molecules emerge as potential therapeutic targets. Current studies are exploring strategies targeting multiple immune checkpoints, angiogenesis, and tumor-specific antigens that contribute to immune escape. Additionally, the success of ICIs in advanced CCA has led to interest in their application in earlier stages of the disease, such as in adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the immune biology of CCAs and examines how this knowledge has guided clinical drug development, with a focus on both approved and emergent treatment strategies.",

          "abstract": "The breakthrough discovery of novel biomarkers with prognostic and diagnostic value enables timely medical intervention for the survival of patients diagnosed with gastric cancer (GC). Typically, in studies focused on biomarker analysis, highly connected nodes (hubs) within the protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) are proposed as potential biomarkers. However, this study revealed an unexpected finding following the clustering of network nodes. Consequently, it is essential not to overlook weakly connected nodes (nonhubs) when determining suitable biomarkers from PPIN. In this study, several potential biomarkers for GC were proposed based on the findings from RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) datasets, along with differential gene expression (DGE) analysis, PPINs, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Considering the overall survival (OS) analysis and the evaluation of expression levels alongside statistical parameters of the PPIN cluster nodes, it is plausible to suggest that THY1, CDH17, TGIF1, and AEBP1, categorized as nonhub nodes, along with ITGA5, COL1A1, FN1, and MMP2, identified as hub nodes, possess characteristics that render them applicable as biomarkers for the GC. Additionally, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein-2 (IGFBP2), classified as a nonhub node, demonstrates a significant negative correlation with both groups within the same cluster. This observation underscores the conflicting findings regarding IGFBP2 in various cancer studies and enhances the potential of this gene to serve as a biomarker. The findings of the current study not only identified the hubs and nonhubs that may serve as potential biomarkers for GC but also revealed a PPIN cluster that includes both hubs and nonhubs in conjunction with IGFBP2, thereby enhancing the understanding of the complex behavior associated with IGFBP2.",

A pre-miRNA, such as pre-miR-1307, gives rise to several mature miRNA molecules with distinct functions. However, the impact of global deregulation of pre-miR-1307 and its individual mature miRNAs in breast cancer has not been\u00a0investigated in breast cancer, yet. Here, we found significant upregulation of three mature miRNA species derived from pre-miR-1307 in human breast cancer tissue. Surprisingly, the overexpression of pre-miR-1307 in breast cancer cell lines resulted in reduced xenograft growth and impaired angiogenesis. Mechanistically, overexpression of miR-1307-5p altered the secretome of breast cancer cells and reduced endothelial cell sprouting. Consistently, expression of miR-1307-5p was inversely correlated with endothelial cell fractions in human breast tumors pointing at an anti-angiogenic role of miR-1307-5p. Importantly, the arm usage of miR-1307 and other miRNAs was highly correlated, which suggests an undefined common regulatory mechanism. In summary, miR-1307-5p reduces angiogenesis in breast cancer, thereby antagonizing the oncogenic effects of miR-1307-3p. Our results emphasize the importance of future research on the regulation of miRNA arm selection in cancer. The underlying mechanisms might inspire new therapeutic strategies aimed at shifting the balance towards tumor-suppressive miRNA species.",

In vitro analysis suggests that in cell lines with diffuse cytoplasmic distribution of AHNAK2, there was colocalization of AHNAK2 with Cortactin in filipodia. This colocalization increased when cells were cultured on substrates such as Fibronectin and Collagen, as well as in hypoxia, and resulted in an augmented invasion of cancer cells.

          "abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the most prevalent form of lung cancer. The transition from adenocarcinoma <i>in situ</i> (AIS), and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) to invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) is not fully understood. Intratumoral microbiota may play a role in LUAD progression, but comprehensive stage-wise analysis is lacking. Tumor and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from patients with AIS/MIA or IAC were collected for next-generation sequencing to characterize microbial diversity and composition. DNA extraction involved lysing samples with nuclease and protease, followed by homogenization and elution. Sequencing libraries were prepared and sequenced on the Illumina platform. Whole exome sequencing was performed to identify somatic mutations and genetic variants. Bioinformatics analysis, including taxonomic annotation with Kraken2 and <i>de novo</i> assembly with MEGAHIT, was conducted to process metagenomic data. Correlation analysis was performed to link microbial species with mutated genes using custom R scripts. Metagenomic analysis revealed a distinct microbial profile in IAC compared to AIS/MIA, with increased abundance of <i>Bacteroidetes</i> and <i>Firmicutes</i> in the IAC group. <i>Bosea</i> sp. and <i>Microbacterium paludicola</i>, were less abundant in IAC, suggesting a potential protective role in early-stage disease. Conversely, Mycolicibacterium species were more prevalent in IAC, indicating a possible contribution to disease progression. Genetic sequencing identified PTPRZ1 strongly correlating with microbial composition, suggesting a mechanistic link between microbiota and genetic alterations in LUAD. This study characterizes microbial communities in various stages of LUAD, revealing links between microbiota and genetic mutations. The unique microbiota suggests its role in LUAD progression and as a therapeutic target.",

Herein, we first report that secernin 2 (SCRN2), an uncharacterized gene in human cancer, acts as a novel tumor suppressor in TNBC to inhibit cancer progression and enhance therapeutic sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. SCRN2 is downregulated in TNBC through chaperone-mediated autophagic degradation, and its downregulation is associated with poor patient prognosis. Moreover, SCRN2 impedes the proteasomal degradation of histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C) by recruiting Bcl2-associated athanogene 2 to block the interaction of KMT2C with E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase CHIP. Consistently, SCRN2 transcriptionally activates Bcl2-modifying factor by amplifying histone H3 monomethylation at lysine 4 at its enhancer, thereby inducing intrinsic apoptosis. Notably, KMT2C knockdown restores the impaired TNBC progression caused by SCRN2 overexpression both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, SCRN2 decreases the expression of key DNA repair-related genes and induces endogenous DNA damage, thus conferring therapeutic sensitivity of TNBC cells to PARP inhibition. \u00a0 Collectively, these findings identify SCRN2 as a novel suppressor of TNBC, reveal its mechanism of action, and highlight its potential role in TNBC therapy.",

This study identifies key woundhealing genes involved in UCEC and elucidates their roles through a comprehensive analysis. In silico and in vitro experiments. Seventy wound healing-associated genes were extracted from the Gene Ontology (GO) database, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database. CytoHubba analysis in Cytoscape identified six pivotal hub genes: CD44, FGF2, FGF10, KDM6A, FN1, and MMP2. These genes exhibited significantly lower expression in UCEC cell lines compared to normal controls, as confirmed by RT-qPCR. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated their potential as diagnostic biomarkers, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.94 to 1.00. Validation using TCGA datasets revealed consistent downregulation of these genes in UCEC samples, corroborated by immunohistochemical staining. Promoter methylation analysis showed significantly higher methylation levels in UCEC, correlating with decreased mRNA expression and poor survival outcomes. Genetic alteration analysis indicated frequent mutations in FN1 and KDM6A, although these did not significantly affect survival. Functional analysis using the CancerSEA database highlighted the involvement of these genes in critical cancer-related processes, including angiogenesis, apoptosis, and metastasis. Immune correlation studies revealed significant associations with immune inhibitor genes and distinct expression patterns across immune subtypes. Overexpression studies in UCEC cell lines demonstrated that CD44 and MMP2 reduce proliferative ability while enhancing migration and wound healing. Collectively, these findings underscore the crucial roles of CD44, FGF2, FGF10, KDM6A, FN1, and MMP2 in UCEC pathogenesis, highlighting their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in this malignancy.",

However, the genes that influence the prognosis and immunotherapy of lung cancer patients have not yet been thoroughly studied.

First, the TCGA database was used to screen key LUAD genes. Second, the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA2), University of ALabama at Birmingham CANcer (UALCAN), Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource (TIMER), Kaplan-Meier plotter, and cBioPortal databases, and a univariate Cox analysis combined with a random forest (RF) model were used to estimate gene expression, patient prognosis, and gene mutations, respectively. TIMER was also used to predict the immune function of the genes. A total of 2,138 up-regulated and 2,559 down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from TCGA-LUAD dataset. Next, four prognostic genes (i.e., <i>CENPH</i>, <i>SLC35F4</i>, <i>TESMIN</i>, and <i>TERT</i>) were identified as the key genes. The expression levels of all four genes were higher in LUAD tissues than those in the normal lung tissues, but only <i>CENPH</i> and <i>TESMIN</i> were correlated with poor overall survival (OS). The four genes were also found to be associated with immunoinfiltration. Of the four key genes identified, <i>CENPH</i> and <i>TESMIN</i> would not only contribute to the diagnosis and prognosis of LUAD but could also serve as potential immunotherapy targets for LUAD.",

This study is aimed to better understand the molecular and genetic differences among HER2- tumors stratified by quantitative levels of HER2. We analyzed the transcriptomic and genomic data from the Molecular Taxonomy of BC International Consortium (discovery cohort) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (independent validation cohort). HER2- BCs, including hormone receptor positive and triple negative, were divided into three subgroups based on ERBB2 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels: minimal, moderate and enhanced. We observed significant differences in mutational and transcriptional profiles across the subgroups. Tumors with enhanced ERBB2 mRNA expression had a higher prevalence of PIK3CA mutations and increased estrogen receptor signaling, while tumors with minimal ERBB2 mRNA expression displayed higher expression of proliferation and immune-related genes. We identified a distinct subgroup of BCs characterized by a large deletion of chromosome 17q12 (17q12del) with heterozygous loss of ERBB2, very low ERBB2 mRNA and HER2 protein expression. This subgroup was also enriched for heterozygous losses of TP53 and other tumor suppressor genes. Analysis of two large real-world cohorts of patients with HER2- metastatic BC (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute cohort n\u00a0= 1063 and Memorial Sloan Kettering MetTropism cohort n\u00a0= 1018) showed that patients with 17q12del and heterozygous loss of ERBB2 had poorer overall survival (OS). We identified a biologically and clinically distinct subgroup of BCs characterized by a 17q12del with a heterozygous loss of ERBB2 and low ERBB2 mRNA and HER2 protein expression. In two large real-world cohorts of patients with HER2- metastatic BC, this subgroup was associated with poor OS, highlighting its clinical significance.",

However, Kras mutation alone is insufficient to transform precancerous cells into metastatic PDAC. This study investigates how KRAS-mutated epithelial cells acquire the capacity to escape senescence or even immune clearance, thereby progressing to advanced PDAC. Single-cell RNA sequencing and analysis of primary PDAC tumors were conducted. Genetically engineered pancreas-specific Kras-mutated, dual specificity phosphatase-2 (Dusp2) knockout mouse models were established. Human and mouse primary pancreatic cancer cell lines were used for in vitro assessment of cancer characteristics. Tumor progression was studied via pancreas orthotopic and portal vein injection in the immune-competent mice. Clinical relevance was validated by digital spatial transcriptomic analysis of PDAC tumors. Kras mutation induces the formation of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), these lesions also exhibit significant apoptotic signals. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified a subset of ERK<sup>active</sup>DUSP2<sup>low</sup> cells continuing to expand from early to advanced stage PDAC. In vitro and in vivo studies reveal that early infiltrating macrophage-derived tissue inhibitor of metallopeptidase 1 (TIMP-1) is the key factor in maintaining the ERK<sup>active</sup>DUSP2<sup>low</sup> cell population in a CD63-dependent manner. The ERK<sup>active</sup>DUSP2<sup>low</sup> cancer cells further exacerbate macrophage-mediated cancer malignancy, including loss of epithelial trait, increased lymphangiogenesis, and immune escape. Digital spatial profiling analysis of PDAC samples demonstrates the colocalization of TIMP-1<sup>high</sup> macrophages and CD63<sup>high</sup> cancer cells. The presence of TIMP-1<sup>high</sup> macrophages and CD63<sup>high</sup> epithelial cells correlates with poor prognosis in PDAC. Our study reveals the vicious cycle between early infiltrating macrophages and pancreatic cancer cells, providing a mechanistic insight into the dynamic regulation directing pancreatic cancer progression.",

Despite its high incidence in White patients, advanced melanoma is rare in Asian countries, hampering prospective clinical trials targeting the Asian population. This retrospective study aimed to elucidate the real-world molecular diagnoses and outcomes of Japanese patients with melanoma using comprehensive genome profiling (CGP). Patients with melanoma who completed standard anticancer medical treatments (including those expected to complete the treatments) underwent CGP, which is covered by the National Health Insurance. We analyzed the results and clinical annotations of 569 patients registered before August 2023 in a national database. Skin, mucosal, and uveal melanomas accounted for 64%, 28%, and 7% of cases, respectively. Patients with <i>BRAF</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, <i>NF1</i>, and <i>KIT</i> variants represented 25%, 20%, 17%, and 17%, respectively. Eighty-two percent of <i>BRAF</i>, 97% of <i>NRAS</i>, 69% of <i>NF1</i>, and 54% of <i>KIT</i> were actionable alterations (ie, <i>BRAF</i> classes I, II, and III, <i>NRAS</i> Q61, G12, G13, <i>NF1</i> loss-of-function, <i>KIT</i> gain-of-function variants). <i>BRAF</i> V600E/K variants occurred in 22% of skin and 2% of mucosal melanomas, but not in uveal melanomas. The mean tumor mutation burden in cutaneous melanomas was 4.2 variants/Mb. Patients previously treated with BRAF-targeted therapy harbored amplifications of <i>BRAF</i> and cell cycle genes more frequently than therapy-naive patients. Thirty-six patients (6.3%) were treated following the molecular tumor board (MTB) recommendations. Actionable gene alterations in <i>BRAF</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, <i>NF1</i>, and <i>KIT</i> are common in Japanese patients with melanoma.

In all cases or in cases treated with platin, high expression of MFAP4 and EFEMP1 was linked to shortened overall survival and progression-free survival. MFAP4 and EFEMP1 were positively correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, TGF-\u03b2 signaling, KRAS signaling, and so on. The high expression groups of MFAP4 and EFEMP1 exhibited elevated stromal, immune, and ESTIMATE scores. Finally, we constructed a regulatory network involving lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions.

Identifying key genes involved in LIHC can enhance our understanding of its molecular mechanisms and aid in the development of targeted therapies. This study aims to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and key hub genes in LIHC using bioinformatics approaches and experimental validation. We analyzed two LIHC-related datasets, GSE84598 and GSE19665, from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify DEGs. Differential expression analysis was performed using the limma package in R to identify DEGs between cancerous and non-cancerous liver tissues. A Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network was constructed using STRING to determine key hub genes. Further validation of these hub genes was conducted through UALCAN, OncoDB, and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) databases for mRNA and protein expression levels. Promoter methylation and mutational analyses were performed using cBioPortal. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis assessed the impact of hub gene expression on patient survival. Correlations with immune cell abundance and drug sensitivity were explored using GSCA. Finally, AURKA was knocked down in HepG2 cells, and cell proliferation, colony formation, and wound healing assays were performed. Analysis identified 180 DEGs, with four key hub genes, including AURKA, BUB1B, CCNA2, and PTTG1 showing significant overexpression and hypomethylation in LIHC tissues. AURKA knockdown in HepG2 cells led to decreased cell proliferation, reduced colony formation, and impaired wound healing, confirming its role in LIHC progression. These hub genes were also hypomethylated and their elevated expression correlated with poor overall survival. AURKA, BUB1B, CCNA2, and PTTG1 are crucial for LIHC pathogenesis and may serve as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets. Our findings provide new insights into LIHC mechanisms and suggest promising avenues for future research and therapeutic development.",

          "abstract": "To explore the landscape of BRCA1/2 mutations in gastric cancer patients. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), Sanger sequencing, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), Immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), gnomAD, and DAVID. With 95% of bases boasting a phred score surpassing 30 and a minimum coverage depth of 500X, our NGS approach ensures high-quality data acquisition. Analyzing BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequences revealed 11 and 4 mutations, respectively, with one pathogenic mutation identified in each gene. This emphasizes the prominence of BRCA1 mutations in gastric cancer. Sanger sequencing validation confirmed the presence of pathogenic mutations in select cases, consolidating our findings. Frequency analysis utilizing the gnomAD database elucidated the rarity of these mutations in the Asian population, underscoring their uniqueness. Exploring TCGA data further corroborated this rarity, emphasizing the distinctive nature of these mutations in gastric cancer. RT-qPCR analysis unveiled a significant reduction in BRCA1/2 expression in samples harboring pathogenic mutations, hinting at their potential role in down-regulating gene expression. Immunohistochemistry confirmed diminished protein expression in samples with pathogenic mutations, solidifying our observations. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated significantly poorer survival outcomes for patients with pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations compared to those without, emphasizing their potential role in prognosis. Additionally, KEGG pathway analysis highlighted the involvement of BRCA1/2 in critical cancer-associated pathways, emphasizing their role in tumorigenesis. Our comprehensive findings underscore the clinical significance of BRCA1/2 mutations in gastric cancer, advocating for further research to elucidate their mechanistic implications and therapeutic opportunities.",

Subgroups of patients who share a phenotype might share a specific genetic architecture including protein-protein interactions (PPIs). We developed the Atlas of Protein-Protein Interactions in Cancer (APPIC), an interactive webtool that provides PPI subnetworks of 10 cancer types and their subtypes shared by cohorts of patients. To achieve this, we analyzed publicly available RNA sequencing data from patients and identified PPIs specific to 26 distinct cancer subtypes. APPIC compiles biological and clinical information from various databases, including the Human Protein Atlas, Hugo Gene Nomenclature Committee, g:Profiler, cBioPortal and Clue.io. The user-friendly interface allows for both 2D and 3D PPI network visualizations, enhancing the usability and interpretability of complex data. For advanced users seeking greater customization, APPIC conveniently provides all output files for further analysis and visualization on other platforms or tools. By offering comprehensive insights into PPIs and their role in cancer, APPIC aims to support the discovery of tumor subtype-specific novel targeted therapeutics and drug repurposing.

          "abstract": "The foremost feature of glioblastoma (GBM), the most frequent malignant brain tumours in adults, is a remarkable degree of intra- and inter-tumour heterogeneity reflecting the coexistence within the tumour bulk of different cell populations displaying distinctive genetic and transcriptomic profiles. GBM with primitive neuronal component (PNC), recently identified by DNA methylation-based classification as a peculiar GBM subtype (GBM-PNC), is a poorly recognized and aggressive GBM variant characterised by nodules containing cells with primitive neuronal differentiation along with conventional GBM areas. In addition, the presence of a PNC component has been also reported in IDH-mutant high-grade gliomas (HGGs), and to a lesser extent to other HGGs, suggesting that regardless from being IDH-mutant or IDH-wildtype, peculiar genetic and/or epigenetic events may contribute to the phenotypic skewing with the emergence of the PNC phenotype. However, a clear hypothesis on the mechanisms responsible for this phenotypic skewing is still lacking. We assumed that the biphasic nature of these entities represents a unique model to investigate the relationships between genetic alterations and their phenotypic manifestations. In this study we show that in HGGs with PNC features both components are highly enriched in genetic alterations directly causing cell cycle deregulation (RB inactivation or CDK4 amplification) and p53 pathway inactivation (TP53 mutations or MDM2/4 amplification). However, the PNC component displays further upregulation of transcriptional pathways associated with proliferative activity, including overexpression of MYC target genes. Notably, the PNC phenotype relies on the expression of EBF3, an early neurogenic transcription factor, which is directly controlled by MYC transcription factors in accessible chromatin sites. Overall our findings indicate that the concomitant presence of genetic alterations, impinging on both cell cycle and p53 pathway control, strongly predisposes GBM to develop a concomitant poorly differentiated primitive phenotype depending on MYC-driven EBF3 transcription in a subset of glioma stem-like progenitor cells.",

          "abstract": "The dysregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) represents a critical aspect of tumorigenesis. In this study, we investigated the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic aspects of the MMPs in SKCM. Thirteen SKCM cell lines and seven normal skin cell lines were cultured under standard conditions for experimental analyses. RNA and DNA were extracted, followed by RT-qPCR to assess MMP expression and promoter methylation analysis to determine methylation levels. Functional assays, including cell proliferation, colony formation, and wound healing, were conducted post-MMP7 knockdown using siRNA in A375 cells. Databases like GEPIA2, HPA, MEXPRESS, and miRNet were employed for expression, survival, methylation, and miRNA-mRNA network analyses. We investigated the expression and promoter methylation landscape of MMPs in SKCM cell lines, revealing significant (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05) up-regulation of MMP1, MMP7, MMP9, MMP10, MMP11, MMP12, MMP13, MMP14, and MMP25, alongside down-regulation of MMP2, MMP3, and MMP21. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrated a significant (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05) inverse correlation between MMP expression levels and promoter methylation status, suggesting a potential regulatory role of DNA methylation in MMP dysregulation. Notably, MMP7, MMP11, and MMP14 exhibited significant (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05) associations with the overall survival of SKCM patients, emphasizing their prognostic significance. Additionally, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis highlighted the significant (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05) diagnostic potential of MMP7, MMP11, and MMP14 in distinguishing SKCM from normal individuals. Subsequent validation across multiple cohorts confirmed significant (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05) elevated MMP expression levels in SKCM tissues, particularly in advanced disease stages, further emphasizing their role in tumor progression. Furthermore, we elucidated potential regulatory pathways involving miR-22-3p, which targets MMP7, MMP11, and MMP14 genes in SKCM. Our findings also revealed associations between MMP expression and immune modulation, drug sensitivity, and functional states of SKCM cells. Lastly, MMP7 knockdown in A375 cells significantly significant (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05) impacted several characteristics, including cell proliferation, colony formation, and wound healing. Our findings highlight the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic potential of MMP7, MMP11, and MMP14 in SKCM. These MMPs could serve as biomarkers for early detection and targets for therapy. Future efforts should focus on preclinical and clinical validation to translate these insights into personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",

Here, we establish a comprehensive transcriptional atlas across the spectrum of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) through RNA-sequencing of 158 primary samples encompassing CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and CD14+ monocytes. Supported by mass cytometry (CyTOF) profiling, we reveal aberrant networks of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling and NF\u03baB-mediated hyper-inflammation. Combining ATAC-Seq, CUT&Tag, RNA-seq, and CyTOF, we demonstrate that targeting of ribosomal protein S6 kinase A1 (RSK1) suppresses NF\u03baB activation and diminishes pro-inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) associated with MPN disease severity and transformation. We further evaluate a therapeutic approach utilizing a first-in-class RSK inhibitor, PMD-026, currently in Phase 2 development for breast cancer, for use in myeloid malignancies. Treatment with PMD-026 suppressed disease burden across seven syngeneic and patient-derived xenograft leukemia mouse models spanning the spectrum of driver and disease-modifying mutations.

          "abstract": "Cancer remains one of the most significant public health challenges worldwide. A widely recognized hallmark of cancer is the ability to sustain proliferative signaling, which is closely tied to various cell cycle processes. Centromere Protein A (CENPA), a variant of the standard histone H3, is crucial for selective chromosome segregation during the cell cycle. Despite its importance, a comprehensive pan-cancer bioinformatic analysis of CENPA has not yet been conducted. Data on genomes, transcriptomes, and clinical information were retrieved from publicly accessible databases. We analyzed CENPA's genetic alterations, mRNA expression, functional enrichment, association with stemness, mutations, expression across cell populations and cellular locations, link to the cell cycle, impact on survival, and its relationship with the immune microenvironment. Additionally, a prognostic model for glioma patients was developed to demonstrate CENPA's potential as a biomarker. Furthermore, drugs targeting CENPA in cancer cells were identified and predicted using drug sensitivity correlations and protein-ligand docking. CENPA exhibited low levels of gene mutation across various cancers. It was found to be overexpressed in nearly all cancer types analyzed in TCGA, relative to normal controls, and was predominantly located in the nucleus of malignant cells. CENPA showed a strong association with the cancer cell cycle, particularly as a biomarker for the G2 phase. It also emerged as a valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarker across multiple cancer types. In glioma, CENPA demonstrated reliable prognostic potential when used alongside other prognostic factors. Additionally, CENPA was linked to the immune microenvironment. Drugs such as CD-437, 3-Cl-AHPC, Trametinib, BI-2536, and GSK461364 were predicted to target CENPA in cancer cells. CENPA serves as a crucial biomarker for the cell cycle in cancers, offering both diagnostic and prognostic value.",

The integration of digital support and visualization tools is essential in this rapidly evolving field facing fast-growing data and changing clinical processes. This study addresses the gap in understanding the evolution of software and visualization needs within MTBs and evaluates the current state of digital support. Alignment between user requirements and software development is crucial to avoid waste of resources and maintain trust. In two consecutive nationwide medical informatics projects in Germany, surveys and expert interviews were conducted as stage 1 (n\u2009=\u200914), stage 2 (n\u2009=\u200930), and stage 3 (n\u2009=\u20099). Surveys, via the SoSci Survey tool, covered participants' roles, working methods, and support needs. The second survey additionally addressed requirements for visualization solutions in molecular tumor boards. These aimed to understand diverse requirements for preparation, implementation, and documentation. Nine semi-structured expert interviews complemented quantitative findings through open discussion. Using quantitative and qualitative analyses, we show that existing digital tools may improve therapy recommendations and streamline MTB case preparation, while continuous training and system improvements are needed. Our study contributes to the field by highlighting the importance of developing user-centric, customizable software solutions that can adapt to the fast-paced environment of MTBs to advance personalized oncology. In doing so, it lays the foundation for further advances in personalized medicine in oncology and points to a shift towards more efficient, technology-driven clinical decision-making processes.

Our study aims to identify similarities and differences of the clinical roles of CDCAs in breast cancer (BRCA) and to explore their potential mechanisms. In GEPIA, compared to normal tissues, expressions of CDCAs were higher in BRCA and sub-types. In addition, CDCAs were significantly positively related to stages and predicted worse survival in BRCA. In CancerSEA, expression levels of most CDCAs were strongly positively related to cell cycle, DNA damage, DNA repair, and proliferation. In TIMER, CDCAs were linked with immune infiltration levels of BRCA, including Dendritic cell, B cell and so on, and were positively related to most of the common markers of immune cells, especially CD38 of B cell and IL12RB2 of Th1. In GeneMANIA, there were complex interactions and co-expression relationships between CDCAs and cell division-associated genes. In addition, CDCA1, CDCA3, CDCA5, CDCA6 and CDCA8 had a high proportion of amplification in BRCA, and CDCA1, CDCA2, CDCA5, CDCA7 and CDCA8 had high levels of body DNA methylation. Among 11 transcription factors possibly combining promoters of all CDCAs, FOXP3 and YY1 were significantly higher in BRCA in comparison to normal tissues, and both had a positive relationship with all CDCAs in GEPIA and IHC. In addition, silencing FOXP3 or YY1 decreased levels of CDCAs in MDA-MB-231.

However, a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of RNF187 in human tumors has not been undertaken until now. Our study aims to investigate RNF187 expression across 33 different types of human tumors, utilizing data from the TCGA and GTEx databases. The pan-cancer analysis revealed significant upregulation of RNF187 in 27 types of cancers, contrasting with only low expression in LAML, with no statistical differences in OV and SARC. Notably, discernible associations were identified between RNF187 expression and the prognosis of cancer patients. Our investigation also unveiled correlations between RNA modification of RNF187 across various cancer types. Further exploration indicated a positive correlation between RNF187 levels and the presence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in numerous tumor types. Additionally, RNF187 exhibited correlations with a majority of immune inhibitory and stimulatory genes, as well as chemokines, receptors, MHC molecules, immunoinhibitors, and immunostimulators in various cancers. The findings highlighted associations between RNF187 expression and Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB), Microsatellite Instability (MSI) and Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) in specific tumors. Finally, RNF187 showed a significant positive association with five genes (ALKBH4, FAM134A, MLST8, SANP47 and TMEM9) across the majority of tumors.

          "abstract": "The aim of this study was to establish a primary mouse gastric carcinoma cell line. Gastric adenocarcinoma in the body region was induced in immunocompetent BALB/c mice using N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea and a 2% NaCl solution. Fresh gastric cancer tissue samples were cultured in 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for primary culture and subculture. Cellular morphology was assessed via light microscopy, and a cell growth curve was established. Genomic and proteomic analyses were conducted to characterize the molecular features of the cell lines. This cell line demonstrated a 100% success rate in forming subcutaneous tumors in BALB/c mice. By integrating proteomic profiles from clinical gastric cancer patients and the murine subcutaneous tumor model, several molecular targets suitable for preclinical investigation were identified. Trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, was employed as a model compound in our preclinical study. A novel gastric carcinoma cell line, designated MCC, was established from BALB/c mice. This cell line exhibited a doubling time of approximately 33\u00a0h. Genomic and proteomic analyses identified mutations frequently observed in clinical gastric cancer patients, such as Kras, Egfr, and Ccnd3. Additionally, MCC overexpresses proteins, including SLC1A5, MCM6, and ITGA2, which are significantly upregulated in gastric cancer tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The MCC cell line demonstrated stable tumorigenicity in immunocompetent BALB/c mice, forming subcutaneous tumors that closely resemble the proteomic profile of clinical gastric cancer samples. This high concordance facilitated the identification of several potential therapeutic targets for gastric cancer. Preclinical studies with trametinib revealed that treatment effectively inhibited gastric cancer growth, likely mediated through the activation of immune cells, particularly neutrophils and T cells. The MCC cell line serves as an indispensable model for gastric cancer research, offering a robust platform for investigating tumor development and progression. Its exceptional tumorigenic capacity and strong concordance with clinical proteomic profiles underscore its significance in translational research, facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and elucidation of molecular pathways critical for developing effective treatment strategies.",

The expression, diagnostic, and prognostic efficacy of five migrasome-related genes in HCC were analyzed using several databases. Five pairs of adjacent non-tumor tissues and HCC tissues were used to validate the expression. The prognostic efficacy of TSPAN4 was validated in a HCC cohort. TSPAN4 was knocked down in Huh-7 cells, EdU, and CCK-8, and wound healing assays were conducted to analyze its effects on cell proliferation and migration. In addition, transcriptomic sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed genes. Compared with those in normal tissues, four genes (TSPAN4, PIGK, NDST1, and CPQ) were elevated in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), but not TSPAN7. Of these, only elevated TSPAN4 predicted unfavorable prognosis of HCC patients. The expression and prognostic efficacy of TSPAN4 were further confirmed in a HCC cohort (97 patients); and patients in the TSPAN4<sup>high</sup> group showed unfavorable overall survival (log-rank P\u2009=\u20090.0055). Functional analysis showed that TSPAN4 knockdown significantly suppressed cell migration, but not cell proliferation. Moreover, TSPAN4 knockdown induced disturbances of the metabolic pathways, mainly pentose and glucuronate interconversions. TPSAN4 is a promising prognostic and therapeutic target for HCC treatment and may be involved in the metabolic pathways that affect disease progression.",

          "abstract": "Clear cell renal\u00a0cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is\u00a0a highly malignant tumor characterized by a significant propensity for recurrence and metastasis. DNA methylation has emerged as a critical epigenetic mechanism with substantial utility in cancer diagnosis. In this study, multi-omics data were utilized to investigate the target genes regulated by the transcription factor MYC-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) in ccRCC, leading to the identification of thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP) as a gene with notably elevated expression in ccRCC. The interaction between MAZ and TYMP was confirmed through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and bioinformatics analysis. It was found that the binding of MAZ to the TYMP promoter is associated with the methylation status of this promoter region. Furthermore, the methylation of the TYMP promoter appears to be correlated with both the clinicopathological stage and overall survival of ccRCC patients. Further exploration of genes within the \"nucleotide metabolism\" pathway, identified through Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, revealed that uridine phosphorylase 1 (UPP1) interacts with TYMP. Interestingly, UPP1 was also shown to be activated by MAZ, suggesting a coordinated regulatory mechanism. Based on these findings, we propose that the TYMP-UPP1 complex, co-regulated by MAZ, plays a pivotal role in nucleotide metabolism in ccRCC. These results suggest that TYMP may contribute to the pathophysiology of ccRCC and that promoter methylation offers potential as a prognostic indicator, providing novel insights into the molecular underpinnings of ccRCC and potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.",

          "abstract": "Previous data show that the knockdown of the <i>MYBL1</i> gene in the MDA-MB-231 cell line leads to the downregulation of <i>VCPIP1</i> gene expression. In addition, <i>MYBL1</i> and <i>VCPIP1</i> genes are co-expressed and dysregulated in some of the same triple negative breast cancer patient samples. We propose that the co-expression of the two genes is attributed to the MYBL1 transcription factor regulation of the <i>VCPIP1</i> gene. We identify the MYBL1 transcription factor binding site upstream of the VCPIP1 start site and show that the MYBL1 protein can bind to the sequence identified in the VCPIP1 promoter region. Combined with the results from the knockdown study, these data support the ability of <i>MYBL1</i> to regulate the <i>VCPIP1</i> gene. The <i>VCPIP1</i> gene functions as a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in DNA repair, protein positioning, and the assembly of the Golgi apparatus during mitotic signaling. The transcriptional regulation of VCPIP1 by the <i>MYBL1</i> gene could implicate MYBL1 in these processes, which might contribute to tumor processes in TNBC. Although both genes are involved in cell cycle regulatory mechanisms, converging signaling mechanisms have not been identified. In a separate study, we performed sequence alignment of the MYBL1 transcript variants and identified an exon unique to the canonical variant. Probes that specifically target the unique <i>MYBL1</i> exon show that the exon is overexpressed in tumor cell lines compared to non-tumor breast cells. We are classifying this unique MYBL1 exon as a tumor-associated exon.",

Motivated by a recent discovery of the significance of DNMT3A-destabilizing mutations (DNMT3A<sup>INS</sup>) in AML, we here investigate the common characteristics of DNMT3A<sup>INS</sup> AML methylomes through computational analyses. We present that methylomes of DNMT3A<sup>INS</sup> AMLs are considerably different from those of DNMT3A<sup>R882</sup> AMLs in that they exhibit increased intratumor DNA methylation heterogeneity in bivalent chromatin domains. This epigenetic heterogeneity was associated with the transcriptional variability of developmental and membrane-associated factors shaping stem cell niche, and also was a predictor of the response of AML cells to hypomethylating agents, implying that the survival of AML cells depends on stochastic DNA methylations at bivalent domains. Altogether, our work provides a novel mechanistic model suggesting the genomic origin of the aberrant epigenomic heterogeneity in disease conditions.",

KRAS mutations are one of the significant mechanisms underlying the occurrence, development, immune escape, and chemotherapy resistance of NSCLC. Two KRAS inhibitors are approved by Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of NSCLC in the past 3\u00a0years. However, they are only effective to KRAS G12C mutant, and moreover, innate and acquired drug resistance is already reported, leaving an urgent need to block KRAS pathways through novel targets. In this study, we focused on the discovery of ligands targeting the RNA G-quadruplexes in 5'-UTR of KRAS mRNA, and a novel tribenzophenazine analog (MBD) was identified as the lead compound. Further mechanisms were discussed in A549/DDP cells, a cisplatin-resistant and KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell line. Antitumor efficacy was verified both in\u00a0vitro in A549/DDP cells, and in\u00a0vivo in a nude mouse xenograft model implanted with A549/DDP cells. To sum up, our results suggest the potential of MBD as a prominent anti-KRAS-driven NSCLC agent and propose a new idea for the development of small molecule ligands targeting KRAS RNA G-quadruplexes.",

          "abstract": "Recurrent missense mutations in the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) have been identified across various human cancers. Among these mutations, the active S310F mutation in the HER2 extracellular domain stands out as not only oncogenic but also confers resistance to pertuzumab, an antibody drug widely used in clinical cancer therapy, by impeding its binding. In this study, we have successfully employed computational-aided rational design to undertake directed evolution of pertuzumab, resulting in the creation of an evolved pertuzumab variant named Ptz-SA. This variant, with only two mutations (T30S/D31A) located on its heavy chain, effectively reinstates binding to the mutated antigen, at the expense of a 35-fold reduction in binding affinity to HER2 (S310F) compared to the wild-type pair. Subsequently, Ptz-SA demonstrates potent killing capacity through antigen-dependent cytotoxicity. Moreover, upon engineering Ptz-SA into antibody-drug conjugates, such as Ptz-SA-MMAE, it manifests notable in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy by efficiently delivering cytotoxic payload into tumor cells expressing HER2 (S310F). Cryoelectron microscopy studies elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the restored binding ability of Ptz-SA toward the S310F mutation. The steric hindrance induced by the S310F mutation is efficiently circumvented by the T30S and D31A mutations, which provides adequate space to accommodate the larger phenylalanine. Additionally, Ptz-SA also exhibits binding capacity to HER2 (S310Y), another mutation occurring at the S310 site of HER2 with high frequency. The computational-aided evolution of pertuzumab provides an alternative strategy for overcoming point mutation-mediated resistance to therapeutic antibodies.",

RET-altered cancer patients treated with RET-selective kinase inhibitors gain weight, however, it is unclear whether this results from tumor regression that improves the overall health of patients. Thus, the potential of using a RET inhibitor to address cancer cachexia remains unknown. Using a RET-negative tumor model, we evaluated the activity of the RET-selective inhibitor selpercatinib (LOXO-292) against cancer cachexia. In tumor-bearing animals, selpercatinib significantly increased food consumption, skeletal muscle mass and strength, adipose tissues, and body temperature, as well as reducing body weight loss, without significantly affecting tumor growth. Transcriptomes of skeletal muscle from mock-treated tumor-bearing mice were enriched in starvation and muscle atrophy genes, whereas those from selpercatinib-treated mice were enriched in myoblast proliferation, gluconeogenesis, and insulin receptor signaling genes. In parallel, retrospective analysis of weight gain in selpercatinib-treated patients showed that weight gain was not correlated with tumor response to selpercatinib. Our data demonstrate that selpercatinib could alleviate anorexia and cancer cachexia in an animal model and that weight gain in selpercatinib-treated patients is not dependent on tumor regression. These results identify a RET inhibitor as the first protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor for mitigating cancer cachexia.",

Exportins, critical mediators of nuclear export, have emerged as potential players in cancer pathogenesis. However, their precise roles and prognostic significance in colon adenocarcinoma remain elusive. This study was designed to comprehensively analyse the expression and prognostic significance of all seven exportins in Colon Adenocarcinoma (COAD) using the online public database. We used public databases UALCAN, C-Bio portal, Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and DAVID, to investigate exportins in COAD patients. Kaplan-Meier plotter, Gene ontology (GO), TIMER, STRING, and KEGG were used to analyse data and draw conclusions. Our observations showed a significant correlation of exportins expression with clinical parameters, used to predict a patient's prognosis in general, such as advancing tumor stage, overall/relapse-free survival, and immune cell infiltrations. Mutation analysis showed the presence of amplifications, missense mutations in XPO2 and XPO4, and deep deletions in XPO7 genes contributing to disease progression and patients survival.

Our analysis covered its clinical significance and biological functions, including expression levels, survival and diagnostic analysis, gene mutations, multidimensional immune-correlation analysis, tumor heterogeneity, and cancer-associated signaling pathways. Additionally, we constructed a prognostic nomogram for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients based on MRPL21 and validated its biological function through in vitro experiments. Our findings revealed that MRPL21 is commonly overexpressed in various cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. It significantly impacts cancer-related pathways, particularly those related to cell cycle activation. Moreover, MRPL21 is critical in the tumor microenvironment and is closely linked to immune infiltration across several cancer types. Its expression correlates with essential factors such as tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, immune checkpoint, and methylation patterns.

          "abstract": "Inhibin, \u03b2, which is also known as INHBA, encodes a protein that belongs to the Transforming Growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in cancer. Gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) cancer refers to the cancers that develop in the colon, liver, esophagus, stomach, rectum, pancreas, and bile ducts of the digestive system. The role of INHBA in all GI tract cancers remains understudied. By utilizing GEPIA2, which uses transcriptomic data from TCGA, we examined the expression of INHBA across different GI tract cancers. The results revealed consistent upregulation of INHBA in all TCGA GI tract cancers, except for liver hepatocellular carcinoma, where it showed downregulation compared to normal tissues, along with GTEx normal samples. Significant differences in INHBA expression were noted in adenocarcinomas of the colon, pancreas, rectum, and stomach, while no such differences were observed in cholangiocarcinoma and liver cancer. Moreover, a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis has been done to demonstrate that the differences in expression levels are significantly related to pathological tumor stages and prognosis in different GI tract cancers. Mucinous adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma show a higher frequency of INHBA alteration and are primarily linked to mutations and amplifications. DNA methylation, immune infiltration, functional enrichment analysis, the genes associated with INHBA, and survival analysis in all TCGA GI tract cancers have been extensively analyzed. In colon and stomach cancers, increased INHBA expression significantly correlates with poorer overall survival (OS). However, in colon and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, higher expression is significantly associated with worse disease-free survival (DFS). Additionally, INHBA expression exhibited a positive correlation with cancer-associated fibroblasts across all gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that INHBA and its interacting proteins are involved in several pathways, including TGF-beta signaling, Signalling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, AGE-RAGE signaling, and so on as major pathways. These findings demonstrate that INHBA could serve as a potential biomarker therapeutic target for GI tract cancer.",

          "abstract": "The mutational landscape of TP53, a tumor suppressor mutated in about half of all cancers, includes over 2,000 known missense mutations. To fully leverage TP53 mutation status for personalized medicine, a thorough understanding of the functional diversity of these mutations is essential. We conducted a deep mutational scan using saturation genome editing with CRISPR-mediated homology-directed repair to engineer 9,225 TP53 variants in cancer cells. This high-resolution approach, covering 94.5% of all cancer-associated TP53 missense mutations, precisely mapped the impact of individual mutations on tumor cell fitness, surpassing previous deep mutational scan studies in distinguishing benign from pathogenic variants. Our results revealed even subtle loss-of-function phenotypes and identified promising mutants for pharmacological reactivation. Moreover, we uncovered the roles of splicing alterations and nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay in mutation-driven TP53 dysfunction. These findings underscore the power of saturation genome editing in advancing clinical TP53 variant interpretation for genetic counseling and personalized cancer therapy.",

          "abstract": "Deletion of the long q arm of chromosome 22 (22qDEL) is the most frequently identified recurrent somatic copy number alteration observed in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Since its role in PTC is not fully understood, we conducted a pooled analysis of genomic characteristics and clinical correlates in 1094 primary tumors from four published PTC genomic studies. The majority of PTC cases with 22qDEL exhibited arm-level loss of heterozygosity (86%); nearly all PTC cases with 22qDEL had losses in 22q12 and 13, which together constitute 70% of the q arm. Our analysis confirmed that 22qDEL occurs more frequently with RAS point mutations (50.4%), particularly HRAS (70.3%), compared with other PTC drivers (9.3%), supporting the conclusion that 22qDEL is unlikely to be a solitary driver of PTC but possibly an important co-factor in carcinogenesis, particularly in PTCs with RAS driver mutations. Differential RNA expression analyses revealed downregulation of most genes located on chromosome 22 in cases with 22qDEL compared to those without 22qDEL. Many differentially expressed genes are drawn from immune response and regulation pathways. These findings highlight the value of further investigations into the contributions of 22qDEL events to PTC, perhaps mediated through immune perturbations.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent malignancy in women. Potential therapeutic targets for BC are of great significance. In our previous study, we found that prenylated rab acceptor 1 domain family member 2 (PRAF2) is an oncogene in BC. However, the exact mechanism of PRAF2 in BC cancer promotion is still not fully understood. Pan-cancer analysis of PRAF2 was performed in the TIMER, Kaplan\u2012Meier, UALCAN and GEPIA databases.The prognostic value of PRAF2 in BC was investigated in the GEPIA database. The influence of PRAF2 on immune infiltration in BC was analyzed in the TISIDE and TIMER databases. Finally, we validated the expression of PRAF2 in our institutional samples. After downregulating PRAF2 in two BC cell lines, we tested cell proliferation by CCK-8 and Wound healing assays. PRAF2 was highly expressed in various cancers, including BC, and in most BC cell lines. Higher expression of PRAF2 indicated poorer overall survival (OS) but not disease-free survival (DFS). Higher expression of PRAF2 is an independent prognostic factor in BC.PRAF2 is more highly expressed in BC than in the corresponding normal tissues. Downregulation of PRAF2 in BC can significantly inhibit viability and migration. PRAF2 is highly expressed in various cancers, including BC. The expression of PRAF2 is related to Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation in BC. Finally, PRAF2 is upregulated in BC based on our institutional data. Downregulation of PRAF2 significantly inhibits cellular viability\u3001migration in BC. PRAF2 may be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for BC.",

          "abstract": "Cancer, the most common condition worldwide, ranks second in terms of the number of human deaths, surpassing cardiovascular diseases. Uncontrolled cell multiplication and resistance to cell death are the traditional features of cancer. The myriad of treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy to treat this disease. Conventional chemotherapy drug delivery suffers from issues such as the risk of damage to benign cells, which can cause toxicity, and a few tumor cells withstand apoptosis, thereby increasing the likelihood of developing tolerance. The side effects of cancer chemotherapy are often more pronounced than its benefits. Regarding drugs used in cancer chemotherapy, their bioavailability and stability in the tumor microenvironment are the most important issues that need immediate addressing. Hence, an effective and reliable drug delivery system through which both rapid and precise targeting of treatment can be achieved is urgently needed. In this work, we discuss the development of various nanobased carriers in the advancement of cancer therapy-their properties, the potential of polymers for drug delivery, and recent advances in formulations. Additionally, we discuss the use of tumor metabolism-rewriting nanomedicines in strengthening antitumor immune responses and mRNA-based nanotherapeutics in inhibiting tumor progression. We also examine several issues, such as nanotoxicological studies, including their distribution, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology. Although significant attention is being given to nanotechnology, equal attention is needed in laboratories that produce nanomedicines so that they can record themselves in clinical trials. Furthermore, these medicines in clinical trials display overwhelming results with reduced side effects, as well as their ability to modify the dose of the drug.",
